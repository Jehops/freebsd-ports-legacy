French language alphabet and number sounds for the Childsplay game

Childsplay is a 'suite' of educational games for young children, like gcompris,
but without the overkill of c/c++ and the gnome environ.:-)
Also the use of the SDL libraries makes smooth animation and the playing of 
sound very easy.
Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so you might want to check 
the childsplay-plugins page.
(There are two built-in games; Memory and a typing game)

Childsplay and the games are GNU-GPL licensed and are tested on GNU/Linux 
and the Windows platforms. (and now, FreeBSD)
