Xtel has been installed on %%PREFIX%%/bin/xtel.

In order to use it, you have to edit the file /etc/services
and add the line:

xtel            1313/tcp   #xtel Minitel emulator

Then you have to edit the file /etc/inetd.conf (or its equivalent
if you run another internet services daemon) and add the line:

xtel	stream	tcp	nowait	root	%%PREFIX%%/bin/xteld	xteld

Force the super-daemon to re-read its configuration file by
killall -1 inetd

If your modem is plugged to /dev/cuaax (where x = 0, 1, 2,...)
detect its initialization string by:

mdmdetect cuaax

After some time while your computer should be dialoguing with the
modem, you should get such a line

ModemModel , 38400 \dat&fm1e0&k3f3\r-OK

Take note of the second (speed) and last parameters, and report them
into the file %%PREFIX%%/lib/X11/xtel/xtel.lignes so that you have a
line like this one:

modem0,/dev/cuaa0,38400,7,E,\dat&fm1e0&k3f3\r OK atdt\T\r CONNECT,30

where cuaa0 should be adjusted to your port number, 38400 to the speed
detected by mdmdetect, and where the string included between "E," and atdt
corresponds to the third parameter (Note that the "-" has been replaced by
a space).

To end, you just have to install the fonts, either by entering
xset +fp %%PREFIX%%/lib/X11/fonts/xtel
xset fp rehash
or by adding %%PREFIX%%/lib/X11/fonts/xtel to FontPath in your
XF86Config.
