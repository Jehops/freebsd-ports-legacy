The Hebrew Editor package is intended mostly for Hebrew speaking users for 
creating and editing Hebrew/English LaTeX documents.
 
This package provides a text (terminal) based word processor (in the spirit 
of the  good-old DOS days word processors) which is extreamly LaTeX (or 
rather LaXeT) oriented.
