This addon was designed as a replacement for the netsaint_statd and
nrpe addons. Although this addon is similar in function to nrpe, it
is written in Perl and implements TripleDES encryption for the data in
transit. It is also designed to run under inetd and make use of the
TCP Wrappers package for access control.
