You can mostly follow the guide at:
http://docs.librenms.org/

with the following notes:
- Installation directory is %%WWWDIR%%

NOTE: setting sql-mode="" is no longer required. You can remove
it from /usr/local/etc/mysql/my.cnf

HEADS UP

Polling via cron job is now deprecated. Please use the Dispatcher.

LibreNMS will be dropping support for PHP 7.1 and Python 2 in the next release
expected May 31 2020.  see https://community.librenms.org/t/dropping-support-for-php-7-1-and-python-2/11851

Your existing crontab entries for the PYPOLLER option will be going away.

You can migrate to the PYSERVICE option of LibreNMS now
(also known as the Dispatcher Service).

The next release will not include the the PYPOLLER option.

PYROLLER (deprecated) configuration (default):

The following lines should be added to /etc/crontab:

PATH=/etc:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
33	*/6	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PHP%% discovery.php -h all >> /dev/null 2>&1
*/5	*	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PHP%% discovery.php -h new >> /dev/null 2>&1
*/5	*	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PYTHON%% poller-wrapper.py 16 >> /dev/null 2>&1
15	0	*	*	*	www	%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/bash %%WWWDIR%%/daily.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1
*	*	*	*	*	www	%%PHP%% %%WWWDIR%%/alerts.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
*/5 	*	*	*	*	www	%%PHP%% %%WWWDIR%%/poll-billing.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
01	*	*	*	*	www	%%PHP%% %%WWWDIR%%/billing-calculate.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
*/5	*	*	*	*	www	%%PHP%% %%WWWDIR%%/check-services.php >> /dev/null 2>&1

PYSERVICE configuration (non-default):

Enable the poller service with this command:

sysrc librenms_enable="YES"

The service will log to /var/log/librems/librenms-service.log

see also https://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Dispatcher-Service/

When converting from PYPOLLER to the Dispatcher Service (PYSERVICE),
these steps will help you get started:

* compile with PYSERVICE enabled and PYPOLLER disabled
* comment out the crontab entries listed above under PYPOLLER
* populate %%WWWDIR%%/.env with:
  * APP_KEY - see farther below for how to create
  * NODE_ID - see just below for how to create
  * DB_HOST
  * DB_DATABASE
  * DB_USERNAME
  * DB_PASSWORD
* you can create a NODE_ID with: php -r 'echo uniqid() . "\n";'

When setting up a new install, you need a %%WWWDIR%%/.env file.

You need an APP_KEY.

To create:

cd %%WWWDIR%%
cp -i .env.example .env

That file will eventually contain secrets.  Make sure it is not world-readable.

When migrating to PYSERVICE (also known as the Dispatcher Service):

It is also a good idea to:
cd %%WWWDIR%%
./validate

Database connection details are required in that file.

Then run:

php artisan key:generate

The output should look something like this:

**************************************
*     Application In Production!     *
**************************************

 Do you really wish to run this command? (yes/no) [no]:
 > y

Application key [base64:P62La9V........qw=] set successfully.

After that, follow the LibreNMS documentation for configuration.
