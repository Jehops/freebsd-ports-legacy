This is an interactive configuration editor for Cisco devices. It is based on
joe editor's macros that let you load either running or startup configuration
from a Cisco router/switch/access server directly into the editor and commit
it back after modification.

The CiscoConf program maintains the database of previous versions of startup
and running configurations for each router in /var/db/CiscoConf. The
number of versions to keep is specified in its configuration file.

It also provides locking to prevent concurrent editing of the same
configuration by more than one person.
