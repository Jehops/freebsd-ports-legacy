Cacti templates you'll find online are often poor quality and have many
problems. Cacti's design can also cause inefficiency if you don't know how to
use it correctly, and most templates don't avoid those inefficiencies. The
templates offered by this project should work around all of these problems,
which are pretty common in other templates:

- No duplicated data in RRD files.

- No unused data in RRD files.

- No wasted polling for the same data over and over, so your Cacti installation
  won't start timing out.

The project is also known as mysql-cacti-templates, for historical reasons. But
it offers many more kinds of templates.
