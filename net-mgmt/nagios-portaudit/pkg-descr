This is a small Nagios plugin. This plugin relies on portaudit
and/or portupgrade packages to be installed on your FreeBSD system.
With these packages installed, the plugin will scan your system for
either vulnerable packages, or obsolete packages - and display
appropriate warnings to Nagios.

Portaudit can also be successfully run remotely from nrpe, and does
not require superuser privileges to operate.
