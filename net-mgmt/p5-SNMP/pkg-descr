This is a Perl5 extension module which provides an interface to the
CMU-SNMPv2 library.

Description:

The basic operations offered by SNMP are provided through an object
oriented interface for modularity and ease of use. The primary object is
SNMP::Session which is implemented as a blessed hash reference. The
object supports 'get', 'set', and 'getNext' method calls. All calls are
blocking/synchronous (i.e., they must receive a response or timeout
before control is returned to the caller). The methods take a variety of
input argument formats(see test.pl and examp/* for examples). A
description of the objects data fields follow.

SNMP::Session
 DestHost - default 'localhost', hostname or ip addr of SNMP agent
 Community - default 'public', SNMP community string
 Version - default '1', v1 support only for now
 Timeout - default '1000000', micro-seconds before retry
 Retries - default '5', retries before failure
 RetryNoSuch - default '1', for get request NOSUCH errors, the pdu will
               be repaired, removing the varbind in error, and resent -
               undef will be returned for all NOSUCH varbinds, setting
               to '0' disables this feature and the entire get request
               will fail on any NOSUCH error
 ErrorStr - read-only, returns a test description of any error occuring
            in the last request
 ErrorNum - read-only, returns the snmp_err or staus of last request
            private
 DestAddr - internal field used to hold the translated DestHost field
 SessPtr - internal field used to cache a created session structure
