Ettercap is a network sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN.
It uses ARP poisoning and the man-in-the-middle technique to sniff all
the connections between two host.

It's possible to sniff in three modes:

   + IP Based, the packets are filtered on IP source and dest
   + MAC Based, packets filtered on mac address, useful to sniff
     connections through gateway
   + ARP based, uses arp poisoning to sniff in switched lan.

Ettercap also supports character injection and plugins.
