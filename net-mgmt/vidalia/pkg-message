If your Onion Router isn't listening on 127.0.0.1,
you can build the Vidalia port with TOR_CONTROL_ADDR
set to something else. You can't change this address
through Vidalia's GUI.

Note that Vidalia requires systray support to do anything
useful (you need the systray icon to open Vidalia's windows).

If your Window Manager doesn't have a systray, you can
install x11/stalonetray or another systray provider through
the ports.

The systray provider has to be running before you start
Vidalia. Vidalia doesn't show any error messages if
no systray was found!
