If your Onion Router isn't listening on 127.0.0.1,
either build the Vidalia port with TOR_CONTROL_ADDR
set to the Onion Router's IP address, or specify it
with the ControlAddr variable in the "[Tor]" section
of ~/.vidalia/vidalia.conf. Example:

 [Tor]
 ControlAddr=10.0.0.2

Note that Vidalia requires systray support to do anything
useful (you need the systray icon to open Vidalia's windows).

If your Window Manager doesn't have a systray, you can
install x11/stalonetray or another systray provider through
the ports.

The systray provider has to be running before you start
Vidalia. Vidalia doesn't show any error messages if
no systray was found!
