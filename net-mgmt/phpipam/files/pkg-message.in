Automatic installation of database files
---------------------------------------------
Since v0.4 phpipam can automatically install database files for you.
Point browser to phpipam directory and set MySQL login details (root 
username and password).

Finished! Launch browser, go to website and if something is missing / not 
configured properly the error will appear.

Manual installation of database files
------------------------------------------
Optional method to be used instead of automatic configuration.

MySQL schema file is available under db folder.
First you must create new database, and then import SCHEMA file into 
database. Instructions below are for command-line import with local mysql 
installation.
------
mysql -u root -p 
create database phpipam;
exit
------

Import database SCHEME.sql file:
------
mysql -u root -p phpipam < db/SCHEMA.sql
------

Create user for database interaction from website and grant permissions to 
ipam tables. Please change the username and password (ipv6, ipv6admin) 
according to your needs - you must also replace default ones in config file.
------
mysql -u root -p
grant ALL on phpipam.* to ipv6@localhost identified by "ipv6admin";
exit
------

%%DISTNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%WWWDIR%%

Example Apache config:

    Alias /phpipam/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/">
        Options none
        AllowOverride Limit

        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>

config.php is where site configuration and database details are configured.

Default user/password is Admin/ipamadmin
