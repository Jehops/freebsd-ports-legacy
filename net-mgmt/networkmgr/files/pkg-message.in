Any bug reports or request for new feature should be addressed at:
    https://github.com/GhostBSD/networkmgr/issues

Make sure that the %%PREFIX%%/etc/doas.conf file has something similar to this:

    permit nopass keepenv root
    permit :wheel
    permit nopass keepenv :wheel cmd netcardmgr
    permit nopass keepenv :wheel cmd ifconfig
    permit nopass keepenv :wheel cmd service
    permit nopass keepenv :wheel cmd wpa_supplicant
    permit nopass keepenv :wheel cmd killall args wpa_supplicant

When rebooting it should automatically start if the desktop supports xdg
and make sure that the user using NetworkMgr is in the wheel group.
