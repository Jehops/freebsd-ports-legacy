This perl module provides a simple interface to the tedious bit
manipulation involved when handling IP address calculations. It also
helps by performing range comparisons between subnets as well as other
frequently used functions.

Please note that this module provides more functionality when used with
perl 5.6.1 or perl 5.8.0.
