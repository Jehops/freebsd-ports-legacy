This is not an "easy" port. You have to take many things into consideration,
what flow data to collect (disk space, etc), how and when to remove unneeded
flow files. And you have to know, what it is all about. If you don't know 
Cisco NetFlow switching and its data export feature, then I recommend you
to deinstall this port.

Prerequisites:
A) You need to read the installation instructions closely, see:
	${PREFIX}/share/doc/flowscan/INSTALL

B) You need to configure your Cisco Router, to enable Netflow Switching
   and Netflow data export.

PLEASE NOTE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW EXACTLY, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ENABLE NETFLOW
SWITCHING ON YOUR CISCO CORE OR DISTRIBUTION ROUTERS, WHAT PERFORMANCE IMPACT
MIGHT BE INVOLVED WHEN DOING THIS, WITH THE GOAL, NOT TO LOOSE YOUR ROUTING/
SWITCHING PERFORMANCE. BE WARNED !!!

Post-installation tasks involve:
a)	Configure cflowd properly for your needs, see above mentioned docu !
	Example files reside in ${PREFIX}/etc, files:
		cflowd.conf.example and cfdcollect.conf
b)	Configure flowscan, see above mentioned docu !
	Example files reside in ${PREFIX}/var/db/flows/bin, files:
		"foo".sample ...
c)	Customize and install crontab file, example see:
		${PREFIX}/share/doc/flowscan/crontab.sample
d)	Activate flowscan startscript by renaming it as usual, see example in:
		${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/flowscan.sh.sample
e)	Create graphs using make by customizing the sample Makefile, see docu !
		${PREFIX}/var/db/flows/graphs/Makefile.sample
	Please note, that the Makefile has to be reconfigured if you add
	or remove protocols in ${PREFIX}/var/db/flows/bin/CampusIO.cf !
