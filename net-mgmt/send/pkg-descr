DoCoMo's Open Source SEND project provides an implementation of
RFC3971 Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND). SEND cryptographically
secures the IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol, countering the threats
discussed in RFC3756 (IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and
Threats).

DoCoMo's SEND is implemented completely in user space, so it is
portable and lends itself to experimentation. It currently runs on
Linux (tested on 2.6 kernels) and FreeBSD (tested on 5.4).

Also included in the distribution are implementations of RFC3972
Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) and RFC3779 X.509
Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers.
