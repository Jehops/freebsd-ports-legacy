When troubleshooting network issues, it can be very useful to have all the 
interface graphs for a device on the same screen. This helps with spotting 
trends, or tracing where traffic is flowing through a switch or router. The 
only way to natively achieve this with Zenoss is to create a graph or 
multi-graph report for every network device manually, which can be a chore 
if you have more than a few network devices.
 
This ZenPack provides a new link on the left side of a device detail view 
called "Interface Graphs" - this view shows the graphs for all of the network 
interfaces on the device in one place, allowing for fast spotting of issues 
or traffic flows. Both the interface name and the description (if any) are 
used to title the graphs to aid with identification.
 
Note that with stacked switches, you can end up with a very large number of 
graphs on the page, so tuning this slightly via the configuration properties 
below could be a good idea in these situations.
