=================================================================

SmokePing has now been installed in %%PREFIX%%/smokeping/.

NOTE: A set of sample configuration files have been installed:

  %%ETCDIR%%/config
  %%ETCDIR%%/smokemail
  %%ETCDIR%%/basepage.html
  %%ETCDIR%%/tmail

You *MUST* edit these to suit your requirements. Please read the
manpages 'smokeping_install' and 'smokeping_config' for further
details on installation and configuration.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Smokeping, the
manpage 'smokeping_upgrade' may be of help.

Once configured, you can start SmokePing by adding:

  smokeping_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf, and then running, as root:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/smokeping start

To enable Apache web access, add something like the following to
your %%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf:

  DocumentRoot %%PREFIX%%/smokeping/htdocs
  ScriptAlias /smokeping.cgi %%PREFIX%%/smokeping/htdocs/smokeping.cgi
  ScriptAlias /tr.cgi %%PREFIX%%/smokeping/htdocs/tr.cgi

Enjoy!
