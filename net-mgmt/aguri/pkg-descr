Aguri is an aggregation-based traffic profiler targeted for near real-time,
long-term, and wide-area traffic monitoring. Aguri adapts itself to spatial
traffic distribution by aggregating small volume flows into aggregates, and
achieves temporal aggregation by creating a summary of summaries applying the
same algorithm to its outputs. A set of scripts are used for archiving and
visualizing summaries in different time scales. Aguri does not need a
predefined rule set and is capable of detecting an unexpected increase of
unknown protocols or DoS attacks, which considerably simplifies the task of
network monitoring.

Aguri produces four separate profiles for source addresses, destination
addresses, source protocols and destination protocols. IP addresses are
designed to be hierarchical and aggregatable so that it is natural to apply
aggregation. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported in address profiles. Although
protocol numbers are not hierarchical, the same technique can be used to
identify port ranges. We concatenate the IP version, the protocol number and
the TCP/UDP port number to create a 32-bit key for a protocol profile.
