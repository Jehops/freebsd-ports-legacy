NeTAMS stands for Network Traffic Accounting and Monitoring Software. 
It is built for UNIX and works for networks with Cisco routers or PC Unix 
routers (Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris). Several methods of traffic gathering are 
supported (tee/divert/ip_queue/libpcap/ulog/netflow v5 and v9/netgraph), 
database storage (BerkleyDB/MySQL/PostgresSQL/Oracle/Radius), aggregation, 
visualization, notification etc. It is possible to block traffic based on 
quotas, web authorization, account balance (billing); manage bandwidth, 
MAC assignmant violations, RADIUS services, create a flexible accounting 
and filtering policies.
