Notes:

 * See the documentation at http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html

 * Requires that net-mgmt/nagios be built with WITH_EVENT_BROKER=yes or
   livestatus.o will never be loaded...

 * unixcat (for use with reading from the socket and/or inetd(8) support)
   moved to $LOCALBASE/lib/mk-livestatus from $LOCALBASE/bin in
   order to avoid a conflict with sysutils/ucspi-unix
