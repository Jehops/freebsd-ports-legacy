TwistedSNMP is a set of SNMP protocol implementations for Python's
Twisted Matrix networking framework using the PySNMP project. It
provides the following:
 * get, set, getnext and getbulk Manager-side queries
 * get, set, getnext and getbulk Agent-side services

Eventual goals of the system:
 * provide access to all v1 and v2 SNMP functionality for writing
   Agent and Manager services
 * provide convenient testing mechanisms for SNMP Agent/Manager
   development (e.g. mirroring an SNMP Agent's OID tree for local
   query testing)
