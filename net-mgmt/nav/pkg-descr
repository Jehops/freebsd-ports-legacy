Network Administration Visualized is an advanced software suite to monitor
large computer networks. It automatically discovers network topology, monitors
network load and outages, and can send alerts on network events by e-mail and
SMS, allowing for flexible configuration of alert profiles.

NAV was developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
Development started in 1999. It originated as a collection of scripts used
internally at NTNU's ITEA Network group. In 2001 UNINETT became interested in
its development, and has since been funding NAV development at NTNU on behalf
of all universities and colleges in Norway.
