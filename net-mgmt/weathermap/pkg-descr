Network Weathermap is a perl tool that displays in a visual way the utilization
of the network links of your network. The required data are acquired from 
graphs created by the MRTG package and are displayed as two ways colored arrows
on a map representing the logical topology of the network. The resulted image 
is presented in a web page using extra DHTML and JavaScript code for web-over 
pop-ups, based on the OverLib JavaScript library.
