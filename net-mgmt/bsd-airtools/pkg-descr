bsd-airtools is a package that provides a complete toolset for
wireless 802.11b auditing. Namely, it currently contains a bsd-based
wep cracking application, called dweputils. It also contains a curses
based ap detection application similar to netstumbler (dstumbler) that
can be used to detect wireless access points and connected nodes, view
signal to noise graphs, and interactively scroll through scanned ap's
and view statistics for each. It also includes a couple other tools to
provide a complete toolset for making use of all 14 of the prism2
debug modes as well as do basic analysis of the hardware-based
link-layer protocols provided by prism2's monitor debug mode.
