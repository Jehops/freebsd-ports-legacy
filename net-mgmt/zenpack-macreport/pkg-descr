This ZenPack consists of a report for listing each MAC address and the Device 
and Interface it is associated with. This report makes use of the layer 2 
catalog already present in Zenoss. It only allows sorting by MAC address and is 
not exportable. The author made this decision because the processing time was 
too great for an installation with more than a few thousand interfaces. The 
author can make another one available that is exportable and sortable by the 
other two fields (device and interface), if anyone decides they would like to 
live through the painful wait time.
