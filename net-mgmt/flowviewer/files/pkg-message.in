    Alias /FlowViewer/ "%%FLOWVIEWERDIR%%/"


    <Directory "%%FLOWVIEWERDIR%%/">
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
        Order allow,deny
	Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
	Deny from all
    </Directory>

Then point your browser to 'http://myserver.domain.org/FlowViewer/FV.cgi'
