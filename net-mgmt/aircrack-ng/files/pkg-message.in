Due to the addition of virtual access points (VAP) in FreeBSD 8 you need to
create a new wlan device in monitor mode to use with airodump-ng. To do so,
issue the following command:
	ifconfig ${VAP_INTERFACE} create wlandev ${INTERFACE} wlanmode monitor

Then run airodump-ng(1) with the newly created interface ${VAP_INTERFACE}.
