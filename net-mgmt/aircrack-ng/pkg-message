======================================================================
Currently only airdecap-ng, packetforge-ng, aircrack-ng, ivstools and 
kstats can be compiled as aireplay-ng, airomon-ng and airodump-ng
are too Linux-specific to be built on FreeBSD.
However aircrack-ng can read  Kismet's dumpfile.

If you manage to patch the port so that the missing tools can be built
on FreeBSD, please contact the port maintainer.
