=== Configuration details ===
You can mostly follow the guide at:
http://observium.org/wiki/Installation

with the following notes:
- Installation directory is %%WWWDIR%%
- $config['fping'] should be set to '%%LOCALBASE%%/sbin/fping'
- The following lines should be added to /etc/crontab:

33	*/6	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PHP%% discovery.php -h all
*/5	*	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PHP%% discovery.php -h new
*/5	*	*	*	*	www	cd %%WWWDIR%% && %%PHP%% poller.php -h all

Notes:
- Setting $config['snmp']['internal'] to true is not recommended. The
  php function snmp_set_quick_print() used by Observium leaves units like
  kB in the value and Observium currently does not deal with that correctly.
