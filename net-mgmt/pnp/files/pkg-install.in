# I messed the proper way to create the configuration for PNP:
# config_local.php should be used for overrides and config.php
# will come modified at each upgrade.
#
# I was installing config.php as config.php-sample and hoping
# that people will use it as the base for original config.php.
#
# So, if we now have config.php at the installtion phase, then
# it means that config.php may be customized.  We save it as
# config.php.orig and informing the user about it.

======================================================================
WARNING:

You have config.php for PNP; this means that you are probably
upgrading from an old port version, where config.php-sample was
installed instead of config.php and it was meant that you will
cope with config.php yourself.

PNP's way to do the things is to let config.php be overwritten at each
upgrade and local overrides to it should go to config_local.php.

Your existing config.php was saved as config.php.orig, please, review
your modifications and put them to config_local.php.
