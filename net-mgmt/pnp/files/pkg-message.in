========================================================================

You just installed/upgraded PNP graphing tool for Nagios.

You will need to read the documentation at
  http://docs.pnp4nagios.org/pnp-0.6/doc_complete
both for new installations and upgrades from 0.4, since you will
need to tweak your Nagios and PNP configuration according to the
0.6.x recipes.

We recommend to start with the following restrictive Apache
configuration for the PNP area:
{{{
# PNP graphing tool
Alias %%PNP_URL%% %%WWWDIR%%
<Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/">
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
    Deny from all

    AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
    DirectoryIndex index.php

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /nagios/pnp/
    # Protect application and system files from being viewed
    RewriteRule ^(application|modules|system) - [F,L]
    # Allow any files or directories that exist to be displayed directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    # Rewrite all other URLs to index.php/URL
    RewriteRule .* index.php/$0 [PT,L]
</Directory>
}}}

Create %%WWWDIR%%/install.ignore to disable sanity check
and start using PNP.

Please, note that user who runs Apache processes should be able to
read PNP RRD spool files from
  %%PNP_RRDS%%
so you should tune path permissions accordingly.  Probably one could
start from adding Apache user to the group '%%NAGIOSGROUP%%'.

Remember to restart NPCD service after upgrade if you're using
'bulk' mode with NPCD.
