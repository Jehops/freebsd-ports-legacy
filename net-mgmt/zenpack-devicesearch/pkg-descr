This ZenPack provides the ability to quickly search for Devices by their name 
or by their IP address.  Search is triggered by typing 3 or more characters 
into the text box, which then returns the first 10 matches.  The use of the 
asterisk wild-card is supported, so you may search for fuzzy matches 
dynamically.
