ASpath-tree program
============================

ASpath-tree is a tool designed to be used by an IPv6 site involved
in the experimentation of the BGP4+ protocol inside the 6Bone network.
It generates summary of:

    * the number of route entries (valid/total/suppressed/damped/history)
    * the number of AS in table (total, originating only, originating/transit,
      transit only, private and reserved)
    * the number of active AS paths
    * the number of active BGP neighbours (i.e. announcing routing information)
    * an analysis of the network size, in terms of AS distances
    * the number of circulating prefixes (total, 6Bone pTLAs, sTLAs, 6to4,
      others)

The current version supports:
    * 6Bone pTLAs
    * RIR's assigned sTLAs
    * Juniper/Cisco/Zebra routers
