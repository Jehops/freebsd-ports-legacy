For the FreeBSD port, we assume:

%%PREFIX%%/mrourmon

is the base directory, although that can be overridden with
the port Makefile.

Read the INSTALL file in the ourmon base directory.
**************************************************

If you want to uninstall ourmon, read "uninstall.txt" in
the base directory.

Be sure and inspect and modify the basic config file,
at %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/etc/ourmon.conf.  In particular
set the notion of topn_syn home IP in the config file

topn_syn_homeip 10.2.3.4/32

to your home subnet and netmask.

After setting the config file up properly,
in order to start the front-end probe process,
named "ourmon", you must cd to the base directory
and run the ourmon probe from the start shellscript.

# cd %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/bin
# ./ourmon.sh start

If you use non-english language in console, set environment "LC_TIME" to "en_US"
before runnings scripts, for example:
############## ourmon crontab entries ###############
# run ourmon back-end omupdate.pl etc. per minute
*/1     *       *       *       *       root    (export LC_TIME=en_US; %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/bin/omupdate.sh)
# batchip.sh - hourly log summary
0       *       *       *       *       root    (export LC_TIME=en_US; %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/bin/batchip.sh)
# batchipall.sh - roll over daily summary logs at almost midnight
59      23      *       *       *       root    (export LC_TIME=en_US; %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/bin/batchipall.sh)
# daily.pl - re init next day logs at midnight
0       0       *       *       *       root    (export LC_TIME=en_US; %%PREFIX%/mrourmon/bin/daily.pl %%PREFIX%%/mrourmon/logs)
