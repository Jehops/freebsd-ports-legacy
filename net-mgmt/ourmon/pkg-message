For the FreeBSD port, we assume 

/usr/local/mrourmon 

is the base directory, although that can be overridden with
the port Makefile.

Read the INSTALL file in the ourmon base directory.
**************************************************

If you want to uninstall ourmon, read "uninstall.txt" in
the base directory. 

Be sure and inspect and modify the basic config file,
at /usr/local/mrourmon/etc/ourmon.conf.  In particular
set the notion of topn_syn home IP in the config file

topn_syn_homeip  10.1.0.0       255.255.0.0

to your home subnet and netmask.  

After setting the config file up properly,
in order to start the front-end probe process,
named "ourmon", you must cd to the base directory  
and run the ourmon probe from the start shellscript.

# cd /usr/local/mrourmon/bin
# ./ourmon.sh start
