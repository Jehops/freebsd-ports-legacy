Ourmon is a network management and anomaly detection system for
performing various SNMP RMON-like network analysis tasks.  It uses
the BSD bpf in combination with RRDTOOL as well as various "top
talker" style tuples including:  top-N flows which include IP, TCP,
UDP, and ICMP flows, top SYN senders, top TCP/UDP ports, top single
IP src to many IP dst senders, top single IP src to L4 (TCP/UDP),
top ICMP errors which includes UDP creators of ICMP errors and other
tools for both network management and anomaly detection.  RRDTOOL
graphs include a year of baselined information.  New RRDTOOL graphs
may be designed with user-configured BPF expressions a la tcpdump.
Reports and logging for top talkers are also included.
