TorK is a powerful anonymity manager for the KDE Desktop on Linux and Unix
systems. It first helps you to install, configure and use Tor. It then
reduces the task of anonymizing most applications to a single-click, including
Firefox, Opera, Konqueror, Pidgin, Kopete, SSH, and IRC. For advanced users
TorK provides detailed network information, and more, in an accessible manner.
