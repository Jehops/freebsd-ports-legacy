***********************************************************************

Please note that everything has been installed in %%PREFIX%%/www/fruity.

Create a database for fruity in MySQL with select,insert,drop,empty privileges.
Import the SQL data contained in %%PREFIX%%/www/fruity/sqldata/fruity-mysql.sql

create database fruity;
use mysql;
grant usage on fruity.* to fruity@localhost;
grant select,insert,drop on fruity.* to fruity@localhost;
set password for fruity@localhost = password('fruity');

Alter the database name, user name, and password to suit and set the same
values from above in the configuration file mentioned in the next paragraph.

Read %%PREFIX%%/www/fruity/INSTALL but keep in mind local changes for
FreeBSD: you need to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/fruity.config.inc-sample 
to %%PREFIX%%/etc/fruity.config.inc and modify appropriately.

You will probably want to add an alias to your httpd.conf file, something
like this:

   Alias /fruity/ /usr/local/etc/fruity/fruity/

And restart Apache.

Alternatively, you can create a host dedicated to fruity and use
a DocumentRoot of %%PREFIX%%/www/fruity.
