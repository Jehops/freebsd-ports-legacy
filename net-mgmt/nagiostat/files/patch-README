 **INSTALLING
-1. Unpack the tar-file to a directory, for example '/usr/local/nagios/nagiostat'. 
-The nagiostat-base-dir does not have to be within the nagios-installation directory.
 
-2. Start by editing the $BASE_DIR parameter in the file called "nagiostat", which is
-the main script. Set the value to the directory where you unpacked the files.
-Create a file called "debug.log" ('$ touch debug.log') in this dir and change permissions so that the
-nagios-user may write to it. This is the logfile for nagiostat which can be
-very helpful when debugging the regular-expression thing.

+The nagiostat-base-dir does not have to be within the nagios-installation
+directory.
 
-If things are installed in the directory specified in step 1, you can also run "make install" to
-create debug.log, archives-directory and set permissions on them. "make install" is under development.
-It also assumes that the nagios-user is called 'nagios'.

-You also have to make sure that the apache-user has read-rights to the RRDArchivePath

-this, password protecting for instance.
 
-5. Set up nagios to enable performance-data handling and that it should send the perfdata
-to nagiostat.
-In nagios.cfg, set the parameter 'process_performance_data=1'. This enables processing of
-performance data.
-Then add the parameter 'service_perfdata_command=service-perf-data-handler' also to nagios.cfg. This
-tells nagios to run the "service-perf-data-handler" command to process the performance data after
-each plugin has been executed.
