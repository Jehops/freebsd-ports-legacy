Mailman has been installed, but is not quite ready to be used yet!
You need to configure both Mailman and your MTA to integrate with each
other.  At the very least, you'll need to create these aliases:

  mailman: you@your.domain.com
  mailman-owner: mailman

You will also find README files with MTA-specific hints in
%%DOCSDIR%%.

You'll need to add at least the following to Apache's httpd.conf to
activate Mailman's web interface:

  ScriptAlias /mailman "%%MAILMANDIR%%/cgi-bin"
  Alias /pipermail "%%MAILMANDIR%%/archives/public"

Remember to reload your mail aliases if required, and to restart your httpd!

See %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL for further post-installation
instructions.

Note:  The entire Mailman installation resides under %%MAILMANDIR%%.
The command-line scripts necessary to administer Mailman have been installed
in %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin.
