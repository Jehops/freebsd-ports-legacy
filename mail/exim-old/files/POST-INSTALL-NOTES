To use Exim instead of sendmail:

*) Create exim/configure from exim/configure.default .
*) Clear the sendmail queue and stop the sendmail daemon.
*) Adjust mailer.conf(5) as appropriate.
*) Set the 'sendmail_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'NO'.
*) Set the 'daily_status_include_submit_mailq' periodic.conf(5) variable
   to 'NO'.
*) Start exim with '${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/exim.sh start'.

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

/var/log/exim/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
/var/log/exim/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
