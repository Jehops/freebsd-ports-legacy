+However, many clients require that the certificate presented by Exim be a user
+(also called "leaf" or "site") certificate, and not a self-signed certificate.
+In this case, the self-signed certificate described above must be installed on
+the client host as a trusted root certification authority and the certificate
+used by Exim must be a user certificate signed with that self-signed
+certificate.
