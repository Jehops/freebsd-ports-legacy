MIME::Types provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities to be determined and used programmatically.

This is based on Perl MIME::Types and reflects this heritage in the
existence of both MIME::Types and MIME::Type (which is the definition
of a single MIME type).  As with the Perl version, this module is
built to conform with MIME types in RFC 2045 and 2231.  This library
follows the collection of MIME types at the USC Information Sciences
Institute.
