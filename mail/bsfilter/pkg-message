Before actually using it, it is necessary to prepare a word database.

1.The word contained in clean mail is counted.
% bsfilter --add-clean ~/Maildir/.cur/*
 or
% ls ~/Maildir/cur/ | xargs bsfilter -c

2.The word in spam is counted.
% bsfilter --add-spam ~/Maildir/.spam/*
 or
% ls ~/Maildir/.spam/cur/ | xargs bsfilter -s

3.A database is updated for every word.
% bsfilter -u
