Turba is the Horde contact management application. It is currently in
the development stages, and makes heavy use of the Horde framework to
provide integration with other applications.

Right now, Turba is a fairly complete basic contact management
application. SQL and LDAP backends are available and fairly well tested.
You can define the fields in your addressbooks in a very flexible way,
just by changing the config files.
And there are Horde API functions to add and search for contacts.
