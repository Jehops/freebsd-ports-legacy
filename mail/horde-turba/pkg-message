Turba has been installed in %%TURBADIR%% with your blank

Horde must be configured; if not, see

Then, you will have to tune the configuration files located in

sources.php.

You have to create a table in your database; please see
%%TURBADIR%%/scripts/drivers.

If %%APACHE_CONF%% has been updated,
you have to restart Apache.
