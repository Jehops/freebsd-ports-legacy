Mutt -- "The Mongrel of Mail User Agents" (part Elm, part Pine, part mh,
part slrn, part everything else) is an interactive screen-oriented mailer
program that supersedes Elm, Pine, mail and mailx.

Features include color support, message threading, MIME support (including
RFC1522 support for encoded headers), customizable key bindings, POP3,
Delivery Status Notification (DSN) support, and PGP/MIME.

Warning, this is beta software.  While it is farily stable and quite
usable, core dumps do happen.  Use at your own risk.  New versions are
usually released every Friday.
