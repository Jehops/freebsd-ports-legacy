Dbmail is the name of a group of programs that enable the possiblilty
of storing and retrieving mail messages from a database (currently
MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite).

What are the advantages?

    * Scalability.
      Dbmail is as scalable as the database that is used for the
      mail storage.
    * Manageability.
      Dbmail is based upon a database. Dbmail can be managed by
      changing settings in the database (f.e. using PHP/Perl/SQL).
    * Speed.
      Dbmail uses very efficient, database specific queries for
      retrieving mail information. This is much faster then parsing
      a filesystem.
    * Security.
      Dbmail has got nothing to do with the filesystem or interaction
      with other programs in the Unix environment which need special
      permissions.  Dbmail is as secure as the database it's based
      upon.
    * Flexibility.
      Changes on a Dbmail system (adding of users, changing passwords
      etc.) are effective immediately.
