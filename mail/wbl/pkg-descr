wbl is a really simple tool that can be used in a .qmail file for managing
a white/black list of email addresses.  It only does one thing--it
checks for entries in ~/.wbl that it uses as a regex against the From:
field of an incoming email.  If it matches a line with a +, it forwards
the email to the white list, if it matches a line with a - it forwards
the email to the blacklist.
