*************
Configure postfix main.cf to check policy service before
other checks. They will be skipped on postpals matching.

Remember to put all relay checks first, so you don't 
create an open relay!

In %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/postfix/main.cf, integrate thusly: 

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
	...
	reject_unauth_destination
	...
	check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10040
	...
	(RBL, helo, PTR checks..)
