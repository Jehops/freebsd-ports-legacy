qar-bufo generates the Qmail assign and recipients file based on unix groups.

Unlike with qmail-pw2u, you don't need your users in /etc/passwd. They can be
stored any where that a NSS module allows.

Just make all users who send or recieve mail a member of a specific group, and
that group will be used to generate the assign and recipients file.
