IlohaMail (pronounced: e-lo-ha-mail) is a lightweight, yet full featured,
multilingual webmail program that is easy to use and install. It runs on a
stock, default build of PHP, and does not require databases (although
database support is available).  IlohaMail supports IMAP and POP3.

The devel branch is a rapidly moving target, and is not recommended for
deployment.
