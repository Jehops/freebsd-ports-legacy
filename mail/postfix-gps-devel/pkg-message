Configuration Instructions

You should now create a database for gps, and grant a dedicated database
user appropriate privilege to access it.  Please copy gps.conf-dist found
in your local etc directory to gps.conf and do some changes to reflect
the database and user.  gps will automatically create the tables that
is needed for greylisting.

After you have all these done, modify the postfix master.cf and include
gps as policy server.  We recommend that you use Unix domain socket
since this can be used even within a jail(8) environment.  An example
entry is:

policy	unix	-	n	n	-	-	spawn
	user=nobody	argv=%%PREFIX%%/libexec/gps -v %%PREFIX%%/etc/gps.conf

In order to make policy server effect on your postfix installation,
you should add something like:

	check_policy_service unix:private/policy

Into your smtpd_sender_restrictions configuration in postfix's main.cf.

Also, you may want to include the following line into your crontab so
system will automatically do daily cleanup of the greylist table:

27 * * * * %%PREFIX%%/libexec/gps-maintain.pl -delete -eq 0 -age 86400 %%PREFIX%%/etc/gps.conf
55 3 * * * %%PREFIX%%/libexec/gps-maintain.pl -delete -age 3110400 %%PREFIX%%/etc/gps.conf
