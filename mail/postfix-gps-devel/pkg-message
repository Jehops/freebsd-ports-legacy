Configuration Instructions

You need to create a database for greylisting manually, and a user for
this, too.  Additionally, please copy the gps.conf-dist found in your
local etc directory.

After you have all these done, modify the postfix master.cf and include
gps as policy server.

Also, you may want to include the following line into your crontab so
system will automatically do daily cleanup of the greylist table:

27 * * * * /usr/local/libexec/gps-maintain.pl -delete -eq 0 -age 86400 /usr/local/etc/gps.conf
55 3 * * * /usr/local/libexec/gps-maintain.pl -delete -age 3110400 /usr/local/etc/gps.conf
