To use RipMIME...

        If you have an MIME encoded archive (say from sendmail's output)
        called recvmail001.mime and you wish to unpack it to a directory
        (which already exists) called "/var/tmp/unpack", then use ripMIME
        as follows...

                ripmime -i recvmail001.mime -d /var/tmp/unpack
