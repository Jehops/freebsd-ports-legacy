This is a simple sendmail milter which adds an X-RBL-Warning header to
any  Xemails that are received that come from an open relay as
determined by your  Xchoice of RBL checking service (i.e.
bl.spamcop.net).

This is useful if you'd rather have the mail user agent (MUA) deal with
 Xpotential spam rather than just blocking it in case you loose
legitimate Xmessages.  Note that the X-RBL-Warning header is only set if
the site was Xfound to be an open-relay.
