JBossMail was created to enable JBoss to serve as an email server.

JBossMail currently consists of:

    * Core Server - which provides thread pooling, connection handling, and
      timeout configuration.
    * POP Protocol Implementation - plugs into the Server MBean to provide a
      POP implementation.
    * SMTP Server - plugs into the Server MBean to provide an SMTP protocol
      implementation.
    * Mail Listeners - plug into the SMTP server to forward mail to the various
      backends. Currently the JMSMailListener is provided. It forwards mails
      to various JBossMQ queues. Message Driven Beans for remote and local
      delivery are also provided.
    * Mailbox implementations - provides backends to the mail server. Presently
      an EJB Entity-based version is provided.
    * SMTPSender - uses JavaMail to mail messages to remote servers
    * Test suite - JUnit tests for the various portions of mail services.
      Includes a few services including mock-jndi.
