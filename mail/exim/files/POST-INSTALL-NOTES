Descriptions of new features not available it the manual, and a listing
of all changes, including bug fixes are documented in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/ChangeLog

To use Exim instead of sendmail on startup:

*) Clear the sendmail queue and stop the sendmail daemon.
*) Adjust mailer.conf(5) as appropriate.
*) Set the 'sendmail_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'NONE'.
*) Set the 'daily_status_include_submit_mailq' and
   'daily_clean_hoststat_enable' periodic.conf(5)
   variables to 'NO'.
*) Consider setting 'daily_queuerun_enable' and
   'daily_submit_queuerun' to "NO" in periodic.conf(5),
   if you intend to manage queue runners / deliveries closely.
*) Set the 'exim_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'YES'.
*) Start exim with '%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/exim start'.

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

%%LOGDIR%%/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 ZN
%%LOGDIR%%/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 ZN

NOTE TO OPERATORS UPGRADING FROM exim-3.xx:

There was a big reworking of the way mail routing works for release
4.00. Previously used "directors" were abolished, and all routing is
now done by routers. Policy controls for incoming mail are now done by
Access Control Lists instead of separate options. All this means that
pre-4.00 configuration files have to be massively converted. If you
are coming from a 3.xx release, please read the document in the file
%%DOCSDIR%%/Exim4.upgrade, and allow some time to complete
the upgrade.

Additional scripts to help upgrading are installed in:

  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%
