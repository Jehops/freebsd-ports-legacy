To run Exim instead of sendmail on startup:

1) Create exim/configure from exim/configure.default .
2) Stop the sendmail daemon.
3) Adjust mailer.conf(5) and set 'sendmail_enable' and 'sendmail_flags'
   as appropriate in rc.conf(5).
4) Start exim with appropriate command-line options.

However, if Exim is linked against 3rd-party libraries that are not in
the standard library search path (such as MySQL), then it should be
started with ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/exim.sh, after said library support is
enabled through its own startup script.  Alternatively, you can add
the library path of the problem package to ldconfig_paths in rc.conf(5).

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

/var/log/exim/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
/var/log/exim/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
