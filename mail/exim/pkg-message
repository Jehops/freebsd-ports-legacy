How to restore pre-4.77 behaviour of match_* expansions
=======================================================

Just two steps to do it:

 1. first, read README.UPDATING and in most cases you will
    realize that pre-4.77 behaviour is not what you want;

 2. if you're still here, turn on port's knob LISTMATCH_RHS
    and carefully review your configuration for untrusted
    right-hand sides in match_* operations.
