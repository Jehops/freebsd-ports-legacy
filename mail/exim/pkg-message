How to restore pre-4.77 behaviour of match_* expansions
=======================================================

Just two steps to do it:

 1. first, read README.UPDATING and in most cases you will
    realize that pre-4.77 behaviour is not what you want;

 2. if you're still here, turn on port's knob LISTMATCH_RHS
    and carefully review your configuration for untrusted
    right-hand sides in match_* operations.


Upgrades to Exim 4.80
=====================

Exim 4.80 contains some backward-incompatible changes.

OpenSSL default options have changed to be more secure, including
disabling of SSLv2 by default (and adding support for TLSv1.1 and
TLSv1.2 if using OpenSSL 1.0.1 or newer); GnuTLS has been updated to use
a new API and stop honouring some options starting gnutls_*; users of
LDAP can now distinguish "comma in data" from "multi-valued attribute".
There are more details, covering more changes, in README.UPDATING.

We now enable accept_8bitmime by default, as the Exim maintainers agree
with Dan Bernstein about the best way to deal with the 8BITMIME
extension.
