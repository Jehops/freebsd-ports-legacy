MessageWall is a free software SMTP proxy. It sits between the outside 
world and your mail server and keeps out viruses, spam and mail relaying. 
Unlike many existing ISP-level filtering solutions, it offers 
customization of filtering features on a per-address basis. MessageWall 
employs a scoring system that allows message rejection based on multiple 
rules with different weigths, and header tagging when the message doesn't 
reach the threshold.
