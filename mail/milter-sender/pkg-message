In order to run this port, please add the following line to
/etc/mail/YOUR-CONF.mc:

include(`milter-sender.mc')dnl

Don't forget to remake and reinstall the sendmail configuration file
after modifying YOUR-CONF.mc.

IMPORTANT NOTE for those updating from older releases:

The default cachefile format has changed from bdb to flatfile, because
the author has observed instabilities and cache corruption problems in
milter-sender with the version of BerkeleyDB used in base FreeBSD.

So, if one has observed such behaviour before, or just for the sake
of stability, he should change the CacheType= setting to flatfile in
milter-sender.cf and move the old cache file away.

A new solution to the problem exists, which may or may not serve better.
One may build a BerkeleyDB v.2+ -enabled Sendmail (mail/sendmail port
has now got knobs for it). This way is, of course, a bit more tricky,
as in the very minimum one should also rebuild this port with
corresponding BDB settings (see Makefile), may be a couple of other
programs that use sendmail databases, and rebuild the very databases.
