************************************************************************

In order to run this port, please add the following line to
/etc/mail/YOUR-CONF.mc:

include(`milter-sender.mc')dnl

Don't forget to remake and reinstall the sendmail configuration file
after modifying YOUR-CONF.mc.

IMPORTANT NOTE for those updating from older releases:

The default cachefile format has changed from bdb to flatfile, because
the author has observed instabilities and cache corruption problems in
milter-sender with the version of BerkeleyDB used in base FreeBSD.

So, if one has observed such behaviour before, or just for the sake
of stability, he should change the CacheType= setting to flatfile in
milter-sender.cf and move the old cache file away.
