This is a small, efficient clamav content filter for Postfix. What is does
is just a content filtering of messages passing via Postfix MTA thru clamav.

This version will fork and run clamdscan binary. Next version will connect
to clamd directly via libclamav.

Clamfilter was designed to be the only content filter in Postfix installation,
and this is why this software appeared. All other content filters for Postfix
are designed to be flexible; clamfilter is not. It is just designed to perform
a single task - filtering thru clamav.
