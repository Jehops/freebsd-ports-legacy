	See %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/MailScanner/README.FreeBSD.port,
	http://www.mailscanner.info, the man pages MailScanner and
	MailScanner.conf for further instructions.

	You will need to make several modifications to config files
	before MailScanner will work correctly.
                                              
	If this is the first time you are installing this port you
	should create an initial set of configuration files with 
                                                               
	make initial-config 

	within this directory. Without this step you will only have
	.sample files instead of real .conf files and report
	templates.

	If you are upgrading your port you might consider 
	running

	make renew-wrapper
	make renew-autoupdate
	make renew-reports

	to update your virus-wrappers, autoupdates, reports and
	languages.conf

	The english languages.conf is updated automatically. For all
	other versions use the update_languages_conf tool found
	in the work directory of this port.

	Sophos users: Please take a look at the Sophos install
	script %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/MailScanner/Sophos.install.freebsd

	Please also always look at the port changelog at
	%%PREFIX%%/share/doc/MailScanner/CHANGES.port

       ************************************************************
       Some users have reported problems with this port and a
       previously upgraded port of perl (5.8.8 > 5.8.9). Please
       ensure you are taking the correct steps when upgrading perl
       as described in /usr/ports/UPDATING. If you are still
       having problems, many people have had success by upgrading
       to perl 5.10 instead.
