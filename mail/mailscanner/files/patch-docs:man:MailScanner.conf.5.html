+<p>Do you want to check for &quot;Phishing&quot; attacks?
+These are attacks that look like a genuine email message
+from your bank, which contain a link to click on to take you
+to the web site where you will be asked to type in personal
+information such as your account number or credit card
+details. Except it is not the real bank&rsquo;s web site at
+all, it is a very good copy of it run by thieves who want to
+steal your personal information or credit card details.
+These can be spotted because the real address of the link in
+the message is not the same as the text that appears to be
+the link. Note: This does cause significant extra load,
+particularly on systems receiving lots of spam such as
+secondary MX hosts. This *cannot* be the filename of a
