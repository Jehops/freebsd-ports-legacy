 The maximum size, in bytes, of any attachment in a message. If this is set to zero, effectively no attachments are allowed. If this is set less than zero, then no size checking is done. This can also be the filename of a ruleset, so you can have different settings for different users. You might want to set this quite small for large mailing lists so they don't get deluged by large attachments.

+The maximum depth to which zip archives will be unpacked to allow for checking filenames and filetypes within zip archives. Setting this to 0 will disable filename/\-type checks within zip files while still allowing to block password protected zip files.

-Strings listed here will be searched for in the output of the virus scanners. It works to achieve the opposite effect of the "Silent Viruses" listed above. If a string here is found in the output of the virus scanners, then the message will be treated as if it were not infected with a "Silent Virus". If a message is detected as both a silent virus and a non\-forging virus, then the non\-forging status will override the silent status. In simple terms, you should list virus names (or parts of them) that you know do *not* forge the From address. A good example of this is a document macro virus or a Joke program.
