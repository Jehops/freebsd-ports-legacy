+The per\-user files (bayes, auto\-whitelist, user_prefs) are looked for here and in ~/.spamassassin/. Note the files are mutable. If this is unset then no extra places are searched for. NOTE: SpamAssassin is always called from MailScanner as the same user, and that is the "Run As" user specified in MailScanner.conf. So you can only have 1 set of "per\-user" files, it's just that you might possibly need to modify this location. You should not normally need to set this at all.
