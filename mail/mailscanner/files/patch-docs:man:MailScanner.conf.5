 Should we use a TNEF decoder (external or Perl module)? This should be "yes" unless the scanner you are using (Sophos, McAfee) has the facility built\-in. However, if you set it to "no", then the filenames within the TNEF attachment will not be checked against the filename rules.

+When the TNEF (winmail.dat) attachments are expanded, should the attachments contained in there be added to the list of attachments in the message?

 While detecting "Phishing" attacks, do you also want to point out links to numeric IP addresses. Genuine links to totally numeric IP addresses are very rare, so this option is set to "yes" by default. If a numeric IP address is found in a link, the same phishing warning message is used as in the Find Phishing Fraud option above. This value cannot be the name of a ruleset, only a simple yes or no.

+\fBUse Stricter Phishing Net\fR
+Default: yes
+.br

+.br 
+If this is set to yes, then most of the URL in a link must match the destination address it claims to take you to. This is the default as it is a much stronger test and is very hard to maliciously avoid. If this is set to no, then just the company name and country (and any names between the two, dependent on the specific country) must match. This is not as strict as it will not protect you against internal malicious sites based within the company being abused. For example, it would not find www.nasty.company\-name.co.uk pretending to be www.nice.company\-name.co.uk. But it will still detect most phishing attacks of the type www.nasty.co.jp versus www.nice.co.jp. Depending on the country code it knows how many levels of domain need to be checked. This can also be the filename of a ruleset.

 The value of the option is actually never used, but it is evaluated at the end of processing a batch of messages. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a Custom Function.
