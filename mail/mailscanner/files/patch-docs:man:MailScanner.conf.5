+Default: no
+.br 
+A few viruses store their infected data in UU\-encoded files, to try to catch out virus scanners. This rarely succeeds at all. Setting this option to yes means that you can apply filename and filetype checks to the contents of UU\-encoded files. This may occasionally be  useful, in which case you should set to yes. This can also be the filename of a ruleset.

 The value of the option is actually never used, but it is evaluated at the end of processing a batch of messages. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a Custom Function. The Custom Function should then be written to have a "side effect" of doing something useful such as logging lots of information about the batch of messages to a file or an SQL database.

+This option is intended for people who want to log per\-batch information. This is evaluated after the "Always Looked Up Last" configuration option for each message in the batch. This is looked up once for the entire batch. Its value is completely ignored, it is purely there to have side effects. If you want to use it, read CustomConfig.pm.
