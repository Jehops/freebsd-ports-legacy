+Do you want to check for "Phishing" attacks? These are attacks that look like a genuine email message from your bank, which contain a link to click on to take you to the web site where you will be asked to type in personal information such as your account number or credit card details. Except it is not the real bank's web site at all, it is a very good copy of it run by thieves who want to steal your personal information or credit card details. These can be spotted because the real address of the link in the message is not the same as the text that appears to be the link. Note: This does cause significant extra load, particularly on systems       receiving lots of spam such as secondary MX hosts. This *cannot* be the filename of a ruleset, it must be 'yes' or 'no'.

NOTE: SpamAssassin is always called from MailScanner as the same user, and that is the "Run As" user specified in MailScanner.conf.
