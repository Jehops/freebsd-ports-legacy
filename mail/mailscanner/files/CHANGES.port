Version 4.50.15_1
=================
- The MailScanner binary is now put into /usr/local/sbin allowing for
  easy use of the command-line options for debugging etc.
- From this version on all ports will contain this Change Log.
- The following scripts are now installed by the port as well (into
  /usr/local/libexec/MailScanner):
	- analyse_SpamAssassin_cache
	- clean.SA.cache (use this for manual clean or in crontab)
	- clean.quarantine (use this for manual clean or in crontab)
	- update_phishing_sites (use this for manual updates)
	- update_phishing_sites.cron (use this in crontab)
	- update_virus_scanners.cron (ise this in crontab)
- The latter two can/should be used in your crontab for updating those
  components. These scripts introduce a random delay for updating (can
  be configured in rc.conf).
- Fixed a small bug in mailscanner.sh script. Status/Stop was not
  always working.

Version 4.50.15
===============
- Upgrade to MailScanner 4.50.15-1
- Start/Stop scripts are now rc.subr compliant. Please adjust your config!
- The port now optionally installs Spamassassin, ClamAV and Bitdefender.
- make renew-wrapper, renew-autoupdate and renew-reports now depend on 
  configure instead of on install allowing their usage after a portupgrade.
