Archmbox is a simple email archiver written in perl: 
- parses one or more mailboxes
- selects some or all messages 
- performs specific actions on the selected messages.
At this time archmbox supports mbox and mbx mailbox formats.
 
Three different modes are available: 
- list mode, which is useful to list all selected messages  
- kill mode, if messages should be deleted from the mailbox(es) 
- archive mode, to archive the selected messages in a different mailbox 

Messages selection is based upon:
- date criteria
- absolute date 
- days offset 

It is also possible to refine the selection using regex on the header fields.
The archive mailbox can be saved in gz or bz2 compressed format as well.
