Prom-Mew is a procmail reader for Mew on GNU Emacs.

If you want to install quickly, you shoud do following steps:

(1) add dot.emacs to your ~/.emacs file and change it suitable for your site

  % cat /usr/local/share/examples/prom-mew/dot.emacs >> ~/.emacs
  % vi ~/.emacs

(2) copy dot.procmailrc to ~/.procmailrc and change it suitable for your site

  % cp /usr/local/share/examples/prom-mew/dot.promailrc ~/.promailrc
  % vi ~/.promailrc

(3) byte-compile with "byte-comile" script if you want

  # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
  # /usr/local/share/doc/prom-mew/byte_compile -l mew xemacs-mule prom-mew

Where detail specification for .emacs and .procmailrc may be shown in

search unread mails from procmail log to show unread message from top of
entries that you specfied in ~/.pronmailrc.
