%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% See %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/sqlite/README

%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% You'll always want to run dspam_clean -p0 and 
%%SQLITE%% sqlite /path/to/user.sdb < vacuum after a corpusfeed.
%%SQLITE%% where /path/to/user.sdb would by on a default install: 
%%SQLITE%% %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/dspam/data/user/user.sdb
%%SQLITE%% There are  most likely 70%+ junk tokens that need to be removed.
%%SQLITE%% This will have a HUGE impact on the disk space your db uses.
