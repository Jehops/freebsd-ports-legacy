 See the file %%DOCSDIR%%/README for advice about 
 how to configure DSPAM and
 %%DOCSDIR%%/README.your_mta_name 
 for MTA or pop3 integration; examples for:
 courier, exim, pop3filter, postfix, qmail and sendmail.
 Keep in mind that while this port obeys our hier(7) this thing is not
 reflected in distributed files because I lack the time for patching them.
