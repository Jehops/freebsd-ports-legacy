This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading dspam port.  I will try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time before attempting any port upgrade.

This file concetrate on the FreeBSD / port specific changes and one should read
also the UPGRADING enclosed in the dspam distribution. You can see it by doing
in the port directory:
make extract;  more `find . -type f -maxdepth 2 -name UPGRADING`

# dspam-devel-3.3.0.a.20041201.1330
#

Say hello to the daemonized dspam! Enable it at compile-time with DAEMON option.

- it speaks LMTP:
LHLO
MAIL FROM: [password]@[server id]
RCPT TO: [list of DSPAM users] [DSPAM parameters] [delivery agent parameters]
DATA
[message]
.

- daemon processes *and* delivers at the moment (including to stdout).
- For client-side delivery, use --stdout and configure your MTA to deliver.
- it may be necessary to perform all delivery in the client, as using fork &&
  pipe in a MT app may be bad
- implemented multiple responses per recipient
- changed storage driver layer to use a driver context (for caching connections)
- stateful db connections done for mysql driver
- to do next: client

- remember that all this is experimental and it may change at any time.

- fix PREX_EXT and BDB4 handling in the port Makefile to really enable them.

# dspam-devel-3.3.0.a.20041125.0945
#

- changed the naming scheme because of to many upstream modification in 
tarball naming - right now it lacks any version (for the same reason the 
distfile is renamed from snapshot.tar.gz to PKGNAME and sits on my server); 
\ it is now made up of:
PORTNAME:		dspam-devel
next MINOR_VERSION:	3.3.0
we're in pre-beta:	a
SNAPSHOT_DATE:		20041125.0945
\ the strange ``a'' is necessary for pkg_version to work correctly when we will
have the 3.3.0 beta's, rc's and release (tested with pkg_version -t)

- follow the update procedure from the entry bellow

- there is a new and very useful dspam.conf option:
 MaxMessageSize - specify a maximum message size to process
\ I suggest setting it somewhere between 100 and 300 KB, it is unlikely the
spam you are receiving is bigger and this will improve performance as big
messages won't stuck the databese 

- tum mode has been enhanced and it should outperform teft

To upgrade you should:

0. Read docs enclosed with teh dpsam distribution, beginnig with UPGRADING and
README

1. Adjust your OPTIONs
( make rmconfig config in dspam port dir, command line, pkg_tools.conf )

2. make VARs.......
in dspam port dir with appropiate OPTIONS adn VARs (see changes above)

3. stop you MTA or deactivate dspam from it

5. make VARs........ install

4.a) If using MySQL 4.0.xx or PostgreSQL:
- back-up the database
- use the appropiate migration script from files dir of dspam port dir
(if using MySQL 4.1.x or 3.xx you're on your own for now)

5. Back-up and them move the files from the old DSPAM_HOME 
(defaulted: /usr/loca/etc/dspam) to the new DSPAM_HOME (default /vad/db/dspam) 
or where ever you defined DSPA_HOME in 2 above.

6. Adjust you new dspam.conf according with your setup OPTIONS and VARs defined
on make / mak install step.

7. Remove the old setup files (you have them in the back-up, right ?)

7. Enable dspam in the MTA setup, but only locally or something and start testing.

If something ain't working is one of:
- permissions problems (hint: with what UID 
is dspam called from your MTA vs. DSPAM_HOME and DSPAM_LOG_DIR)
- something wrong in dspam.conf (hint: you didn't remove old config files 
and they are still used ?)
