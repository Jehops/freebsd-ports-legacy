IMP 3 is currently in heavy development. Features that have been added
include searching; a new, flexible preferences system; a hierarchical
folder tree; and more.

It requires PHP4. You should use it if you want to take advantage of
PHP4s built-in session handling and improved speed; if you want access
to features such as the interactive spell checker and folder searching;
or if you want to contribute a major piece to the code.

This code branch continues the trend of 2.2 by being slimmer, cleaner,
and better designed code than the previous version.
