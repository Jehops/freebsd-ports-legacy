Post-Install Notes for Majordomo
================================

Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps
manually:

	- customize 'majordomo.cf' in your majordomo directory

	- look at 'aliases.majordomo' in your majordomo directory for examples
	  of how to create lists.  A test list (test-l) has been created and
	  configured for you.  Be sure to remove this list if you do not
	  want to use it for testing.

	- substitute your own email address for "Postmaster" for the
	  "majordomo-owner" alias.

	- add 'aliases.majordomo' to your sendmail configuration.  This can
	  be done by adding a line similar to the following to 
	  /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  OA/usr/local/majordomo/aliases.majordomo
	  (for 8.6.x Sendmail)
	  
	  O AliasFile=/etc/aliases,/usr/local/majordomo/aliases.majordomo
	  (for 8.7.x and up)

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file :

	  define(`ALIAS_FILE',/etc/aliases,/usr/local/majordomo/aliases.majordomo')

	- consider using ports/mail/tlb to process your deliveries if you
	  want to hide your outgoing aliases.  This way you can prevent people
	  from evading restrictions for posting to your lists.

	- the user executing the commands of your local aliases must be added
	  to your majordom group to be able to execute the setuid wrapper
	  script. Sendmail does this as daemon by default, which is already
	  added. The postfix port uses nobody by default, which should be
	  changed to another user if your users can execute commands as user
	  nobody (Apache/CGI comes to mind). Postfix does not do initgroups()
	  properly, so you need to chgrp the wrapper script to the
	  default_privs user (this may apply for other MTAs as well) for it
	  to work. It is important that you do this and not just make wrapper
	  executable for all; you are increasing the chances of it getting
	  exploited if you do.

Enjoy Majordomo!
