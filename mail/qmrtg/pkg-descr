Qmrtg is a free tool to help monitoring the activity of a qmail mailserver.
It's intended to be used with MRTG.

Qmrtg is modular. Each module carries out a different log analysis. 
A super-module lets the user easily request any analysis without to
know anything about the modules themselves.
Qmrtg has been originally written for qmail, but most of its modules
work with every software logging with multilog (see 'daemontools').

Qmrtg is an alternative to qmailmrtg7.
