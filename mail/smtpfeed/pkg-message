**************************************************************
smtpfeed is installed into /usr/local/libexec/smtpfeed.
You'll need to perform 3 steps, (a) to (c), to make smtpfeed
work:
	(a) replace /etc/sendmail.cf
	(b) replace sendmail with the patched sendmail
	(c) setting up /etc/syslog.conf

(a) depends on what kind of configuration tool you are using
with sendmail.cf.  Read through documentation in
/usr/local/share/doc/smtpfeed for details.
(b) can be done by performing "make install-sendmail" in the
port directory.
WARNING: Existing sendmail will be overwritten right away!
Backup by yourself for safety.
(c) is the easiest of the three items; see file named INSTALL
in /usr/local/share/doc/smtpfeed.
