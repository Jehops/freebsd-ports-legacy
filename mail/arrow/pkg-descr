Arrow provides a powerful, intuitive interface to electronic mail.
The ability to automatically monitor an unlimited number of inboxes
fed by a procmail script and to rearrange messages and even move
them to different mailboxes by simply dragging them significantly
eases the burden on managing one's daily correspondence.

It is a free e-mail program that was written to address the e-mail needs
of users migrating from Win95 and the Macintosh to Linux. It currently
supports viewing, composing, and organizing of e-mail, including secure
e-mail via PGP, POP access,  and a spell checker.
