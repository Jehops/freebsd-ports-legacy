NOTE: If you wish to make easier use of the rlytest program from within
scripts, you might want to modify the exit codes it uses.  Line 122 of
the script contains the exit code used if the relay was accepted (bad),
and line 165 contains the exit code used if the relay was rejected
(good).  The original author has expressed a wish that his code not be
modified automatically in this way by this distribution, but if you wish
to modify your local copy, you should feel free to do so.

If you just change the "0" line line 122 to a "1", then in shell scripts
you'll be able to use constructs like:

  if /usr/local/bin/rlytest $hostname >/dev/null 2>/dev/null ; then
    echo "$hostname is good"
  else
    echo "$hostname is evil"
  fi
