The rlytest utility tests a host to determine whether it will relay
third-party email.  It will try to relay an email message to yourself
through that host.  A host that allows third-party relay is subject to
attack by Internet vandals, and frequently is hijacked by spammers to
relay massive amounts of junk email.  A host that allows third-party
relay should IMMEDIATELY be secured, disconnected, or shunned as a
menace to the Internet.
