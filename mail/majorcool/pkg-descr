MajorCool is a CGI script written in Perl that provides a Web interface
to Majordomo. It is intended to run co-located with the Majordomo
program (ie, both mail and Web on the same host).

MajorCool was originally designed as an administrative front-end to the
popular mailing list manager, allowing novice list-owners to manage
their list configuration and subscriber base.
