ATTENTION:

The default location of the whitelist files has changed from
%%PREFIX%%/etc/postfix to %%ETCDIR%%.  If you modified the
whitelists, you will need to either move them to the new location or
specify their location by adding --whitelist-clients and
--whitelist-recipients parameters to postgrey_options in /etc/rc.conf.
