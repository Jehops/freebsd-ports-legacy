To run Exim instead of sendmail on startup:

1) Create exim/configure from exim/configure.default .
2) Stop the sendmail daemon.
3) Adjust mailer.conf(5) and set 'sendmail_enable' and 'sendmail_flags'
   as appropriate in rc.conf(5).
4) Start exim with appropriate command-line options.

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

/var/log/exim/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
/var/log/exim/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
