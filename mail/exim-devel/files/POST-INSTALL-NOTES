To use Exim instead of sendmail on startup:

*) Create exim/configure from exim/configure.default .
*) Clear the sendmail queue and stop the sendmail daemon.
*) Adjust mailer.conf(5) as appropriate.
*) Set the 'sendmail_enable' rc.conf(5) variable to 'NO'.
*) Set the 'daily_status_include_submit_mailq' periodic.conf(5) variable
   to 'NO'.
*) Start exim with '${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/exim.sh start'.

You may also want to configure newsyslog(8) to rotate Exim log files:

/var/log/exim/mainlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z
/var/log/exim/rejectlog	mailnull:mail 640 7 * @T00 Z

NOTE TO OPERATORS UPGRADING FROM exim-3.xx:

There was a big reworking of the way mail routing works for release
4.00. Previously used "directors" were abolished, and all routing is
now done by routers. Policy controls for incoming mail are now done by
Access Control Lists instead of separate options. All this means that
pre-4.00 configuration files have to be massively converted. If you
are coming from a 3.xx release, please read the document in the file
${PREFIX}/share/doc/exim/Exim4.upgrade, and allow some time to complete
the upgrade.
