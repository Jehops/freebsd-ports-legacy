 If more messages are found in the queue than this, then switch to an "accelerated" mode of processing messages. This will cause it to stop scanning messages in strict date order, but in the order it finds them in the queue. If your queue is bigger than this size a lot of the time, then some messages could be greatly delayed. So treat this option as "in emergency only".
