+You can use this ruleset to enable the "bounce" Spam Action. You must *only* enable this for mail from sites with which you have agreed to bounce possible spam. Use it on low\-scoring spam only (<10) and only to your regular customers for use in the rare case that a message is mis\-tagged as spam when it shouldn't have been. Beware that many sites will automatically delete the bounce messages created by using this option unless you have agreed this with them in advance.
