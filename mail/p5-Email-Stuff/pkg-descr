Email::Stuff, as its name suggests, is a fairly casual module
used to email "stuff" to people using the most common methods.
It is a high-level module designed for ease of use when doing
a very specific common task, but implemented on top of the
tight and correct Email:: modules.

Email::Stuff is typically used to build emails and send them
in a single statement, as seen in the synopsis. And it is
certain only for use when creating and sending emails. As such,
it contains no email parsing capability, and little to no
modification support.
