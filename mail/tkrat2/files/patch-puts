This file fixes the pkgIndex.tcl generating code. If the pkgIndex.tcl
is generated properly, the bug is never triggered, which is why this
went unnoticed for so long. But there is no ``outs'' command in Tcl --
this resulted in a double error, and you were not be able to see why
the pkgIndex generation failed.
