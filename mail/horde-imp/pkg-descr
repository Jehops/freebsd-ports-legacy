Note: this port is mostly for sites running PHP3.
      For a new installation, please consider the port mail/imp3.

IMP is a set of PHP3 scripts that implement an IMAP based webmail system.
Assuming you have an account on a server that supports IMAP, you can use
an installation of IMP to check your mail from anywhere that you have web
access.
