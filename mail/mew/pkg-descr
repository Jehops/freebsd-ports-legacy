Mew is a "Message interface to Emacs Window" to integrate

   - Email
   - NetNews
   - MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
   - PGP(Pretty Good Privacy)

and to make it easy to view and compose them. With Mew you can send a
picture of a birthday cake with the song "Happy Birthday to you" to your
friend, which is encrypted by strong cryptograph.

Info path and elisp load path would be set as follows :

    Info path - /usr/local/info
    load path - /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mew

You must be setting your own environment:

    1st -   Set up "~/.im/Config" correctly (execute imsetup)
    2nd -   Set up "~/.emacs" correctly
 
(See info by C-h i and  selecting   "Mew", "Install" and "User" ).

Sample files for those above are in /usr/local/share/examples/mew.

Most easy going way to install user environment is to execute
/usr/local/share/examples/mew/user-install on your home directory. You can
easily set up your mail environment interactively. 

If you have installed correctly, type "M-x mew", then you can see Mew
greeting messages and little while later ready to use. Enjoy!
