   - electronic mail
   - NetNews
   - MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
   - PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail)
   - PGP(Pretty Good Privacy)

and to make it easy to view and compose them. With Mew you can send a
picture of a birthday cake with the song "Happy Birthday to you" to your
friend, which is encrypted by strong cryptograph.

    Info path - /usr/local/info
    load path - /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mew

You must be setting your own environment:

    1st -   Do "inc" in your home directory
    2nd -   Set up "~/.mh_profile" correctry
    3rd -   make "~/Mail/scan.form" correctry
    4th -   make directory "~/Mail/drafts"
    5th -   Set up "~/.emacs" correctry
