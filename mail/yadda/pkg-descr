Yadda - Yet Another Damn Delivery Agent is a
fully featured mail delivery agent, with support for Maildir++
and softquotas. It also supports filtering, and SQL-usage.
It's written entirely in Perl and uses Mail::Audit which is
available from CPAN. It's compatible with RFC2033 (LMTP) 
and works great with postfix, and other LHLO/LMTP-fluent MTA's.
