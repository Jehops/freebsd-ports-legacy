In order to activate spamass-milter, follow these steps:

1. Review and customize your system-wide SpamAssassin preference, by
   editing /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  Refer to the SpamAssassin
   manpage Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf(3) for details on what to put in it.

2. If you didn't activate spamd (the SpamAssassin daemon), do so now:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/spamd.sh start

3. Activate spamass-milter:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/spamass-milter.sh start

4. Backup your sendmail.cf (in /etc/mail).

5. If you didn't create your own customized version of Sendmail .mc
   file, create one from the default template (replace YOURNAME with a
   suitable name; a good candidate is the output of `hostname -s'):

	cd /etc/mail
	cp -p freebsd.mc YOURNAME.mc
	echo "SENDMAIL_MC = /etc/mail/YOURNAME.mc" >> /etc/make.conf

   The last line tells the system to use your customized version instead
   of the default freebsd.mc when you run mergemaster(8) later on.

6. Add the spamass-milter hook to your Sendmail .mc file.  The magic
   line to add is:

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spamassassin', `S=local:/var/run/spamass-milter.sock, F=, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')

   Everything should go on a single line, no line break/continuation is
   allowed!

   The best place to add this is right after the dnsbl-related comments.
   (Hint: Every comment in an .mc file starts with `dnl'.)

7. Rebuild the sendmail.cf from your .mc file:

	cd /etc/mail
	make
	make install

   Or you can run mergemaster(8) instead if you want, although it's an
   overkill.

8. Restart Sendmail:

	kill -HUP `head -1 /var/run/sendmail.pid`

9. Test the whole piece:

	/usr/sbin/sendmail root < /usr/local/share/doc/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin/sample-nonspam.txt
	/usr/sbin/sendmail root < /usr/local/share/doc/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin/sample-spam.txt

   Each of these commands might take a long time to finish (up to about
   10-20 seconds), so please be patient.

   You should receive two messages, one from `Keith Dawson' and the
   other from xl6Ety00V@fismat1.fcfm.buap.mx.  The one from Keith Dawson
   shouldn't be tagged as a spam, bearing this header line:

	X-Spam-Status: No, ...

   On the other hand, the one from xl6Ety00V@fismat1.fcfm.buap.mx should
   be tagged as a spam, bearing these two header lines:

	X-Spam-Status: Yes, ...
	X-Spam-Flag: YES

   If things don't work as expected, promptly restore your sendmail.cf
   from the backup copy then restart sendmail as shown on step 8; you
   may lose incoming mail otherwise!


Now all messages received by Sendmail are filtered through
SpamAssassin, and probable spam messages are tagged with the header
`X-Spam-Flag: YES'.  Tell your users about this so they can set up
appropriate filters on their mail reader.
