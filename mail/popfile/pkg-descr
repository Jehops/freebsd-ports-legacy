POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up and
trained, it will scan all email as it arrives and classify it based on your
training. You can give it a simple job, like separating out junk e-mail, or
a complicated one -- like filing mail into a dozen folders. Think of it as a
personal assistant for your inbox. 

Before using this ports, use ${LOCALDIR}/share/popfile/popfile-setup.sh
script to create _your_ own popfile instance.

For 'Nihongo' users: this ports also imports the bugfix of Japanese
character parsing, versioned as 0.20.1.1.
