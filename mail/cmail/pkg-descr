cmail is a simple mail counting tool written in perl. It reads in a config
fileXand returns which mailfiles contain mail, how much mail, and how many 
new messages. Example of output -
            Personal mail    1 message
                 JLC mail   20 messages (2 new)
                EXPI mail    2 messages
                  DWC RPG    1 message

This may be useful if you split your mail into multiple files using something
like procmail. I'm not sure if the new/old mail determination works with
anything other than mutt.
