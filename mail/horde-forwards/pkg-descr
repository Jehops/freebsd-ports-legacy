Forwards is a Horde module for setting user email forwards via the .forward
mechanism supported by several popular mailers.

Right now, Forwards provides fairly complete support for setting .forward style
forwards on Sendmail, Courier, or Qmail mail based systems via an FTP transport.
It now also has drivers for Mdaemon, Exim SQL, Exim LDAP, Custom SQL, and SOAP
based systems.
