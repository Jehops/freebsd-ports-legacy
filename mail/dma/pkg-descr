The DragonFly Mail Agent is a small Mail Transport Agent (MTA),
designed for home and office use.  It accepts mails from locally
installed Mail User Agents (MUA) and delivers the mails either
locally or to a remote destination.  Remote delivery includes
several features like TLS/SSL support and SMTP authentication.

Since dma is not intended as a replacement for real, big MTAs
like sendmail(8) or postfix(1), it does not listen on port 25
for incoming connections.
