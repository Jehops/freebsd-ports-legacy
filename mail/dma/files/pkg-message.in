To enable dma please edit /etc/mail/mailer.conf to replace all lines
referring to another MTA with the following:

sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/libexec/dma
send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/libexec/dma

If you need sendmail -t compatibility, e.g. for send-pr(1), you may use the
ruby wrapper script instead (make sure to install lang/ruby as well):

sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/libexec/dma.rb
send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/libexec/dma.rb

Note that the ruby wrapper only supports a subset of what is considered valid
email address syntax by the relevant RFCs.

If you not need sendmail anymore, please add in your rc.conf:

sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

And you can disable some sendmail specific daily maintenance routines in your
/etc/periodic.conf file:

daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"
