	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read /var/qmail/doc/PORT_NOTES.
It contains important information about testing and configuring
qmail, and finally replacing sendmail with qmail.

You should also add /var/qmail/man to your MANPATH (see manpath(1)
or login.conf(5)).

You can enable qmail as your default mailer:

# this will disable the default MTA
1) do "make disable-sendmail"

# enable qmail as your default MTA
2) do "make enable-qmail"
