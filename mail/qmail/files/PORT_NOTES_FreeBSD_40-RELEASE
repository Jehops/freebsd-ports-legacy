In addition to PORT_NOTES_FreeBSD_40-RELEASE, there are many
other potentially important qmail documents there such as PORT_NOTES
and INSTALL.

As with all ports, the ports maintainer (me!) makes NO WARRANTIES of
any kind: expressed, implied, or other; about the reliability or
security of this package.  Any damage or problems derived from its
usage or related to it are neither my responsibility nor the software
author's.  This package is provided AS IS.

Although I am probably sounding cold and harsh, believe me: qmail is
one of the most reliable and easy-to-use softwares around.  However,
this also is NOT a WARRANTY.  It is just an opinion.  :)

The qmail port will normally install into /var/qmail/.  If you changed
this to /usr/local/, then please note that the docs have been
installed into /usr/local/share/doc/qmail/ (as opposed to
/usr/local/doc/).

If you read PORT_NOTES, you may have noticed I mentioned step 12 should
be changed for FreeBSD versions 4.0-Release and later.

FreeBSD 4.0-Release and later come with a program named mailwrapper (8)
which eases the replacement of sendmail. No binaries need to be touched,
"chmod"ed, erased, deleted or, otherwise, modified.

Whenever you call /usr/sbin/sendmail, /usr/bin/mail, or /usr/bin/newaliases;
in fact, you are calling a symbolic link to mailwrapper. Mailwrapper
then calls the appropriate binary according to its configuration file.

An excerpt from the mailwrapper manual: 

"The mailwrapper program is designed to replace /usr/sbin/sendmail and to
 invoke an appropriate MTA instead of sendmail(8) based on configuration
 information placed in /etc/mail/mailer.conf. This permits the administra-
 tor to configure which MTA is to be invoked on the system at run time."

Configuration for mailwrapper is kept in /etc/mail/mailer.conf.

Here follows my personal /etc/mail/mailer.conf

sendmail        /var/qmail/bin/sendmail
send-mail       /var/qmail/bin/sendmail
mailq           /var/qmail/bin/qmail-qread
newaliases      /var/qmail/bin/newaliases

There is a sample mailer.conf in this directory, please install
over the /etc/mail/mailer.conf to unfold qmail as your default MTA.
Please don´t forget to backup /etc/mail/mailer.conf before doing
so. Better safe then sorry.

So, whenever you call sendmail, in fact, you are using the appropriate
"qmail-clones".

You should notice, though, that the programs do not behave exactly as
their sendmail counterparts. Therefore, reading the appropriate
/var/qmail/doc files and man pages is highly advisable.
