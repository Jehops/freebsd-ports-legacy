ATTENTION!!!

For qmail-scanner work correctly, be sure to have QMAILQUEUE patch applied on
your qmail.

Please, configure correctly your anti-virus and anti-spam. You
HAVE to reinstall this port each time you add or remove an 
Anti-Virus or Anti-Spam;

Now configure the environment variable to use qmail-scanner:

You just need to add for your tcpserver file (generally called
as: tcp.smtp):

QMAILQUEUE="%%PREFIX%%/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl"

Or create an new file in /service/smtpd/env, with the following
content and called as "QMAILQUEUE":

%%PREFIX%%/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl

NOTE: always you change anything in your environment dir, you just
need to restart your smtpd, for it use: "svc -k /service/smtpd".

You can test your installation by running 'make test' in port dir.

Remember to rename quarantine-events.txt.sample in /var/spool/qscand 
and then run "qmail-scanner-queue.pl -g" to generate DB version. 

Please log into an unpriviledged account and run 

%%PREFIX%%/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl -g
