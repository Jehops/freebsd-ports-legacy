Qmail-Scanner is an add-on that enables a Qmail email server to scan gatewayed
email for certain characteristics (i.e. a content scanner). It is typically used
for its anti-virus and anti-spam protection functions, in which case it is used
in conjunction with external scanners.

It also enables a site (at a server/site level) to create "Policy blocks":
i.e. react to email that contains specific strings in particular headers, or
particular attachment filenames or types (e.g. *.VBS attachments).
