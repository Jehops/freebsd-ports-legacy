---- From README (slightly modified) ---

youbin is a kind of biff in the network age. When youbin is used, the
mail spool of a certain, specific machine (mail server) is observed to
inform the arrival of mail to a user at an arbitrary machine through
the network.  On the other hands, the conventional "biff" informs only
the user who logs in at the machine on which the mail spool
resides. Combining with POP, youbin eliminates a lot of NFS mount of
mail spool directory caused by checking mail arrival.

Since youbin is designed with event driven, the user is promptly
informed of status change of mail spool caused by arrival of new
message and/or reading messages.
