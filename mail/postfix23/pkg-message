If you have postfix configured in your /etc/mail/mailer.conf (answered yes to
the previous question) and would like to enable postfix to start at boot time,
please set these variables in your /etc/rc.conf file:

sendmail_enable="YES"
sendmail_flags="-bd"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

This will disable Sendmail completely.


Also, you may wish to disable some Sendmail-specific daily maintenance
routines in your /etc/periodic.conf file:

daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"                                      
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"


If you are using SASL, you need to make sure that postfix has access to read
the sasldb file.  This is accomplished by adding postfix to group cyrus and
making the /usr/local/etc/sasldb* file(s) owned by group cyrus.
