POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR ATMAIL
=====================================

1) Before the post-install of atmail, please make sure
   your SMTP server work well first.
   Better turn off magic_quotes_gpc setting in php.ini.

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /atmail %%WWWDIR%%
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

3) Visit your atmail site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/atmail/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up atmail.
