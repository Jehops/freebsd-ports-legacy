Pine for FreeBSD 2.x is a tool for reading, sending, and managing
electronic messages.  It was designed specifically with novice
computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the needs
of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols (e.g.
RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix and PCs.  This
package also includes the Pico editor and the IMAP daemon.
