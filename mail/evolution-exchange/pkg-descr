Ximian Connector is a plugin for Evolution that adds Exchange client
capabilities to Evolution.

With the Evolution Connector installed, Evolution functions as an
Exchange client, enabling users to become full participants in company-wide
group scheduling and other collaborative tasks. Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD
users can access public folders, Global Address Lists, email, calendar,
task lists, and group scheduling information.
