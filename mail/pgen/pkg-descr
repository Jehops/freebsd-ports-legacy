pgen is a little tool that uses m4(1) and some macros to help build
and maintain a procmailrc file. It can make life much simpler than
having to remember how procmail recipes work each time you subscribe
to a new mailing list.

It won't help you maintain the worlds most complex procmailrc file,
but for simple cases, it can make life a lot more convenient (and
amenable to further postprocessing).
