IMAPFilter is an IMAP mail filtering utility, which based on user defined
rules, processes mail residing in IMAP mailboxes without downloading them.
Available searching criteria, which can be combined using logical operators
(and/or/not), include the matching of a string in the headers or body of
messages, the size, date or status of them.  Different actions can be applied
such as deletion, copying or moving of messages to mailboxes in the same or
different mail server, and changing of their flags.

IMAPFilter additionally supports connection encryption through either imaps SSL
wrapped session or the IMAP STARTTLS extension and user authentication using
the CRAM-MD5 mechanism.  Other features also include encryption and secure
storing in the filesystem of the user's passwords, running in daemon mode,
support for the IMAP NAMESPACE extension.

IMAPfilter is purposed as a preconnect utility before a user fetches his/her
mail, accesses his/her mailboxes with one of the available mail user agents or
browses them via the Web.
