IMAPFilter is an IMAP mail filtering utility, which based on user defined
rules, processes mail residing in IMAP mailboxes without downloading them.
Available searching criteria, which can be combined using logical operators
(and/or/not), include the matching of a string in the headers or body of
messages, the size, date or status of them.  Different actions can be applied
such as deletion, copying or moving of messages to mailboxes in the same
or different mail server, and changing of their flags.  Other features also
include daemon mode and encryption and secure storing in the filesystem of the
user's passwords, using the integrated interactive password editor.

IMAPfilter is purposed as a preconnect utility before a user fetches his/her
mail, accesses his/her mailboxes with one of the available mail user agents or
browses them via the Web.
