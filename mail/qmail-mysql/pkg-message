	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read /var/qmail/doc/PORT_NOTES.
It contains important information about testing and configuring
qmail, and finally replacing sendmail with qmail.

You should also add /var/qmail/man to your MANPATH (see manpath(1)
or login.conf(5)).

Do not forget to read http://iain.cx/unix/qmail/mysql.php. After all,
this is NOT our old stock qmail.

You can enable qmail as your default mailer executing:
> /var/qmail/scripts/enable-qmail
