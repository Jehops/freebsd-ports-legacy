This is a POP 3 server useful for dealing with remote mail reader clients
such as Eudora.  One of the 4.1a2 patches has been included so that
home-dir-misc actually works.  The option and patch for IPv6 have been removed
as it they are not up to date for 4.0.9.

Don't forget to edit /etc/inetd.conf to enable the server after installation.
