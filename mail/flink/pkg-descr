The Flink mailchecker is a small panelapplet that supports multiple 
accounts, so that you will not need to have several applets for 
checking different accounts, Flink is capable to have (almost) an 
infinite amount of accounts configured.
Flink supports POP3, IMAPv4 and mbox right now. Support for other 
types of mailaccounts will be added in time, or if you bug me 
enough about it.
Flink is released under the GPL license.
