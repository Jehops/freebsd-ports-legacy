 Reporting problems, asking questions:
 - FreeBSD specific port-related problems/questions/patches: maintainer
(and ports@ if you feel the need); send-pr only if you get no timely reply
 - dspam specific questions: dspam/dspam-dev mailing list (maintainer cc'ed)
 - dspam specific patches: dspam/dspam-dev mailing list (maintainer cc'ed)
 Please be sure to include in your email/pr relevant information such as:
 uname -a, dspam --version, %%_VAR_DIR%%/db/ports/%%PORTNAME%%/options, MTA setup.

Asking about updates or telling me there is one: not only I am active on the
mailing lists and IRC but I also track dspam CVS so I already know; either there
is a problem with the new version or I didn't have enough time to patch the port
and _test_ the new version; please report your success/failure if you run the
new version or the cvs version.
