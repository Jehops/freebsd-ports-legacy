 See the file %%DOCSDIR%%/README for advice about 
 how to configure DSPAM and
 %%DOCSDIR%%/README.your_mta_name 
 for MTA or pop3 integration; examples for:
 courier, exim, pop3filter, postfix, qmail and sendmail.
 Keep in mind that while this port obeys our hier(7) this thing is not
 reflected in distributed files because I lack the time for patching them.

%%MYSQL%%
%%MYSQL%% See %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/mysql/README
%%MYSQL%% for instructions on how to configure DSPAM - MySQL interaction.
%%MYSQL%%
%%MYSQL%% BACKUP FIRST !!!
%%MYSQL%%
%%MYSQL%% To modify a 2.x database use and use it with dspam 3.x use:
%%MYSQL%% %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/mysql/2x_to_3x_db.sql
%%MYSQL%% To modify a 3.1.0  *mysql4.0* use :
%%MYSQL%% %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/mysql/310_to_320.my.sql
%%MYSQL%%
%%PGSQL%%
%%PGSQL%% See %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/pgsql/README

%%PGSQL%% for use with DSPAM.
%%PGSQL%% 
%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% See %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/sqlite/README
%%SQLITE%% for suggestion on SQLite back-end. It should work out-of-the-box.
%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% You'll always want to run dspam_clean -p0 and 
%%SQLITE%% sqlite %%DSPAM_HOME%%/data/user/user.sdb < vacuum 
%%SQLITE%% after a corpusfeed.
%%SQLITE%% There are  most likely 70%+ junk tokens that need to be removed.
%%SQLITE%% This will have a HUGE impact on the disk space your db uses.
