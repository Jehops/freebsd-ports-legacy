This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading dspam port.  I will try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time before attempting any port upgrade.

This file concetrate on the FreeBSD / port specific changes and one should read
also the UPGRADING enclosed in the dspam distribution. You can see it by doing
in the port directory:
make extract;  more `find . -type f -maxdepth 2 -name UPGRADING`

To upgrade you should:

0. Read docs enclosed with teh dpsam distribution, beginnig with UPGRADING and
README

1. Adjust your OPTIONs
( make rmconfig config in dspam port dir, command line, pkg_tools.conf )

2. make VARs.......
in dspam port dir with appropiate OPTIONS and VARs (see changes above)

3. stop you MTA or deactivate dspam from it

5. make VARs........ install

4.a) If using MySQL 4.0.xx or PostgreSQL:
- back-up the database
- use the appropiate migration scripts from files dir of dspam port dir
( for MySQL you should use 2x_to_3x_db.sql then 310_to_320.my.sql)
(if using MySQL 4.1.x or 3.xx you're on your own for now; the same for 
PostgreSQL, but take a look in the UPDATING and 310_to_320.pg.sql)

5. Back-up and them move the files from the old DSPAM_HOME 
(defaulted: /usr/loca/etc/dspam) to the new DSPAM_HOME (default /var/db/dspam) 
or where ever you defined DSPAM_HOME in 2 above.

6. Adjust you new dspam.conf according with your setup OPTIONS and VARs defined
on make / mak install step.

7. Remove the old setup files (you have them in the back-up, right ?)

8. Enable dspam in the MTA setup, but only locally or something and start testing.

If something ain't working is one of:
- permissions problems (hint: with what UID 
is dspam called from your MTA vs. DSPAM_HOME and DSPAM_LOG_DIR)
- something wrong in dspam.conf (hint: you didn't remove old config files 
and they are still used ?)
