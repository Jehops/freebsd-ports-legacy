1. Edit your /etc/inetd.conf to use popa3d. The line should look like this:

pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/libexec/popa3d   popa3d

Note: when started via an inetd clone, the logging of connections is left
up to that inetd clone or TCP wrappers.

2. Restart inetd by sending it a SIGHUP:

# killall -HUP inetd
