If you are upgrading, you may need to update your current installation's
database.  You can do so by browsing to [URL]/setup.php where [URL] is the
postfixadmin root.

To avoid checksum errors when removing or upgrading postfixadmin, do not
edit config.inc.php.  Instead, put your configuration settings in
config.local.php in the postfixadmin webroot.  That file will be included
automatically by config.inc.php.

For detailed information, please see the complete installation steps in
%%DATADIR%%/INSTALL.TXT.

See %%DATADIR%%/CHANGELOG.TXT for any upgrade-related details, including
configuration changes.
