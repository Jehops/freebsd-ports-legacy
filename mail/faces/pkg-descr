This is the fourth general release of a "faces" server for monitoring a
list visually. Typically this is a list of incoming mail messages.

Faces has three different modes of operation:

 (a) The default will monitor for new mail. By default, only the last ten
     messages are displayed.

 (b) You can monitor the whole of a mail file. The open window will
     automatically adjust it's size to correctly show the face icons.

 (c) Custom monitoring. You can specify a program or shell script to run.

     There are lots of good examples that have already been written and
     these can be downloaded from:
     ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/faces/picons/src/

Included with this release, is the ability to include a face image with
your mail message using an X-Face header line (plus continuation lines).
Faces expects this line to be in a certain compressed format, and
uncompresses it, and displays that image on-the-fly.

Audio capabilities are also provided as a conditional compilation option.
