MAIL_GID|26|The group id under which your MTA performs mail delivery
	Getting the value of MAIL_GID right is crucial to getting Mailman to
	work with your MTA.  By default this port works with sendmail.  If
	you're using an alternative MTA installed from ports, you should set
	MAIL_GID at build time according to the following table.  (Please
	contact this port's maintainer if you can fill in the blanks, or to
	report mistakes!)

	Qmail   | ???      |
CGI_GID|80|The group id under which your web server executes CGI scripts
	By default, this port works with the current port of Apache.  If your
	WWW server executes CGI scripts under a different GID, you'll have to
	set this at build time.
