Mailman has been installed, but is not quite ready to be used yet!
You need to configure both Mailman and your MTA to integrate with each
other.  At the very least, you'll have to create some aliases.

See %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL for post-installation instructions,
with "prefix" being "%%MAILMANDIR%%".  You may also find README
files with MTA-specific hints in %%DOCSDIR%%.

The entire Mailman installation resides under %%MAILMANDIR%%.
The command-line scripts necessary to administer Mailman have been
installed in %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin.

You'll need to add at least the following to Apache's httpd.conf to
activate Mailman's web interface.  (Remember to restart your httpd!)

  ScriptAlias /mailman/ "%%MAILMANDIR%%/cgi-bin/"
  Alias /pipermail/ "%%MAILMANDIR%%/archives/public/"
