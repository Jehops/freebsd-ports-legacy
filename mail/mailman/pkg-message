Mailman has been installed, but requires further configuration before use!

You will have to configure both your MTA (mail server) and web server to
integrate with Mailman.  If the port's documentation has been installed,
extensive post-installation instructions may be found in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/FreeBSD-post-install-notes

Note (1):  If you use an alternate (non-Sendmail) MTA, you MUST be sure
that the correct value of MAIL_GID was used when this port or package
was built.  Performing a "make options" in the Mailman port directory
will list required values for various mail servers.

Note (2):  The entire Mailman installation resides under %%MAILMANDIR%%
The command-line scripts necessary to administer Mailman have been
installed in %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin

Note (3):  As of version 2.1, Mailman's queue runner runs as a daemon and
is started by a script in %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d
