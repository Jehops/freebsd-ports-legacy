A mail reader for gnome. It supports local mail, pop3, and IMAP. It can
view mail files in mbox, maildir, and mh format. However, MIME is not
working yet and you cannot use attachments.

The pop3 support is not complete. All mail retrieved will be left on the
server, and hence retrieved again if not deleted through some other pop3
client. I would recommend using fetchmail to retrieve pop3 mail.
