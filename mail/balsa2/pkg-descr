A mail reader for GNOME 2. It supports local mail, pop3, and IMAP. It can
view mail files in mbox, maildir, and mh format.

The pop3 support is not complete. All mail retrieved will be left on the
server, and hence retrieved again if not deleted through some other pop3
client. Using fetchmail would be recommended to retrieve pop3 mail.

Balsa is probably not fully usable as one's primary mail client at this
time.  However, it is under active development and fits with other gnome
applications.
