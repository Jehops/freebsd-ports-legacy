Please note that to automatically replace the existing MTA, use the port 
framework of this package:
	
	cd @PORTSDIR@/mail/zmailer && make replace

This will prepare ZMailer for initial configuration and replace your existing 
transport agent. If you do not wish to replace your mailer, but only wish to
prepare ZMailer for operation, use the provided post-install script as 
follows:

	sh @PREFIX@/sbin/post-install

This will initialize your configuration files and build an initial policy
database.

Also please note that a "make world" will sever the proper links for 
/usr/sbin/sendmail, /usr/bin/mailq and the likes. If you wish to not build 
sendmail as part of a "make world", add NO_SENDMAIL to the build environment. 
You may do this in /etc/make.conf.
