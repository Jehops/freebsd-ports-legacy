Enigmail is an extension to the Thunderbird / Seamonkey mail client
which allows users to access the authentication and encryption features
provided by the popular GnuPG software.

Enigmail can encrypt/sign mail when sending, and also decrypt/authenticate
received mail. It can also import/export public keys. Enigmail supports
both the inline PGP format, and the PGP/MIME format (RFC 3156), which can
be used to encrypt attachments.
