This is a sendmail filter, based on Milter API, intedned to do spam 
control and canceling it. This is multi-thread small filter, which 
sits between sendmail and local mail agent, checks all mail by 
selected rules and cancels spam-qualified messages.

Main features:
- Charset controlling. No more unreadable mails in your box!
  You can selectively setup, which codepages for which users are 
  allowed, mail with other codepages will declined
- HTML isolating. You can setup filter to check all incoming, outgoing 
  or all (or none) mail to HTML mail and decline it.
  IMHO, HTML mail is a headache only. You can separately setup on 
  per-user basis, which users can send HTML mail, which can receive
- Attachment control. You can allow or deny receiving mail with attachments,
  sending mail with attachments and send and receive simultaneously
- 'Shadow watch'. You can silently keep copy of outgoing mail from local 
  users to further analysis. Watch incoming mail will be arrived shortly.

Any other features (content filtering, attachment checking) are
planned, but not imlemented this release.
