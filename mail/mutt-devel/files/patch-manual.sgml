 This is not a real menu, but is used as a fallback for all of the other
 menus except for the pager and editor modes.  If a key is not defined in
 another menu, Mutt will look for a binding to use in this menu.  This allows
 you to bind a key to a certain function in multiple menus instead of having
 multiple bind statements to accomplish the same task.
-<tag/alias
+<tag/alias/
 The alias menu is the list of your personal aliases as defined in your
 muttrc.  It is the mapping from a short alias name to the full email
 address(es) of the recipient(s).
-<tag/attach

 The attachment menu is used to access the attachments on received messages.
