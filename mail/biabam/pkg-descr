Biabam Is A Bash Attachment Mailer

To use BIABAM use the following syntax (yes, it is on my todo list, to add
switches so the syntax get's like mailing with commandline Mutt):

echo <body> | biabam <attachment> -s <subject> <recipient>

Example:
echo "Here is the tarball you requested" | \
  biabam foobar-0.7.8.tar.gz -s "Answer to your request" john@doe.org

If no text is piped into biabam, it will wait for text on standard input
(finish with CTRL-D)

BIABAM also works with the Bourne shell (/bin/sh).
