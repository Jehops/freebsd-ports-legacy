NOTE: This port is deprecated as of 9/1/2009.
The Hotmail and Windows Live servers no longer support DAV, so hotwayd can
no longer work with those services. Fortunately the servers now support POP3
directly (via POP3+SSL at pop3.live.com:995) so hotwayd is not needed.

Hotwayd uses HTTPMail (the same protocol that Outlook Express used) to access
servers such as Hotmail.  The software acts as a proxy mail server, allowing
you to access e-mail on Hotmail and similar servers using standard POP3 mail
clients.
