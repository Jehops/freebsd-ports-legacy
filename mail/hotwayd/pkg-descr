Hotwayd uses HTTPMail (the same protocol that Outlook Express uses) to access
servers such as Hotmail.  The software acts as a proxy mail server, allowing
you to access e-mail on Hotmail and similar servers using standard POP3 mail
clients.

Starting with version 0.8, the port also includes hotsmtpd which can be used
for sending e-mail through Hotmail and similar servers with standard SMTP
mail clients.
