********************
hotwayd should normally be run from inetd (or xinetd).
To use the standard ports for pop3 and smtp, add lines
like the following to /etc/inetd.conf:

pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd

Alternatively, you may specify an arbitrary port for hotwayd.
Define them in /etc/services, and then add a line like the following to
/etc/inetd.conf:

hotwayd	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd

After making your changes, restart inetd. e.g.:

killall -HUP inetd

You can now use fetchmail or any pop3 mail client to receive your
hotmail (or similar) e-mail. The username should be your full e-mail
address (e.g. example@hotmail.com), and the password is your your
password for hotmail (or whichever service you use).

For more detailed information see hotwayd(1) and the port
documentation in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/hotwayd.
