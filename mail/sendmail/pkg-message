---------------------------------------------------
If you update your configuration from 8.11.x you need to install an
additional config file: /etc/mail/submit.cf, you can generate it
by calling the target 'submit.cf', submit.mc will be installed too.
$ make submit.cf

you should add in /etc/make.conf:
SENDMAIL_CF_DIR=	%%PREFIX%%/share/sendmail/cf

To active the delivery from the local submission queue see:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sm-client.sh.sample

To deliver all local mail to your mailhub, edit the last line of submit.mc:
FEATURE(`msp','mailhub.do.main`)dnl

and set your flags in /etc/rc.conf:
sendmail_flags="-L sm-msp-queue -Ac -q1m"

You can delete /etc/mail/sendmail.cf when you don't need a daemon listen.
To update your configuration look at %%PREFIX%%/share/sendmail/cf/README.
---------------------------------------------------
To activate sendmail as your default mailer, call the target 'mailer.conf':
$ make mailer.conf

Your '/etc/mail/mailer.conf' should look like this:
#
# Execute the "real" sendmail program, named /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
#
sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/sendmail
send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/sendmail
mailq		%%PREFIX%%/sbin/sendmail
newaliases	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/sendmail

You may also need to update /etc/rc.conf.
