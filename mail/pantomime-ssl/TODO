       3.1 How do I get SSL working?
(Linux/MacOS X) [ Linux ]
You need to install OpenSSL. This library is available in packages for most distributions. As an example, under Debian/Linux, you can do:

% apt-get install libssl-dev

and all the prerequisites will be installed.
Once you have installed OpenSSL, simply compile the TCPSSLConnection by doing:

% cd Pantomime/Bundles/SSL; make; make install


[ MacOS X]
Under Apple Mac OS X, the SSL code was developped and tested using the OpenSSL package from the Fink project. You first need to install Fink, following their instructions. Once you've installed Fink, you can install OpenSSL by doing:

% apt-get install openssl-dev

Once you have installed the OpenSSL package, you can open the Pantomime project inside Project Builder. Compile Pantomime using the default target first and once it has completed, select the TCPSSLConnection target and build this target. Once you've sucessfully build it, copy the TCPSSLConnection bundle to your user's library directory by doing:

% mkdir ~/Library/Pantomime; cd Pantomime/build; cp -R TCPSSLConnection.bundl ~/Library/Pantomime
