Some files you might need to customize include the following:

    ${PKG_PREFIX}/etc/nmh/mhn.defaults - For example, you may
        want to adjust the programs used to handle various MIME
        content types.

    ${PKG_PREFIX}/etc/nmh/mts.conf - For example, you may need
        to adjust the "servers" setting if you don't have a
        locally installed sendmail (or other MTA).
