# @(#)conf/EDITME-dist	1.50 9/10/92 01:07:17
#
# EDITME - edit me to perform high level configuration of smail
#
# The EDITME file is used by makefiles to build individual defs.h,
# defs.sh and defs.sed files, which in turn control the build/install
# process of smail.
#
# The EDITME-dist file servers as a reference copy only.  Patches to
# smail will refer to EDITME-dist rather than EDITME.  Only the EDITME
# file is used in the build/install process.  Any editing should be done
# to the file EDITME, which should be located in the same directory as
# EDITME-dist.
#
# The EDITME is a /bin/sh shell script.  That is, comments begin with
# the first non-quoted/non-escaped '#' character.  Values are set
# using NAME=VALUE or NAME=, with no spaces around the equal sign.
# Values that have spaces or special shell characters should be
# qouted and/or escaped.  Consult the sh(1) man page for further details.
#
# Values that are indicated as optional may, in some cases, not be set.
# All other values MUST be set to some value.  The NAME= form is
# equivalent to not setting the value, with the exception of TEST_BASE.
#
# An alternate path to the EDITME file can be specified through setting
# the environment variable SMAIL_EDITME.  This can either be a full
# pathname or a relateive pathname, which will be referenced relative
# to the smail conf directory.  Care must be taken with dependencies in
# makefiles when the path to the EDITME file has changed.  If this is
# a permanent change, then type "make depend" at the top of the smail
# source tree.  Otherwise the conf/lib/mkdefs.sh shell script can be
# run in affected directories to create new defs files.


# CFLAGS - the base set of flags for the cc command
#
# optional
#
# When debugging smail, it is useful to set this to "-g".  Otherwise
# "-O" is normally used to optimize the code produced.
#
# NOTE:  I get core dumps on SCO MPX 2.0 when using the bind router (I
#   haven't tried other SCO releases).  Whatever the problem is, it
#   goes away when I compile without -O.  If anybody finds the cause,
#   please let me know.  For now, if you get core dumps when using the
#   bind router on SCO, try compiling without -O.

CFLAGS=-O				# common

# CC - the C compiler to use for compiling smail
#
# optional (defaults to cc)
#
# CAUTION: gcc does not work with smail on all architecures.  In
# particular, problems have been reported on the SunOS platform.  The
# typical problem is that gcc uses different structure-passing
# conventions for function calls.  This is a problem for a few
# networking calls which pass around in_addr structures.
#
# Some conf/os files set an alternate default value for CC.  In
# particular, the SunOS CC defaults to /bin/cc, to ensure that
# /usr/sys5/cc is not used.

#CC=gcc					# use the GNU C Compiler


# LDFLAGS - flags to pass to the loader
#
# optional
#
# These flags are passed to the cc command before any object
# modules or libraries.

#LDFLAGS=-L/usr/ucblib			# use an alternate directory for libs
#LDFLAGS="-L/usr/ucblib -Bstatic"	# and don't use shared libraries


# LIBS - libraries to include in binaries
#
# optional
#
# These libraries are passed to the cc command before any libraries
# mentioned in the conf/os file.  It can be used to link in additional
# libraries before the system libraries.
#
# If you wish to use the GNU dbm library, then add -lgdbm to LIBS
# (perhaps with a -L to indicate the directory containing gdbm),
# and then add NDBM to the HAVE variable.

#LIBS=-lgdbm				# use the GNU dbm library
#LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lgdbm"		# if gdbm is in /usr/local/lib
#LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lgdbm -lalloca" # load alloca function from somewhere


# OSLIBS - ending libraries to include in binaries
#
# optional
#
# These libraries are passed to the cc command after all other
# libraries from any other source.  For example, this can be used
# to force the use of an alternate C library, or a shared version
# of the C library.
#
# Some conf/os files already specify use of the shared C library, and
# some necessary system libraries.

#OSLIBS=-lc_s				# SVR3 shared C library
#OSLIBS="-lc_s -lcposix"		# POSIX and shared C libs


# STRIP - define this if you wish to strip binaries when installing
#
# optional
#
# The smail binaries will only be striped on installation if STRIP=yes.
# This may save some disk space at the expence of the ability to do
# symbolic debugging.

STRIP=yes


# USE_SYMLINKS - define this if you wish to use symlinks when installing
#
# optional
#
# The smail binaries are normally installed using hardlinks between
# the various copies of the smail binary.  Where hardlinks cannot be
# made, real copies are made.  To use symbolic links instead of
# hard links and copies, set USE_SYMLINKS=yes.  This will cause only
# one copy of the smail binary to be installed.  Do not define this
# if your system does not have symbolic links.

USE_SYMLINKS=yes


# OS_TYPE - define the operating system type for your machine
#
# required
#
# Consult the conf/os directory for a complete list of recognized
# operating system types.  The names given below may not represent
# all of the operating systems for which an OS description file
# is available.

#OS_TYPE=aix3.1				# IBM AIX 3.1

#OS_TYPE=mips-bsd4.3			# MIPS Risc/OS in bsd universe
#OS_TYPE=3b2-s5.3+win			# 3b2 with SVR3.2 and WIN TCP/IP


# ARCH_TYPE - architecture type
#
# required
#
# The ARCH_TYPE of 16bit refers to machines with 16 bit words.  This
# mode is untested.  It is assumed that 16bit machines have extended
# address spaces as smail is more than 64k bytes long.

ARCH_TYPE=32bit					# common
#ARCH_TYPE=small32bit				# 32 bit without reasonable VM
#ARCH_TYPE=16bit				# untested


# DRIVER_CONFIGURATION - configuration file describing smail drivers
#
# optional
#
# By default, the os configuration file (conf/os/OS_TYPE) refers to
# the file that describes the available director, router and transport
# drivers.
#
# For example on BSD-based OS_TYPEs, the os configuration file refers to
# a driver configuration that uses BSD networking.  A BSD based system
# could not set DRIVER_CONFIGURATION and get the BSD netwokring based
# drivers; or a system could set DRIVER_CONFIGURATION=unix-generic and
# disable BSD networking drivers.
#
# Currently few conf/os files specify the arpa-network driver
# configuration (which includes support for the BIND server).
# If you want to use this, you must usually set DRIVER_CONFIGURATION
# explicitly.  You may also have to add BIND to the HAVE list (later
# in this file) to use the arpa-network driver configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR INTERNET HOSTS
#
# NOTE: The bind router driver is not configured into the compiled-in
# routers, so you will need to install a routers file to use it.  Get
# a routers file from samples/generic/routers and copy it to
# /usr/lib/smail.  Comment out the first version of inet_hosts from
# that file, and uncomment the second (the bind version) of the
# router.  You may also want to uncomment the forcepaths router, if
# you forward for any hosts in the UUCP zone.

#DRIVER_CONFIGURATION=unix-generic		# no BSD networking
#DRIVER_CONFIGURATION=$ROOT/mydriver.cf		# customized configuration
#DRIVER_CONFIGURATION=arpa-network		# include bind router


# LMAIL - where the real /bin/mail resides
#
# optional
#
# On many System V machines, the /bin/mail program will deliver what 
# it thinks is local mail directly into user mailboxes, and may also
# call uucp, or some other remote delivery mechanism.  The /bin/mail
# program will therefore can bypass smail.
#
# A solution to this program is to move the /bin/mail supplied with
# your system to another name, LMAIL, and to then install the binmail
# program, in pd/binmail as /bin/mail.  If binmail is invoked to read
# mail, the LMAIL (old /bin/mail) is called, otherwise SMAIL is called
# to deliver mail.
#
# If LMAIL is defined below and the specified file does not exist,
# then the binmail makefile install rule will attempt to move
# /bin/mail to LMAIL and then copy binmail into /bin/mail.  If LMAIL
# is defined and the file LMAIL does exist, then the binmail
# makefile will refuse to install binmail.
#
# If LMAIL is not defined then /bin/mail is not touched.
#
# NOTE: due to potential problems or confusion with binmail
#	installation, binmail is not automatically built and installed
#	from higher level makefiles.  One must go to the pd/binmail
#	directory and "make install" explicitly.

#LMAIL=/bin/lmail				# standard System V


# MISC_DEFINES - miscellaneous definitions
#
# optional
#
# A colon-separated list that names miscellaneous macros to define
# for C programs and shell scripts.  Each entry in the list can be
# a simple name, or the name can be followed by an equal sign to
# provide a value.  For example:
#
#	MISC_DEFINES="void=int:DECLARE_UTIMBUF:NO_FORWARDTO_FILE"
#
# Defines void to be int for compilers that do not correctly support
# the void type, and declares the macro DECLARE_UTIMBUF, so that smail
# will not try to get the utimbuf structure from a header file.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR INTERACTIVE UNIX USERS:
#
# Some versions of Interactive UNIX have a <sys/socket.h> header
# file that directly includes the <time.h> header file, which is
# not protected against multiple inclusion.  If your system has
# this problem, you will encounter a multiple declaration problem
# when compiling src/modes.o.  To repair the situation, use:
#
#	MISC_DEFINES=ISC_SOCKET_TIME_BUG
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR BSD AND SUNOS USERS:
#
# Some mail readers compare access and modify times to determine
# whether mail has been delivered which has not been read.  The local
# mail transport (using the appendfile driver) preserves access time
# for files so that this will work.  However, if smail is configured
# to use the System V convention of reading forwarding information
# from user mailbox files, then this will be defeated (the forwardto
# director does not preserve access times).
#
# Since BSD systems (and System V systems running Smail) have little
# reason to use the System V forwarding convention, it is sufficient
# to disable it.  To disable the System V forwarding convention, add
# NO_FORWARDTO_FILE to MISC_DEFINES.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR USERS OF OLD BIND RELEASES
#
# The bind resolver can make use of features in newer releases of
# BIND (named).  In particular, it will use the res_search function,
# rather than older res_mkquery function.  If you do not have the
# new BIND release (e.g., res_search is listed as an undefined
# variable when you link smail), then add OBSOLETE_RESOLVER to
# MISC_DEFINES.  Also, the res_search function does not appear to
# interract correctly with the 'defnames' attribute to the bind
# driver, on some versions of the resolv library, so beware.  If bind
# doesn't work for you, try defining OBSOLETE_RESOLVER.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR USERS OF SOME SEQUENT OS RELEASES
#
# Some releases of the Sequent C compiler recognize private as a keyword.
# However, smail uses this as a variable or structure name in several
# places.  To get around this problem use:
#
#	MISC_DEFINES=private=smail_private_tag
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR NON-POSIX OPERATING SYSTEMS
#
# Smail uses the utime() system call to set file times in a few places.
# All U*IX releases appear to support this call, although not all
# systems define the structure (utimbuf) used as an argument to the
# call.  In particular, true 4.2 and 4.3BSD do not declare this
# structure (at least not the original, non-POSIX, 4.3BSD release).
#
# The bsd4.2 and bsd4.3 conf/os files define DECLARE_UTIMBUF to cause
# smail itself to define this structure.  However, this may fail if
# your system is extended to define the utimbuf structure in an
# incompatible fashion.  This can be disabled by defining
# NO_DECLARE_UTIMBUF in MISC_DEFINES.
#
# For other operating systems, you may need to add DECLARE_UTIMBUF
# in MISC_DEFINES.  Some releases of Interactive U*IX require this.
# Other releases don't (I don't have a list).
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR USERS OF GCC ON NON-ANSI C SYSTEMS
#
# If you are using a C compiler that defines __STDC__ (such as gcc) but
# you are running into problems due to non-ANSI #include files or missing
# ANSI definitions, then you can define NO_ANSI_C.

#MISC_DEFINES=ISC_SOCKET_TIME_BUG
#MISC_DEFINES=NO_FORWARDTO_FILE		# recommended for BSD systems
#MISC_DEFINES=ISC_SOCKET_TIME_BUG:NO_FORWARDTO_FILE
#MISC_DEFINES=OBSOLETE_RESOLVER
#MISC_DEFINES=DECLARE_UTIMBUF		# if smail must define utimbuf struct
#MISC_DEFINES=NO_DECLARE_UTIMBUF	# if smail must _not_ define utimbuf
#MISC_DEFINES=private=smail_private_tag	# for sequent
#MISC_DEFINES=NO_ANSI_C			# don't believe __STDC__


# HAVE - miscellaneous supported features
#
# optional
#
# A colon-separated list of features that the local system supports
# in addition to those defined in the OS configuration file.  Some
# interesting features you might want to list are:
#
#	NDBM	      - this system supports the new DBM library
#			functions introduced in 4.3BSD.
#	DBM	      - this system supports the old DBM library
#			distributed with older BSD systems and
#			many System V systems.  This *requires* the
#			dbmclose() function, which does not exist
#			in most historic dbm implementations.
#	HDB_UUCP      - this system uses HoneyDanBer UUCP, rather
#			than a traditional version of UUCP.
#	NIALIAS	      - aliases with NeXT NetInfo databases.
#	BIND	      - the system supports the bind resolver library
#
# Defining NDBM or DBM may require the specification of additional
# libraries, in LIBS or in OSLIBS.  See conf/os/template for a more
# complete list of recognized features, and for more detailed
# descriptions.  If neither NDBM or DBM is specified, Ozan Yigit's
# sdbm (an ndbm workalike) will be used.
#
# CAUTION: The HoneyDanBer UUCP in System V Release 4.0 uses multi-
#	letter message grade values, rather than the traditional
#	single-letter message grades in earlier versions.  Smail
#	presumes that message grades are single letters, so Smail and
#	the default grades for SVR4.0 are incompatible.
#
#	As a result of this incompatiblity, either HDB_UUCP must not
#	be defined with SVR4.0, or the message grades that smail
#	uses will have to be added to the file /etc/uucp/Grades.
#	The list of grades that smail will use is specified in the
#	grades variable (whose default value can be specified by
#	setting GRADES in this file).  Grades are specified by
#	providing a longer string in the Precedence: field.  The
#	grade letters for the default value of GRADES are:
#
#		9	- special-delivery
#		A	- air-mail
#		C	- first-class	(also the default message grade)
#		a	- bulk
#		n	- junk
#
#	To add the default letters, you might add the following lines
#	to /etc/uucp/Grades:
#
#		9	9	Any	User	Any
#		A	A	Any	User	Any
#		C	C	Any	User	Any
#		a	a	Any	User	Any
#		n	n	Any	User	Any

#HAVE=HDB_UUCP				# have HoneyDanBer UUCP
#HAVE=NDBM				# have the new DBM functions
#HAVE=DBM				# have the old DBM functions
#HAVE=HDB_UUCP:NDBM			# new DBM and HoneyDanBer UUCP
HAVE=BIND


# UUCP_ZONE - this host is within the UUCP zone
#
# optional (defaults to undefined)
#
# Smail supports both strictly compliant SMTP transfers, and a
# modification the the SMTP protocol for use within the UUCP zone.
# The modified protocol transmits sender and recipient addresses in
# accordance with the RFC976 specification, and provides behavior that
# is more likely to work with other mailers in the UUCP zone.
# Transferring mail using SMTP over private IP networks can work well
# within the UUCP zone, except for the fact that the SMTP
# specification doesn't work as well in the presence of generated
# UUCP-zone routes form path files.
#
# The built-in smail transport definitions include transport
# definitions that provide either behavior: inet_zone_smtp and
# uucp_zone_smtp.  The first provides conformant behavior and should
# be used when transferring mail to sites on the Internet.  The
# second, uucp_zone_smtp, provides the modified protocol.
#
# An additional builtin transport protocol, smtp, is defined as having
# the same behavior as inet_zone_smtp or uucp_zone_smtp, depending
# upon whether UUCP_ZONE is set.  To make the the basic smtp transport
# use the modified behavior for the UUCP zone, set UUCP_ZONE to true.
#
# In the presence of generated routes from paths files, the
# Internet-zone version of the SMTP transport will generate route-addr
# addresses.  The introduction of RFC1123 removes the requirement that
# route-addrs work as routes, preferring instead the use of the %
# operator for routing.  Intermixed % and ! operators, particularly in
# the presence of an @ operator (e.g., veritas!mitsu%tron@apple.com),
# are sufficiently ambiguous that it is undesirable to use with ! or %
# operators for routing when strict SMTP compliance is needed.  This
# is one of the motivations for introducing the modified UUCP-zone
# protocol.  However, generating route-addr addresses works well for
# transferring mail between nodes running Smail 3.1.
#
# NOTE: the UUCP_ZONE flag does not affect the batched SMTP transports
# that operate through UUCP.  The uusmtp and demand_uusmtp transports
# always operate with the modified UUCP-zone protocol.  Two additional
# transports, inet_uusmtp and inet_demand_uusmtp use compliant
# protocols.

#UUCP_ZONE=true					# this site is in the UUCP zone
#UUCP_ZONE=					# this site is on the Internet


# HOSTNAMES - names for the local host
#
# optional
#
# The HOSTNAMES value is a colon-separated list of names your system.
# This does not need to include the name given by UUCP_NAME.  If
# HOSTNAMES is set, then the first name in the list will be used as the
# canonical name of your system.  That is, the name by which your
# machine can be uniquely named across all networks.
#
# Normally HOSTNAMES is not set.  In this case the HOSTNAMES value will
# be computed at run-time from the DOMAINS value and the system-dependently
# computed name of your system.
#
# If you are registered in a domain, you might consider seting HOSTNAMES
# to a list such as:   sitename.subdom.dom:sitename.dom:sitename.uucp
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the hostnames
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting HOSTNAMES
# in this file.  The value of the "hostnames" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

#HOSTNAMES=kgbvax.ussr.comm:kgbvax.uucp		# example only


# DOMAINS - domains under which the local host resides
#
# optional   (except when HOSTNAMES is not set)
#
# If HOSTNAMES is not defined, then HOSTNAMES is computed by concatenating
# local host's actual name with each name in this colon-separated list of
# domain names.  This computation is done at run-time.
#
# Example: if DOMAINS="uts.amdahl.com:uucp", then the HOSTNAMES value
# for the site "amdahl" would become "amdahl.uts.amdahl.com:amdahl.uucp".
#
# NOTE: The uucp domain is not meaningful in any standard way, though
#	many sites treat this as implying any site that is registered
#	in the UUCP zone through the USENET maps.  Sites that really
#	wish to be able to receive mail from anywhere in the world
#	should get a registered domain.
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the domains
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting DOMAINS
# in this file.  The value of the "domains" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

DOMAINS=uucp					# common
#DOMAINS=ussr.comm:uucp				# example only


# UUCP_NAME - name for the local host on the UUCP network
#
# optional
#
# This should be set to the name of the local host as known by the
# UUCP software.
#
# Normally, no value is given for this variable, in which case the
# value will be computed by smail at run-time from the actual name for
# local host, as computed in a system-dependent fashion.
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the uucp_name
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting UUCP_NAME
# in this file.  The value of the "uucp_name" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

#UUCP_NAME=kgbvax				# example only


# VISIBLE_NAME - local host name used in outgoing addresses
#
# optional
#
# Some installations may wish to hide a group of machines under a common
# name.  For example, at Amdahl, we may wish to hide the machines on our
# ethernet under the domain "uts.amdahl.com".  If we set the value
# VISIBLE_NAME="uts.amdahl.com" on the machine "futatsu", then mail
# from "futatsu" sent as if it came from "user@uts.amdahl.com" rather than
# "user@futatsu.uts.amdahl.com".  Of course, the "uts.amdahl.com" gateways
# will need to forward mail to "user", however the fact that a user
# does not have check for mail on all machines on the network is useful.
#
# The VISIBLE_NAME value will not be recognized as a name for the local
# host unless it is also included in one of the other lists of names for
# the local host.
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the visible_name
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting VISIBLE_NAME
# in this file.  The value of the "visible_name" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

#VISIBLE_NAME=kgbvax.uucp			# example only


# GATEWAY_NAMES - more names for the local host
#
# optional
#
# It is often important that hosts which are domain gateways recognize
# the domain names as alternate names for the local host.  These names
# should be defined in addition to those computed automatically from
# the actual name for the local host by putting them in GATEWAY_NAMES.
#
# This variable is a colon-separated list of names for the local host
# which is not computed from the actual name for the local host.
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the gateway_names
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting GATEWAY_NAMES
# in this file.  The value of the "gateway_names" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

#GATEWAY_NAMES=moscow.ussr.comm:ussr.comm:comm	# example only


# AUTH_DOMAINS - domains for which this host is authoritative
#
# optional (defaults to none)
#
# If this host contains all routing information needed for a particular
# set of domains, then smail should generate an error if it is given a
# hostname that is not resolved, but is within one of those domains.
# Normally, this isn't a problem because mail that is not matched by
# any routers generates a "host not found" error. However, the
# smarthost router can upset this by matching any hostname.  Without
# something to generate an error, a mail loop can occur where mail
# is sent to a host that controls a domain, and that host sends mail
# to another host listed as the "smarthost", which sends it back.
#
# A host which contains all routing information for a domain is called
# "authoritative" for that domain.  A host can be authoritative for
# any number of domains.  To declare this host to be authoritative
# for this domain, set AUTH_DOMAINS here (or auth_domains in the
# /usr/lib/smail/config file) to a colon-separated list of domains.
# This will prevent the smarthost router from matching any hosts within
# the indicated domains.
#
# NOTE: It is preferable, in most circumstances, to set the auth_domains
# variable in /usr/lib/smail/config, rather than setting AUTH_DOMAINS
# in this file.  The value of the "auth_domains" variable in the config
# file can be changed without recompiling smail.

#AUTH_DOMAINS=ussr.com
#AUTH_DOMAINS=veritas.com:tolerant.com


# POSTMASTER - the default address for the mail administrator
#
# optional	(defaults to root)
#
# This address is used by smail as a last resort in trying to deliver
# to the address "postmaster".  Normally, "postmaster" is aliased to a
# responsible person, or persons through the alias file.  In the event
# that no alias file exists, or that "postmaster" was not found in
# that file or by any other directors, the default address will be
# used.

#POSTMASTER=root


# NOBODY - a user with few access capabilities
#
# optional
#
# The user named here will be used by smail whenever a user ID is
# desired that cannot do any more damange than any unpriveledged user
# on the system.  Under 4.3BSD and SunOS, this would be the user named
# "nobody".  Under other operating systems, it may be reasonable to
# create a "nobody" entry in the passwd file.  Some systems have a
# user such as "unknown" which will suffice.
#
# If this is not defined, then a default will be chosen.  This default
# is os-type dependent, and is commonly nobody for BSD- and sun-derived
# systems.

NOBODY=nobody
#NOBODY=unknown		# some sites have this in their passwd file


# TEST_BASE - directory where smail test files are kept
#
# optional  (special when defined to an empty string)
#
# When testing smail, it is convenient to put binaries and configuration
# files in an area separated from the actual installation areas.  The
# TEST_BASE directory defines this alternate area.  Smail will assume
# assume a fixed hierarchy below this directory, with a "bin" subdirectory
# containing the smail binary and utilities, a "lib" directory containing
# smail configuration files, and a "spool" directory containing smail
# spool files.
#
# If no TEST_BASE is defined, then this facility is turned off.  If a
# TEST_BASE is defined to be an empty string, then all programs will be
# used in the area where they are compiled, LIB_DIR will be set to the
# "lib" directory under the root of the smail source tree, and SPOOL_DIRS
# will be set to the "spool" directory under the root of the smail source
# tree.  In this case, a "make install" is not required.
#
# If a TEST_BASE is defined as a relative path (e.g. "."), then it is
# defined relative to the root of the smail source directory.

#TEST_BASE=/usr/project/smail

# SMAIL_BIN_DIR - directory where copies of the smail binary are kept
#
# optional
#
# The Smail program comes in user callable names: smail, uupath,
# pathto, optto, and so on.  A copy of smail will be linked to files
# under SMAIL_BIN_DIR.  The SMAIL_BIN_DIR should be a directory
# that is commonly in users search path (i.e., $PATH).

SMAIL_BIN_DIR=!!PREFIX!!/bin			# BSD local convention

# SMAIL_NAME - file where the primary working copy of smail is located
#
# optional
#
# Any program that needs to call smail, including smail itself will
# attempt to execute the program named by SMAIL_NAME.
#
# Often the primary working copy of smail is /usr/lib/sendmail.  This
# should be used for systems that used to run sendmail.  Programs such
# as Berkeley Mail, System V mailx or /bin/mail can be made to, or do
# call /usr/lib/sendmail for mailer activity.  It is common for public
# domain programs to expect a mailer to exist under this name, also.
#
# If SMAIL_NAME is not defined here, or is set to a null string, then
# $SMAIL_BIN_DIR/smail is used instead.  If this is the name that you
# want to use as the primary binary pathname, then do set SMAIL_NAME
# to the null string.  This will prevent the smail src/Makefile from
# installing it as $SMAIL_BIN_DIR/smail twice.

#SMAIL_NAME=/usr/lib/sendmail			# common convention
#SMAIL_NAME=					# use smail in bin directory


# OTHER_SMAIL_NAMES - other names under which to install smail
#
# optional
#
# Many systems will wish to install smail as /bin/rmail to catch mail
# coming in over UUCP directly with smail.  To install under this
# name set OTHER_SMAIL_NAMES to /bin/rmail.  As implied by the name,
# other pathnames can be specified as well, if a system has other
# potential rendezvous points for mail.  This should be a colon or
# white-space separated list of full pathnames.
#
# Users of XENIX may wish to use smail as their execmail interface.
# To do this, add /usr/lib/mail/execmail to this list.
#
# This is assumed to be empty when TEST_DIR is defined.
#
# NOTE: A pathname CANNOT be in both SMAIL_NAME and OTHER_SMAIL_NAMES.

OTHER_SMAIL_NAMES=!!PREFIX!!/bin/rmail

# LIB_DIR - directory where various smail files are found
#
# required
#
# The LIB_DIR is where various static smail files reside, by default.
# Files which may reside under this directory are: the primary config
# file, the directors, routers and transports files, an aliases file,
# pathalias database, uuwho database, and the COPYING file.
#
# The common subdirectories under LIB_DIR are: "methods", where method
# files are by default found; "maps", where local pathalias files,
# mkmap configuration files and the getmap batch file are located;
# and "lists" where mailing lists are commonly located.
#
# It should be noted that none of these files, except for COPYING,
# is required by the smail binary as it is released.  See smail(5)
# and smail(8) for more details on this and related topics.

LIB_DIR=!!PREFIX!!/lib/smail


# UTIL_BIN_DIR - directory where smail utilities are located
#
# required
#
# The smail system has a number of programs such as pathalias, mkline,
# mksort, mkdbm that users normally need not execute directly.  Such
# utilities will be placed under the UTIL_BIN_DIR directory.
#
# UTIL_BIN_DIR is often the same as LIB_DIR.

UTIL_BIN_DIR=$LIB_DIR/util


# NEWALIASES - alternate pathname for mkaliases program
#
# optional
#
# For compatibility with sendmail, mkaliases can be installed under
# a name such as /usr/ucb/newaliases, or /usr/lib/newaliases.  To setup
# smail to perform this installation, set NEWALIASES to the desired full
# pathname.  When testing, this is set to the empty string, signifying
# that mkaliases will be installed only under the name mkaliases.

NEWALIASES=$UTIL_BIN_DIR/newaliases

# SECOND_CONFIG_FILE - pathname of an alternate config file
#
# optional
#
# Smail allows one to have a second set of configuration files that can
# override both the compiled in and the optional primary config file.
# Normally, the path to this secondary configuration file is defined
# in the primary smail configuration file.  However the value
# SECOND_CONFIG_FILE can be the filename of the secondary (alternate)
# config file.  In the case where both this value, and where the
# LIB_DIR/config file specifies a "second_config_file" value, the
# LIB_DIR/config file takes presidence.
#
# A secondary configuration file is useful in an environment with
# distributed filesystems.  In such an environment, the regular config
# directory can be maintained centrally on a remotely mounted
# filesystem.  Individual machines, can then setup a secondary
# configuration file which overrides these centrally maintained files
# for specific purposes.

# For example, in a network with one gateway to the outside world,
# all could share the same smail binaries and standard configuration.
# However the the gateway machine could have a secondary configuration
# file which so that the gateway's the smail setup has greater intelligence
# and thus act as a smart_user and smart_path host.

SECOND_CONFIG_FILE=				# common for non-NFS systems
#SECOND_CONFIG_FILE=/private/usr/lib/smail	# convention for NFS systems


# PATHS_FILE, PATHS_TYPE - location and type of the paths database
#
# optional
#
# If PATH_FILE begins with a '/', then it is the name of the optional
# pathalias database, otherwise it is assumed that PATH_FILE refers to
# a file under the LIB_DIR directory.
#
# For use with YP, it may be more convenient to use the "yp" type,
# rather than "aliasyp", because this way a paths file can be maintained
# in a format compatible with other YP maps.
#
# If PATHS_FILE is left undefined, no paths file is defined in the
# preloaded smail configuration.

PATHS_FILE=paths				# for file under LIB_DIR
#PATHS_FILE=mail.paths				# YP (NIS)

#PATHS_TYPE=dbm					# indexed
#PATHS_TYPE=bsearch				# sorted
PATHS_TYPE=lsearch				# linear search
#PATHS_TYPE=yp					# YP (NIS)

# ALIASES_FILE, ALIASES_TYPE - location and type of the aliases database
#
# optional
#
# If ALIASES_FILE begins with a '/', then it is the full pathname of the
# optional aliases database, otherwise it is assumed that ALIASES_FILE
# refers to a file under the LIB_DIR directory.
#
# For use with YP, it may be more convenient to use the "yp" type,
# rather than "aliasyp", because this way an alias file can be maintained
# in a format compatible with other YP maps.
#
# NOTE:	 If ALIASES_TYPE is specified as bsearch, then the suffix .sort
#	 will be appended to the filename given in ALIASES_FILE.  The
#	 mkaliases command will then treat a file without that suffix
#	 as the unsorted source file for the database.
#
# If ALIASES_FILE is left undefined, no aliases file is defined in the
# preloaded smail configuration.
#
# NOTE FOR AIX SYSTEMS:
#	I have received reports that AIX3.1 requires use of "yp",
#	rather than "aliasyp".  If this is true, I don't quite see
#	how Suns and RS/6000s running sendmail can share the same
#	YP maps.  In any case, use whatever works in your
#	environment.

ALIASES_FILE=$LIB_DIR/aliases			# compatible with sendmail
#ALIASES_FILE=aliases				# for file under LIB_DIR
#ALIASES_FILE=mail.aliases			# YP (NIS)
#ALIASES_FILE=NetInfo				# for NeXT NetInfo aliases

# ALIASES_REMOVE_SENDER - remove the sender (by default) from alias expansions
# LISTS_REMOVE_SENDER - remove the sender (by default) from list expansions
#
# optional
#
# For compatibility with sendmail, smail can be configured to remove the
# sender of a message (if the sender is a local user) from alias
# expansions.  Users can disable this feature by invoking smail with
# the -m flag, typically by setting "metoo" in their .mailrc file.
#
# However, many people find this behavior confusing and some administrators
# would prefer to disable this "sender removal" feature altogether.
# Also, it has recently been noticed that smail's sender removal
# behavior is not quite sendmail-compatible with regards to nested
# aliases and have been surprised by the results of aliasing.
#
# Smail supports two forms of aliasing to which sender removal can be
# applied: the regular aliases file (defined by ALIASES_FILE above), and
# a directory of mailing lists (typically /usr/lib/smail/lists) where
# all files in that directory define a list.  A site that has converted
# entirely over to smail3 can use alias files strictly for username
# aliasing, while using the lists directory for real mailing lists.  With
# such a usage model, sender removal should be disabled for the alias
# file, but can be enabled (depending upon preference) for the lists
# directory.
#
# To enable sender removal, set ALIASES_REMOVE_SENDER or LISTS_REMOVE_SENDER
# (depending upon preference) to "yes".  If these values are empty, or are
# note defined, then sender removal is disabled.
#
# This behavior can be configured using the run-time directors configuration
# file by setting the "sender_okay" flag, to indicate that sender removal
# should NOT be done.

#ALIASES_REMOVE_SENDER=yes
LISTS_REMOVE_SENDER=yes


# RETRY_INTERVAL - minimum per-host retry interval for TCP/IP delivery
# RETRY_DURATION - maximum time to keep messages in the input queue
#
# optional (RETRY_INTERVAL defaults to 10 minutes, RETRY_DURATION to 5 days)
#
# Messages to hosts on TCP/IP networks may block for quite some time, if
# the recipient host is down, or some intervening network is inoperative.
# Connections to such unreachable or downed hosts can block for quite
# some time until a timeout indicates indicates that the condition
# exists.
#
# To prevent the mail queue from blocking repeatedly on the same set of
# unreachable hosts, smail keeps a directory of files that store the
# last connection failure encountered for each host.  Message deliveries
# to a host that has failed recently will be deferred until a certain
# period of time (the retry interval) has elapsed, preventing queue runs
# from hanging again immediately.
#
# If a host is down for an extended period of time (such as forever),
# then sending a message to the message sender is preferable to keeping
# the message in our mail queue.  If message deliveries to a particular
# host have not succeeded within a particular length of time (the retry
# duration), smail considers delivery to have failed, and sends a bounce
# notification to the sender or address owner.
#
# Retry durations and intervals for specific hosts or domains can be
# defined by creating a retry file in $LIB_DIR and adding lines of
# the form:
#
#	hostname	duration/interval
#	*.domain	duration/interval
#
# A default can be added at the end of this file with:
#
#	*		duration/interval
#
# Alternately, a default can be specified by setting RETRY_INTERVAL
# and RETRY_DURATION in this file.  Both values are in seconds.  To
# help in calculating, 1 day is 86400 seconds.  You can actually
# use C constant expressions here, if you want to use addition or
# multiplication.
#
# These values can also be set using the retry_interval and
# retry_duration variables in $LIB_DIR/config.  In the config file
# and in the retry file, times can be specified with suffixes, such
# as 'm', 'h', or 'd' to indicate minutes, hours, or days.  For
# example:
#
#	*.uu.net	3d/10m

RETRY_INTERVAL=600		# 10 minutes
#RETRY_INTERVAL='20*60'		# 20 minutes
RETRY_DURATION='86400*5'	# 5 days
#RETRY_DURATION='86400*14'	# 2 weeks


# UUCP_SYSTEM_FILE - path to UUCP file containing remote systems
#
# optional
#
# The normal smail configuration defines a router that scans the
# output of the /usr/bin/uuname command for neighboring UUCP sites.
# When smail is running as a daemon, it can cache the output of uuname
# so that the uuname command need not be executed for each mail
# message.  In order to be able to detect when the output of uuname
# will change, smail daemons will stat the UUCP configuration file
# which contains the names of neighboring hosts.  This EDITME variable
# defines the full pathname to this file.  If this variable is not
# defined, then the output of the uuname will not be cached.
#
# NOTE:	Many OS files specify the correct file for this, though some
#	don't.  Also, if you add HoneyDanBer UUCP to a system that
#	does not normally have it, then you will need to set this.

#UUCP_SYSTEM_FILE=/usr/lib/uucp/L.sys		# use this for normal UUCP
#UUCP_SYSTEM_FILE=/usr/lib/uucp/Systems		# use this for HoneyDanBer UUCP
#UUCP_SYSTEM_FILE=/etc/uucp/Systems		# for System V Release 4


# SPOOL_DIRS - smail spooling directories
#
# required
#
# Smail can use one or more spooling directories, where spool directories
# other than the first are used if earlier spool directories were
# inaccessible or were on file systems which filled up.  The list of spool
# directories should be colon-separated and may contain only one spool
# directory if desired.

SPOOL_DIRS=/var/spool/smail			# common
#SPOOL_DIRS=/var/spool/smail			# for System V Release 4
#SPOOL_DIRS=/usr/spool/smail:/usr2/spool/smail	# use of alternate filesystem
#SPOOL_DIRS=/usr/smail/spool			# I use this right now
#SPOOL_DIRS=/var/smail/spool			# Another alternative


# LOG_DIR - smail logging directory
#
# optional (defaults to (more or less) $SPOOL_DIRS/log)
#
# Smail creates two log files in this directory: logfile and paniclog.
# The first is a file that logs all incoming messages and deliveries,
# plus many errors.  The second file (paniclog) logs important system
# errors that smail can manage to write into the log file.

#LOG_DIR=/usr/spool/smail/log			# common
LOG_DIR=/var/spool/smail/log			# for System V Release 4
#LOG_DIR=/usr/smail/log				# I use this right now
#LOG_DIR=/var/smail/log				# Another alternative


# UNSHAR_MAP_DIR - where unshared USENET map files are to be placed
#
# optional
#
# The getmap utility will read a list of files on the file
# LIB_DIR/map/batch, and using unsharmap unshar these maps into the
# UNSHAR_MAP_DIR directory.
#
# A common way that maps are distributed is through the USENET news group
# "comp.mail.maps".  A sys file line of:
#
#	usenet-maps:comp.mail.maps,world:F:<UNSHAR_MAP_DIR>/work/batch
#
# will add names into the UNSHAR_MAP_DIR/work/batch file for getmap to
# process.
#
# If UNSHAR_MAP_DIR is not defined, then the getmap and uuwho utilities
# will not function.

UNSHAR_MAP_DIR=/var/spool/uumaps
#UNSHAR_MAP_DIR=/var/spool/uumaps		# for System V Release 4


# NEWS_SPOOL_DIR - where news articles are stored
#
# optional (defaults to /usr/spool/news)
#
# C News stores pathnames in the batch file that are relative to
# the top-level of the news article directory hierarchy.  Smail needs
# to know the name of this directory in order to be able to extract
# the news articles from comp.mail.maps.

#NEWS_SPOOL_DIR=/usr/spool/news
NEWS_SPOOL_DIR=/var/spool/news


# UUWHO_FILE - file used to store the uuwho file
#
# optional (defaults to $LIB_DIR/uuwho)
#
# This specified the file used to store the host database generated by
# and used by the uuwho command.  If the uuwho database is stored in a
# DBM file, then UUWHO_FILE is the file prefix before adding the .pag
# and .dir suffixes to form the actual files.
#
# If UUWHO_FILE does not begin with /, then the name is relative to
# the $LIB_DIR directory.

#UUWHO_FILE=$UNSHAR_MAP_DIR/uuwho	# to store database with the map files


# UUWHO_USE_DBM - configure the uuwho command to use the DBM library
#
# optional
#
# If you would like the uuwho utility to use the DBM library, set
# UUWHO_USE_DBM to true.  If this is not set, then the uuwho utility
# will use a sorted database.  Earlier versions of the uuwho utility
# worked only with the DBM library.
#
# Not using DBM does not result in any real measurable speed-up, since
# binary searches of even large databases happen fast enough to
# prevent users from noticing.  However, generation of the DBM uuwho
# database can take significantly longer.  The uuwho utility creates
# sorted databases by calling the sort utility, which is usually quite
# fast.

UUWHO_USE_DBM=true				# use DBM
#UUWHO_USE_DBM=					# default, don't use DBM


# TMP_DIR - secure temp directory used by smail utilities
#
# optional (defaults to /tmp)
#
# Some smail utilities use TMP_DIR to define a directory in which
# their temporary files can be created.  Utilities that use this
# directory are those that wish to use a secure temporary area.
#
# The only smail utilities that need to use TMP_DIR are utilities that
# should be run as root, or as some other user with appropriate privledges.  
# It is therefore recommended that TMP_DIR not be globally writable.  

TMP_DIR=/var/tmp


# SECURE_PATH - path for smail utilities
#
# optional (defaults to system-specific path or /bin:/usr/bin)
#
# The smail utilities often set their PATH to begin with the SECURE_PATH.
# The SECURE_PATH should be a path of directories where standard commands
# are located.  These directories and commands should not be writeable by
# normal users.  A common directory for smail utilities to append to
# SECURE_PATH is UTIL_BIN_DIR.

#SECURE_PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb		# common for BSD systems
#SECURE_PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/amdahl/bin	# common for UTS/580 systems
#SECURE_PATH=/bin:/usr/bin			# common for System V system


# MAN1 - where smail user command man pages are to be installed
# MAN5 - where smail file format man pages are to be installed
# MAN8 - where smail administrator man pages should be installed
# MAN1_EXT - file extension for user command man pages
# MAN5_EXT - file extension for file format man pages
# MAN8_EXT - file extension for adminstrator man pages
#
# optional
#
# The man page for "foo.an" in the smail man/man5 source directory
# will be installed in MAN5/foo.MAN5_EXT, if MAN5 is defined.
#
# For some reason, BSD and System V differ on where file format man
# pages are kept, hence the unusual values of MAN5 for System V.

# COMPRESS - file compression
#
# optional (default is system dependent or uses cat)
#
# The savelog utility can save space by compressing old log files.
# Normally when a file is compressed, the suffix is added to the
# filename.
#
# The COMPRESS symbol is the name of a program such that:
#
#		$COMPRESS $COMP_FLAG filename ...
#
# the file: filename is replaced by: filename$DOT_Z
# regardless of the size of filename.  The command:
#
#		$UNCOMPRESS filename$DOT_Z
#
# will replace filename$DOT_Z with the original filename.
# The command:
#		$ZCAT filename$DOT_Z
#
# will read the compressed file: filename$DOT_Z and write the
# plain text to standard output while leaving the file compressed.

# MISC_C_DEFINES - miscellaneous #defines for C programs
#
# optional
#
# The value of MISC_C_DEFINES is included directly into the file defs.h
# in each source directory.  It is useful as a central place for
# miscellaneous #defines not otherwise setable above.  In particular,
# it is useful for overriding other more values given in the file
# src/config.h.  It was felt that it was appropriate to keep the
# EDITME file fairly small, with only a reasonable subset of the
# configurable aspects of smail being explicitly described.  As a
# result, there may be some other things in config.h that you may
# wish to change.  Use #define's here to accomplish this.
#
# A suitable collection of #undef's and #define's here can also
# change the behavior defined in the file under conf/os or conf/arch
# for your operating system and architecture.  However, use of
# MISC_C_DEFINES for this is discouraged.
#
# As with /bin/sh scripts, a logical line beginning with a : causes
# that line to be parsed but ignored.  If it were simply commented out
# then the second line would be processed.

# MISC_SH_DEFINES - miscellaneous script to include in defs.sh
#
# optional
#
# The value of MISC_SH_DEFINES is included directly into the file
# defs.sh, in each source directory.  It is a useful place to store
# script lines to override values set by the mkdefs.sh shell script
# or in a conf/os or conf/arch file.
#
# As with /bin/sh scripts, a logical line beginning with a : causes
# that line to be parsed but ignored.  If it were simply commented out
# then the second line would be processed.



# MISC_SED_DEFINES - miscellaneous lines to include in defs.sed
#
# optional
#
# The value of MISC_SED_DEFINES is included directly into the file
# defs.sed, in each source directory.  It is a useful place to store
# sed lines to override lines set by the mkdefs.sh shell script from
# information in a conf/os or conf/arch file.
#
# As with /bin/sh scripts, a logical line beginning with a : causes
# that line to be parsed but ignored.  If it were simply commented out
# then the second line would be processed.

# We can't readily think of good examples for this one.
