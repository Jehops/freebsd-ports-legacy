This is Smail, a program used for receiving and delivering mail.
Its job is to take mail from sources on the local or
on remote hosts and deliver to the appropriate destinations.
This may be either on remote hosts or on the local machine.
It is not intended to be a user interface for reading and
submitting mail.
