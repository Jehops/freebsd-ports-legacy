WARNING: We don't have statistics yet, so the system isn't robust in the presence of 
unreliable servers in the directory.  Please don't publish a server if you don't think 
you can keep it up for a good while.  To enable the mixminion server, set 
mixminiond_enable="YES" in your /etc/rc.conf and edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/mixminiond.conf.
