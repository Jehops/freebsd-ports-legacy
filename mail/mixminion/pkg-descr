Mixminion is the standard implementation of the Type III anonymous remailer
protocol, which lets you send very anonymous email.  This best-of-breed
remailer uses conservative design approaches to provide security against most
known attacks.  We chose a simple, extensible design so that we can provide a
robust core system and then experiment with new research features such as
dummy policies, directory servers, and reputation systems.

You can find the latest information at http://mixminion.net/, or on the

consider subscribing, especially if you're going to run a node.

This is a testing alpha release.  You will probably only want to use it if
you are technically inclined, curious, and interested in helping the
Mixminion development effort.

WARNING!  Do NOT use this release if you require strong anonymity.  It has
known deficiencies, including some that make it possible for an adversary
to trace your message through the system.
