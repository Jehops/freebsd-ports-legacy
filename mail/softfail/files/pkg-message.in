Please note that you have just installed softfail on

	%%QMAIL_PREFIX%%/bin/softfail

Before using it you need to properly create the MySQL database. A customized
SQL sample was installed on

	%%DOCSDIR%%/softfail.sql

You can use this sample as root user for MySQL:

 mysql -uroot -p <  %%DOCSDIR%%/softfail.sql

To use it you should configure SMTPEXTFORK's enviroment variable on qmail
according to the instructions available on

	%%DOCSDIR%%/README

You are also suggested to add the following entries to /etc/crontab:

	@daily	root    %%PREFIX%%/bin/rotate-softfail-db
	@daily	root	%%PREFIX%%/bin/rotate-softfail.sh

I can do it for you. Just type `make crontab-entry' if you wish me to add it.
