	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read /var/qmail/doc/PORT_NOTES.
It contains important information about testing and configuring
qmail, and finally replacing sendmail with qmail.

You should also add /var/qmail/man to your MANPATH (see manpath(1)
or login.conf(5)).

Do not forget to read /var/qmail/doc/QLDAPINSTALL. After all,
this is NOT our old stock qmail.
