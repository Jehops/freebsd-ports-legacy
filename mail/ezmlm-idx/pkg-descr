ezmlm is an easy-to-use, high-speed mailing list manager for qmail.

This is an addition and patch to ezmlm-0.53 [(c) Dan J. Bernstein].
Ezmlm-idx uses only Dan's libraries and heavily relies on ezmlm-0.53 code.
ezmlm-idx does not function without ezmlm-0.53.

ezmlm-idx-0.31 adds threaded archive retrieval, digest creation,
subscription moderation, remote administration, message moderation,
a fully configurable ezmlm-make list setup and editing commands and
a large number of other options to ezmlm lists. See man pages and
FAQ.idx for more information. It also adds support for user- or
host-wide integration of lists with a ``majordomo@''-style interface
(see ezmlm-request.1 and FAQ).

To use ezmlm-idx with other languages, copy the correct ezmlmrc.XX file
(where XX is the iso 639 language code) to /etc/ezmlmrc or ~/.ezmlmrc.
If the appropriate one doesn't exist, feel free to make a translations
(please leave comments English for the benefit of maintenance) and mail
to lindberg@id.wustl.edu. See FAQ.idx for more info.
