ezmlm-idx is an addition and patch to ezmlm-0.53.

ezmlm-idx adds multi-message threaded archive retrieval, digests, remote
administration, message and subscription moderation, subscriber-only
restrictions, message trailer, subject prefix, subscriber name storage,
customizable setup, multi-language and MIME support and more. In addition,
improved bounce handling, case-insensitive subscriber address storage, and
support for distributed lists (main + sublist transparent to the
subscriber).

ezmlm-idx can now be compiled with MySQL support for centrally administrated
distributed lists with binaries that autosense use of SQL or standard ezmlm
databases.
