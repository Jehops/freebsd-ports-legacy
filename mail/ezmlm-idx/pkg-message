ezmlm-idx has been installed successfully.

However, before you can use the programs, you should copy the
"ezmlmglrc.sample", "ezmlmrc.sample" and "ezmlmsubrc.sample" files
in ${PREFIX}/etc to "ezmlmglrc", "ezmlmrc" and "ezmlmsubrc"
respectively.

Usually, you do not need to edit these files, but be sure to check
carefully.

If you have enabled the MySQL extensions, you need to create an
ezmlm database. See INSTALL.idx in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ezmlm-idx.
