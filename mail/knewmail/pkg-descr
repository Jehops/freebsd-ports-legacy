KNewMail is a KDE app designed to check your pop3 servers and/or local
servers for waiting mail, then return the headers of the mail. It is a
small app that will just sit in the panel and can either check the
servers at preset intervals, or only when forced. KNewMail will notify
you by popup message, sound, and/or the header list.
