FireMIME is a library providing an easy to use, callback-based interface
for parsing MIME-encoded messages. It parses messages in accordance with
RFC2045 and RFC2046, attempting to follow all rules set out in those
documents while still allowing leniency with some common errors. FireMIME
uses libfirestring for string handling. This allows it to be completely
8bit clean, including allowing \0 anywhere in messages.
