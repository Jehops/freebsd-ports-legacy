BE AWARE! Kaspersky Lab has their own look on files and dirs hierarchy,
which doesn't correspond with hier(7) manual page. Probably you'll want
to manually move executable bunaries and configs as you need. Also you
have to keep in mind that downloadbale trial version of KAV Daemon has
some restrictions.

3. When you encountered, that pointed up directory already does not exist,
visit a www.kaspersky.com site in order to resolve this problem. I am not
