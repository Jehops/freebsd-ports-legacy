This is a sendmail filter, based on Milter API, intedned to do
antiviral check through Kaspersky Antivirus. It doesn't checks mail
itself, but passes it to preliminary setuped Kaspersky Antivirus
to check, reads result, and, depending it, discards/rejects or
passes mail. This check issued 'in-place' delivery processing, so,
nor extracting, nor extra reinjecting in/out mail queue doesn't
issued. But this program is NOT mail transfer agent and NOT
antivirus itself. At first glance it is a set of hooks, which
executed when sendmail takes some appropriate actions - connecting
remote server, receiving MAIL FROM or RCPT TO,
transferring header or body of message, etc.
