Turba has been installed in %%TURBADIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see
%%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde2/pkg-message.

Then, you will have to tune the configuration files located in

sources.php.

You have to create a table in your database; please see
%%TURBADIR%%/scripts/drivers.
You might create a LDAP schema: please see the doc LDAP.

WARNING! if you are upgrading from Turba v. 1.1, you have to alter your
******** schemas. Please read the doc UPDATE. An example is given for
         MySQL in %%TURBADIR%%/scripts/drivers/:
         - mysql_upgrade_1.1_to_1.2.sql.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
