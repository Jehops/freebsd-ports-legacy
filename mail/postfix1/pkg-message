If you have postfix configured in your /etc/mail/mailer.conf (answered yes to
the previous question) and would like to enable postfix to start at boot time,
please set these variables in your /etc/rc.conf file:

sendmail_enable="YES"
sendmail_flags="-bd"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

  **OR**

sendmail_enable="NONE"

then type this command as root:

ln -s /usr/local/sbin/postfix /usr/local/etc/rc.d/postfix.sh

Either of these will disable Sendmail completely.  The latter form is useful
if you need to wait until other local package initialization (such as ldconfig
for Postgres or MySQL) is done.  The former method will start postfix very
early on in the boot process.


Also, you will want to disable some Sendmail-specific daily maintenance
routines in your /etc/periodic.conf file:

daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"                                      
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"


If you are using SASL, you need to make sure that postfix has access to read
the sasldb file.  This is accomplished by adding postfix to group mail and
making the /usr/local/etc/sasldb* file(s) readable by group mail (this should
be the default for new installs).
