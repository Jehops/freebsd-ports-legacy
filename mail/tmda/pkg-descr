Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA).

TMDA is a OSI-certified python application designed to significantly
reduce (or eliminate) the amount of SPAM/UCE you receive by using
unique, cryptographically enhanced (tagged) e-mail addresses.  TMDA
can both filter your incoming e-mail, and tag your outgoing address.
