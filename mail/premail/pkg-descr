     The main function of premail is adding support for encrypted e-mail
     to your mailer, using plain PGP, PGP/MIME, MOSS, or
     S/MIME.
     
     In addition, premail provides a seamless, transparent interface to
     the anonymous remailers, including full support for Mixmaster
     remailers and the nymservers. Nymservers provide cryptographically
     protected, fully anonymous accounts for both sending and receiving
     e-mail.

     While premail can be used as a stand-alone application, it works
     best when integrated with your mailer. Currently, premail is
     integrated completely seamlessly and transparently only with
     Netscape 3.0's built-in mailer. It works fairly well with Pine
     3.94 or later, as well (plain PGP is supported, but decryption of
     MIME-based e-mail encryption protocols is still missing).
     Transparent integration of outgoing mail only is supported for any
     mailer in which the mail sending program can be configured,
     including Berkeley mail, most emacs mailers, and MH. For these
     mailers, you can decode messages with a single command.
