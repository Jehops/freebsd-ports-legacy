maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent.
maildrop reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers
the message to your mailbox. maildrop knows how to deliver mail to
mbox-style mailboxes and maildirs. "maildir" is the mailbox format
used by the Qmail MTA.  maildrop is written in C++, and handles
resources more efficiently.

maildrop can be used with sendmail, Qmail, and other MTAs.
