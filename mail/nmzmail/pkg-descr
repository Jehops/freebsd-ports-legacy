nmzmail is a tool to use the namazu2 search engine from within the mutt
mail reader to search mail stored in maildir folders. Based on the
result of the namazu query, nmzmail generates a maildir folder
containing symbolic links to the mails matching the query. A simple mutt
macro makes easy to use nmzmail from within mutt.

Features:
		* fast mail searching even with large number of mails
		* incremental index building
		* rich query language including regular expressions (see the
		  namazu documentation)
		* integrates nicely into mutt
		* query history
