Mail Notification is a status icon (aka tray icon) that informs you if you
have new mail.

It works with system trays implementing the freedesktop.org System Tray
Specification, such as the GNOME Panel Notification Area, the Xfce
Notification Area and the KDE System Tray.

Mail Notification features include:

	* multiple mailbox support
	* mbox, MH, Maildir, POP3, IMAP, Gmail, Evolution and Sylpheed support
	* SASL authentication support
	* APOP authentication support
	* SSL/TLS support
	* automatic detection of mailbox format
	* immediate notification (the status icon is updated immediately or
	  within seconds after a mailbox changes)
	* a mail summary
	* HIG 2.0 compliance
