Qmail-Scanner is e-mail content scanner that enables a qmail server to
scan all messages it receives for certain characteristics (normally viruses),
and react accordingly.

If you have a commercial virus scanner (eg, Sophos sweep, McAfee
uvscan, etc) installed when you build qmail-scanner, qmail-scanner
will configure itself to use that.  Otherwise, it will only use its
internal content filter which only allows you to block mail based
on text in the subject/body, general types of attachments, etc.
