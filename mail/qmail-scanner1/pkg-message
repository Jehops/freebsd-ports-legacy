NOTES:
 - You have to configure your anti-virus and anti-spams products!
 - You HAVE to reinstall this port each time you add or remove one!

Now, you have to modify your qmail startup files to call qmail-scanner.
In most case, you just need to add:
  export QMAILQUEUE="${PREFIX}/bin/qmail-scanner-queue.pl"
to your tcpserver startup file.

You can test installation by running 'make test' in port dir.
