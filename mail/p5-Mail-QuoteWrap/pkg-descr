A Mail::QuoteWrap object expects its text member to contain a reference
to a list of lines of text, such as the output of methods like body
News::Article().  It can then produce quotified output, optionally
prepended with the quote mark designated by output_quotechar, within the
width specified by columns.

Mail::QuoteWrap specificially does not solve the following problems:

It does not handle munged quote characters, such as those produced by the
AOHell newsreader or similar gunge:
 >> This >is a second-generation quote, but it
 > looks >>like a nasty mix of first- and second->
 > generation >>material.

It does not automatically detect and bypass news or mail headers. That
is not the role of this object.

It assumes a paragraph structure to the quoted text and doesn't try to
enforce any other. If you want a module that detects document structure
and deals well with it, look at Text::Autoformat.
