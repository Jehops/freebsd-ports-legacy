KSig is a tool for managing a collection of signatures in KDE 3.
It stores the signatures in an XML file and will when called
as ksig --random prints a random signature, or ksig --daily
a different signature each day to stdout.

This is easy to integrate into KMail's (or presumably other
mail clients') signature configuration to append these signatures
to outgoing mails.
