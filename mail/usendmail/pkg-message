Now you have to change your sendmail(8) wrapping:

If you are using mailwrapper(8), do the following:

in /etc/mail/mailer.conf replace the lines

sendmail	%%QMAIL_DIR%%/bin/sendmail
send-mail	%%QMAIL_DIR%%/bin/sendmail

with

sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/usendmail
send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/usendmail

Otherwise replace the link from /usr/sbin/sendmail to
%%QMAIL_DIR%%/bin/sendmail with one to %%PREFIX%%/sbin/usendmail.
