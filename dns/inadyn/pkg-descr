INADYN is a dynamic DNS client. That is, it maintains the IP address of a host 
name. It periodically checks whether the IP address stored by the DNS server 
is the real current address of the machine that is running INADYN.
It supports the following dynamic DNS services: dyndns.org (in all three 
flavors: dynamic, static, custom), freedns.afraid.org, zoneedit.com, no-ip.com
