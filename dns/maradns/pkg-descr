MaraDNS is a DNS server with the following features:

* Security-aware programming. A DNS server needs to be secure. There is a
number of security features in the code, including:

	1. The code uses a special string library which is resistant to buffer
	overflows.
	2. The code, if started as root, mandates running as an unprivledged
	user in a chroot() jail.

* Open-Source. This DNS server is public-domain code. There are no restrictions
attached to this code.

* Simplicity. This DNS server has the minimum number of features needed to
correctly act as an authoritative name server for a domain.
