            *** Attention ! *** Attention ! ***

This port did NOT replace the named supplied with FreeBSD 
but installed in its own place. 
The executables reside now in @PREFIX@

You MUST change /etc/rc.conf accordingly and give the full 
pathname to start named, both manually or from a config 
file. 

If you dont do that, the new named version will not run !
