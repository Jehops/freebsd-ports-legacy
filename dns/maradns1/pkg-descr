MaraDNS is a package that implements the Domain Name Service (DNS), an
essential internet service. MaraDNS has the following advantages:

o Secure. MaraDNS has a security history as good as or better than any other DNS
  server. For example, MaraDNS has always randomized, using a secure random
  number generator, the Query ID and source port of DNS queries; and was never
  vulnerable to the "new" cache poisoning attack.
o Supported. MaraDNS has a long history of being maintained and updated.
  Actively developed since 2001, MaraDNS continues to be fully supported: The
  most recent release was done on August 4, 2009. Deadwood, the code that will
  become part of MaraDNS 2.0, is frequently updated.
o Easy to use. A basic recursive configuration needs only a single three-line
  configuration file. A basic authoritative configuration needs only a four-line
  configuration file and a one-line zone file. MaraDNS is fully documented, with
  both easy-to-follow tutorials and a complete and up-to-date reference manual.
o Small. MaraDNS is well suited for embedded applications and other environments
  where the server must use the absolute minimum number of resources possible.
  MaraDNS' binary is smaller than that of any other currently maintained
  recursive DNS server.
o Open Source. MaraDNS is fully open-source, The license is a two-clause BSD
  license that is almost identical to the FreeBSD license.
