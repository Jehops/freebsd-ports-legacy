Version 2 of dnscrypt-proxy is written in Go and in FreeBSD it's
not capable to drop root privileges after binding a low port (53),
Go issue [1][2].

For default dnscrypt-proxy2 is listening in port 5353 using username
_dnscrypt-proxy.

You can change your rc.conf/config to use port 53 and root but it's
not recommended.

It's needed some tweaks to use dnscrypt-proxy2 on port 5353 on your
machine, some examples below to redirect localhost port 53 to 5353:

[ipfw]

  ipfw nat 1 config if lo0 reset same_ports \
    redirect_port tcp 127.0.0.1:5353 53 \
    redirect_port udp 127.0.0.1:5353 53
  ipfw add nat 1 ip from any to 127.0.0.1 via lo0

  /etc/rc.conf:
    firewall_nat_enable="YES"

  /etc/sysctl.conf:
    net.inet.ip.fw.one_pass=0

[pf]

  rdr pass on lo0 proto { tcp udp } from any to port 53 -> 127.0.0.1 port 5353

[unbound]

  server:
    interface: 127.0.0.1
    do-not-query-localhost: no
    hide-identity: yes
    hide-version: yes

  forward-zone:
    name: "."
    forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5353
