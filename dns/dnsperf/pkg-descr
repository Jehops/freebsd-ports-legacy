DNSPerf and ResPerf Provide Communication Providers with Predictive
Planning Tools to Scale Networks.

Two tools, DNSPerf and ResPerf deliver accurate performance metrics
of Domain Name Services (DNS).  These tools are easy-to-use and
simulate real Internet workloads to provide the necessary insight
that carriers need to plan and deploy network services.

DNSPerf measures Authoritative Domain Name services and is designed
to simulate network conditions by self-pacing the query load.

Caching services performance and workload profile differ significantly
from Authoritative Domain services; therefore a different tool is
needed. ResPerf is designed specifically to simulate Caching Domain
Name services. To test a caching server, ResPerf systematically
increases the query rate and monitors the response rate.
