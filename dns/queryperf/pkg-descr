This is queryperf, a DNS server query performance testing tool.

It is primarily intended for measuring the performance of authoritative
DNS servers, but it has also been used for measuring caching server
performance. 

See /usr/local/share/docs/queryperf//queryperf.txt for more information
on the command line option and the required configuration files.
