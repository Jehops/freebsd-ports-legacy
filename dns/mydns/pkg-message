To get MyDNS working you will need to do some configuration, first you
will need to create %%%PREFIX%%%/etc/mydns.conf based on the
installed sample file. Following that you will need to setup your
database tables, you can use the output of
%%%PREFIX%%%/sbin/mydns --create-tables
as a template.

If you're upgrading from a version before 0.9.12 then please read the
instructions at http://mydns.bboy.net/ptr.html before running MyDNS
