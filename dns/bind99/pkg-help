If using a chrooted instance of BIND on FreeBSD 8.x and 9.x,
the OpenSSL engines MUST be accessible from within the chroot.
If BIND is chrooted in /var/named, this can be achieved by
either copying content of /usr/local/lib/engines into
/var/named/usr/local/lib/engines, or by creating that directory
and adding this line to /etc/fstab:
/usr/local/lib/engines  /var/named/usr/local/lib/engines nullfs ro 0 0
