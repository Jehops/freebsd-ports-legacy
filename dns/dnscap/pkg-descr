cap is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS
traffic. It produces binary data in pcap(3) format, either on
standard output (by default) or in successive dump files (if the d
command line option is given.) This utility is similar to tcpdump(1),
but has finer grained packet recognition tailored to DNS transactions
and protocol options. dnscap is expected to be used for gathering
continuous research or audit traces.
