*	If you are running BIND 9 in a chroot environment, make		*
*	sure that there is a /dev/random device	in the chroot.		*
*									*
*	BIND 9 also requires configuration of rndc, including a		*
*	"secret" key.  The easiest, and most secure way to configure	*
*	rndc is to run 'rndc-confgen -a' to generate the proper	conf	*
*	file, with a new random key, and appropriate file permissions.	*
*									*
*	The /etc/rc.d/named script in the base will do both for you.    *

*	Please note: BIND 9.3.6 has been classified as "End of Life"	*
*	as of 1 December 2008 by the ISC.  The port will be supported	*
*	through the lifetime of the RELENG_6 branch, currently		*
*	scheduled to be supported through 30 November 2010.		*
