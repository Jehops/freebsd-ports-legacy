# PROVIDE: dnsmasq
# REQUIRE: SERVERS named
# BEFORE:  DAEMON ntpdate rpcbind
# KEYWORD: shutdown
#
# The BEFORE: line above contains individual services that have a
# REQUIRE: named line, to make sure dnsmasq starts early enough
# for those, in case dnsmasq is listed in /etc/resolv.conf.
# 
# The REQUIRE: named above is for configurations where named
# acts as a resolver, and dnsmasq is used to "blend in" local
# domain names.
#
#
# Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf
# to enable this service:
#
# dnsmasq_enable (bool):  Set to "NO" by default.
#                         Set it to "YES" to enable dnsmasq at boot.
#
# Further settings you can change in /etc/rc.conf if desired:
#
# dnsmasq_conf (path):    Set to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dnsmasq.conf by default.
#                         Set it to another configuration file if you want.
#
# dnsmasq_flags (string): Empty by default. Set it to additional command
#                         line arguments if desired.
