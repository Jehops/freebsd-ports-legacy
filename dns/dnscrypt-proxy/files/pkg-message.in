This port/software comes all 'working out of the box'.

By default this port is using OpenDNS' resolvers,
but other nameservers are also possible.

To view available options, run:
%%PREFIX%%/sbin/dnscrypt-proxy --help
or read the manual: `man dnscrypt-proxy`

You might like to adjust
%%ETCDIR%%/rc.d/dnscrypt-proxy
accordingly with your needs and/or preferences.

To enable dnscrypt-proxy at boot:
echo dnscrypt_proxy_enable=\"YES\" >> /etc/rc.conf
