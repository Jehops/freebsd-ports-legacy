*   Do consider to use nsd-4.0.1. Support for the nsd-3 branch
*   will stop in future
*                                                                        *
*   To run nsd from startup, add nsd_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf   *
*                                                                        *
*   Take good care when using nsd commands, since they often need to     *
*   be executed as user dedicated to nsd, in order for the files it      *
*   touches or creates to have the proper permissions.                   *
*                                                                        *
