A sample config file is located in %%INSTALLDIR%%/inc/config.inc.php.sample
You now need to add an alias to apache's httpd.conf pointing to
${INSTALLDIR} in order to access PowerAdmin from your web brower,
or create a VirtualHost with DocumentRoot set to that directory.
	Alias /poweradmin/	%%INSTALLDIR%%/
		or
	DocumentRoot		%%INSTALLDIR%%/
