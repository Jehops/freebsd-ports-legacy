This is a port of SatTrack version 3.1, written by manfred Bester.
SatTrack is a satellite tracking program.  It provides two different
live displays, for single or multiple satellites, and two different
orbit prediction facilities.  Cursor controls used in both live
displays are compatible with the VT100 standard, which allows the
program to be run basically from any terminal.  An X Window color
graphics display with the typical world map tracking chart and a
number of important features has been added in this version.  The
orbit prediction can be run either interactively or in a batch
mode.  In the latter case all necessary parameters are specified
on the command line.
