This program computes ephemerides of Sun, Moon, planets, comets, and stars
using rigorous reduction methods from the _Astronomical Almanac_ and related
sources. Includes PLAN404 series for positions of the planets, and a long-term
extension of modern Lunar theory for the Moon's position. Reads ASCII file
catalogues of stars and orbital elements. Displays all adjustments as it finds
local azimuth and elevation, rise and set times, etc.
