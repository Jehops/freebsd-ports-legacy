Ksetiwatch is a monitoring tool for the Seti@home distributed computing project,
which searches for signals of extraterrestrial life. 
It displays the state of the Seti@home client(s) running on your computer or in
your local network, and logs/manages completed work units. In addition, 
Ksetiwatch features a skymap that displays all work units processed, 
a graphical display of scientific data (gaussians, pulses, and triplets), 
a dock icon with detailed status information about a client, the option to 
start/stop the SETI@home clients, and much more.
