****  To enable start/stop of the seti@home client, please run "setiathome"
      as your login name.
      If you installed "setiathome" by ports or package, add, change or
      uncomment the seti_user variable in %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.setiathome.conf
      (or %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/setiathome.conf depending on the version currently
      installed on your computer)
            seti_user=nobody
                      ^^^^^^
      to your login name before setting up working directory, such as :
            seti_user=<your_login_name>
      If you already done this as nobody, do
            %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/setiathome.sh stop
            chown -Rh <your_login_name> /var/db/setiathome
            %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/setiathome.sh start
****  Known Bugs
      For instance, default values have to be set manually using the panel
      preferences (right-click):
	set the value of "Basic->Directory containing the seti@home executable"
	to /var/db/setiathome
	check "Advanced->Use seti@home exe in a different directory"
	and set it's value to %%LOCALBASE%%/sbin
      Also, running xsetiathome by double-clicking the radar icon isn't
      possible right now.
