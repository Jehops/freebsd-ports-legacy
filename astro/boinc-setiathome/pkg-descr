SETI - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence

Use your unused CPU cycles to aid in computations analyzing radio
telescope information for possible signs of ET.

This version of SETI@home is based on BOINC (Berkeley Open
Infrastructure for Network Computing).  Several other projects
besides SETI@home are using BOINC.  BOINC lets you participate in
more than one project, and it lets you specify what fraction of
your computer time should go to each project.

This port requires net/boinc-client and together these supersede
the astro/setiathome port which is now known as SETI-Classic.

Be sure to join the "FreeBSD" team on the SETI website once you're
up and running.
