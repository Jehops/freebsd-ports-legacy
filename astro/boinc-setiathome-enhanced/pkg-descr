SETI - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence -- Enhanced version

Use your unused CPU cycles to aid in computations analyzing radio
telescope information for possible signs of ET.  The Enhanced version
is still beta, but this is mainly for administrative reasons.

This version is a FreeBSD binary built by Stefan Urbat for Pentium II
or AMD K6 CPUs and higher (requires MMX instructions).
