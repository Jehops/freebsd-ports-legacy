This Perl class provides an object oriented API which lets you gather
SETI@home stats from one or more machines and gives you a programmatic
way of getting access to them.  It can cope with multiple SETI@home
clients which share a directory hierarchy accessible to the machine it
is run on, clients which each have their own private filespace (using
rsh, ssh or equivalent) and even works for boxes running Windows NT.

SETI::Stats borrows from Jan Rocho's perlseti.pl, but differs in
several ways - this is a module devoted to stats gathering rather than
a general purpose control program, it can be used to monitor remote
machines without even requiring Perl to be installed on them, and
it provides a generic framework for access to (both local and remote)
SETI@home client stats.  It could also be extended to cover stats
gathering from the SETI@home WWW server, though this may be better done
in a separate module to avoid code bloat.
