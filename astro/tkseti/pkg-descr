tkseti is a nice Tk interface to the SETI@Home program.  It shows
current best spikes and gaussians for the user and can be used in
multiple directories.  It can also fetch the user's statistics from
the seti@home web site.

tkseti can be started if the client is already running, or it can 
start the client manually or automatically for you.  It will look for
the client files in the directory /var/db/setiathome . If you've run 
the client elsewhere, or run more than one client, just specify the 
setiathome client directory on the tkseti command line. For example:

	tkseti ~/setiathome

Make sure the user has write access to the setiathome directory!
