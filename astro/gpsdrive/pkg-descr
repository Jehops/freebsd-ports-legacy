GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) GPS navigation system.

GpsDrive displays the position provided from a NMEA-capable GPS receiver on
a zoomable map. The map file is autoselected depending on the position and
prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival" software is
running. Waypoint database is supported via mySQL (optional).
