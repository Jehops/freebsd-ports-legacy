GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) GPS navigation system.

GpsDrive displays the position provided from a Garmin or NMEA-capable GPS
receiver on a zoomable map. The map file is autoselected depending on
the position and prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival"
software is running. GpsDrive is written in C with use of the GTK-2 graphic
toolkit.
