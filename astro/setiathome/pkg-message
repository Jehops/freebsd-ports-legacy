****  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.%%PREFX%%setiathome%%SUFX%%.conf may be edited
      to tune some startup variables such as `seti_nice' defaulted to
      15 and `seti_maxprocs' defaulted to your number of processors.
****  NOTE: unlike previous versions, FreeBSD 5.x for i386 doesn't
      support a.out binaries by default.  To run setiathome, you have
      to add the following line to your kernel configuration file
      (/sys/i386/conf/<YOUR_KERNEL>) :
          options COMPAT_AOUT     # Enable i386 a.out binary support
