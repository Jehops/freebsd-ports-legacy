SETI@home is a scientific experiment that will harness the power of
hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected computers in the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).  You can participate by running a
program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data.  There's a
small but captivating possibility that your computer will detect the
faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth.

This package includes an interactive install script which allows you to
set up a working directory under /var/db/setiathome, register with or
log in to SETI@home, and arranges for setiathome to be started at
system start-up.  In this case, setiathome will be executed as user
`nobody'.

setiathome will run at nice level 1 by default, with a single process.
If you are running a SMP system and therefore would like to run one
process per CPU, or would like setiathome to run under another user ID,
you have to set it up manually.

setiathome requires about 0.5 MBytes disk space in its working
directory, and about 12 MBytes of memory.  If you have ample physical
memory, it's work load should be almost undetectable.

setiathome is a binary distribution currently available for FreeBSD
2.2.6, 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 3.1, and 4.0.  Newer versions of FreeBSD should be able
to run older binaries.
