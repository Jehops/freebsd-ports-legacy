.Sh NAME
.Nm setiathome
.Nd the SETI@home client program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the UNIX version of the 
.Tn SETI@home
client. It downloads radio telescope data from a network server, analyzes
the data looking for signals of extraterrestrial origin, and uploads results
to the server, repeating this cycle indefinitely. See
http://setiahome.ssl.berkeley.edu for more information.
.Pp
The first time you run
.Nm
it will interactively ask you for email address, name, country etc. This
info is stored in a file and no interaction is needed when you run the
program subsequently.
.Pp
After this you can run
.Nm
in the background, and direct its output to
.Pa /dev/null
if you like.
.Pp
.Nm
can be freely aborted and restarted. It saves its state in files,
and will pick up where it left off.
.Pp
.Nm
requires about 0.5\ MBytes of disk space in it's working directory, and about
12\ MBytes of memory. If you have ample physical memory, it's work load
should be almost undetectable.
.Pp
This port to FreeBSD includes a start-up script (usually found in
.Pa /usr/local/etc/rc.d/setiathome.sh )
that starts
.Nm
at system start-up. You can also use this script to set up a working
directory
.Pa ( /var/db/setiathome ) ,
and lets you register with or login to
.Tn SETI@home
by calling it with the argument
.Li register .
.Sh OPTIONS

.Pp
.Sh FILES
The program generates several files with 
.Pa .txt
extension in the directory from which it's run. These should not be
modified.
.Pp
If you want to run multiple instances of setiathome
(on a multiprocessor machine, or on multiple machines
that share a filesystem) each one must be run
in a different directory.
.Pp
setiathome uses a lock file 
.Pa ( lock.txt )
to prevent multiple instances from running in the same directory.
