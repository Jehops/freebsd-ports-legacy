SQueuer is a queueing proxy for Seti@Home with the following features:

	* Keeps a configurable sized queue of work units so that
	  the client will always be able to get a new work unit
	  immediately upon finishing one.

	* Queues results for uploading should the main Seti@Home
	  site be overloaded or down. Results are never lost and the
	  client is never delayed waiting to upload a result.

	* Can handle multiple users running the Seti@Home client
	  on multiple machines all connecting to SQueuer.

	* Platform independent. SQueuer has been tested and found
	  to work on different versions of Unix, MacOS and Windows.
	  All it requires is a Perl 5 interpreter.
