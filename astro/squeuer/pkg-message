=============================================================
To use SQueuer with the setiathome port, the file 

	/usr/local/etc/rc.setiathome.conf

must be modified (specifically the seti_proxy_server setting)
and setiathome restarted.

As an example, if you're running SQueuer on the same host as
the client then a line such as

	seti_proxy_server=localhost:17771

would be appropriate.  If SQueuer is running on a different
host or SQueuer is configured to run on a different port
then please modify either localhost or 17771 as appropriate.
