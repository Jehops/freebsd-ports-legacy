Ephem is a program that displays ephemerides for all the planets plus any
two additional objects.  The additional objects may be fixed or specified
via heliocentric elliptical, hyperbolic or parabolic orbital elements to
accommodate solar system objects such as asteroids or comets.

Unlike xephem, ephem works on a plain ascii terminal.
