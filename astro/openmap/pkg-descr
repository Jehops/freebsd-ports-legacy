OpenMapTM is a Java BeansTM based toolkit for building applications
and applets needing geographic information. Using OpenMap components,
you can access data from legacy applications, in-place, in a
distributed setting. At its core, OpenMap is a set of Swing components
that understand geographic coordinates. These components help you show
map data, and help you handle user input events to manipulate that
data.
