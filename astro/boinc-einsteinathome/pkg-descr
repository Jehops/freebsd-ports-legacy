Einstein@Home - Search for gravitational waves

Use your unused CPU cycles to aid in computations analyzing telescope
information for possible gravitational waves emitted by pulsars as
predicted by Albert Einstein.

Einstein@home is based on BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing).  Several other projects besides Einstein@home are
using BOINC.  BOINC lets you participate in more than one project,
and it lets you specify what fraction of your computer time should go
to each project.

Be sure to join the "FreeBSD" team on the Einstein website once you're
up and running.

The FreeBSD version of this client is currently in its beta-testing
phase.
