SETI - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence -- AstroPulse

The project listens for broad-band, short-time pulses that might represent
extraterrestial intelligence, or other phenomena such as rapidly rotating
pulsars or exploding primordial black holes.

The port automatically optimizes for the host CPU using the CPUTYPE
variable in /etc/make.conf

Currently it requires X to build, but at runtime X is only required for the
screen saver.  This requirement is an artifact of the current upstream design
of the port.
