The aim of the program is to make it as easy as possible for people to
do their own personal budgets and keep track of their finances. Using
this program you can:

	* Create a budget and organize budget items into categories.
	* Nominate budget items to be paid from either a cash account or
	  via a "Direct Debit" account which allows you to save for big
	  ticket items and ensure timely payment of scheduled bills.
	* Automatically calculates how much money you must put aside
	  each fortnight to meet all your "Direct Debit" obligations.
	* Automatically tells you how much money you must have in Direct
	  Debit account to meet your obligatory payments on any
	  particular date.
	* Record and save expenses against each of your budget categories.
	* Track how your expenses relate to your budget so you can
	  determine if you are over or under-spending in any of your
	  categories.
	* Sort your records into categories or by date.
	* Comes with realistic example to show how things work.
	* Allows you to export any of your reports, records, budget and
	  Direct Debit status to the Gnumeric Spreadsheet program where
	  they can be either printed or used for more detailed analysis.
	* Allows you to export any of your reports, records, budget and
	  Direct Debit status to the AbiWord WordProcessor program where
	  they can be printed or incorporated into a report.
