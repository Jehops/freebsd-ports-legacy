================================================================
BitcoinArmory consumes significant disk space in ~/.armory
and ~/.bitcoin, so you need to provide sufficient available
space there, currently >30 gigabytes.

Please note that BitcoinArmory has an embedded bitcoind, and
doesn't require the running bitcoind, but can optionally use it.

Please keep your *.wallet files located under the ~/.armory
directory secure. Loss of these files is equivalent to the loss
of money.
