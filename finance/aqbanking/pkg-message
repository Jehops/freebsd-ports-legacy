** IMPORTANT **

If you are upgrading from aqbanking-2.X or earlier, please note that the
per-user bank data directory has changed from ~/.banking to ~/.aqbanking.

Copy your existing online banking data to the new directory before
starting aqbanking or packages that use it, such as gnucash:

    cp -a ${HOME}/.banking ${HOME}/.aqbanking

Connections to some online-banking sites (e.g., Discover) with the
new aqbanking-3 may fail until you force use of SSLv3 with them:
gnucash users can use "Tools>Online Banking Setup" to edit the
specific "user" (i.e., institution) OFX configuration to set the
"Force SSLv3" flag.
