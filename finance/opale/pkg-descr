[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

Opale is a very simple personal bank account manager for KDE and
KOffice.  The precise specifications are opale should do what I
need.

I'm not releasing Opale in the hope it will be useful for anybody.
Of course I'll be glad if it ever is, but I'm mostly expecting you
to find Opale quite limited.  It should be easy to improve , though,
with new filters for example.  And I can help you if needed.
