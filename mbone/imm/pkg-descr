This is IMM, a program to send and receive images using IP multicast.
This program is currently in use on the MBONE to transmit semi-real-time
weather satellite images, as well as a number of other miscellaneous
pictures.  IMM requires X11R6 and either `xli' or `xv' to perform the
actual image display.
