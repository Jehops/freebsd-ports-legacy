Relate: Remote Language Teaching.

The integrated interface, which brings together the audio, video and
 shared workspace tools, has been designed to be as simple and easy
 to use as possible.
Particular emphasis has been given to reducing screen clutter and
 to minimising the number of things that need to be done
 to use the different parts of the software.
 There is minimal need to manipulate, move or uncover windows,
 and all necessary tools and controls are readily to hand.
Although basic keyboard and mouse skills are required,
 little else is needed for students and teachers to use the software.
