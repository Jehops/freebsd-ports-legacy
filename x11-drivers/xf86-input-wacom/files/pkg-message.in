To configure the driver with HAL just reattach the tablet for Xserver
to pick it up. Otherwise, use/edit the sample configuration file:

  $ cd %%PREFIX%%/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
  $ cp wacom.conf.sample wacom.conf

On xorg-server-1.7 and earlier you may need to also merge wacom.conf
into xorg.conf and add the following lines to ServerLayout section

	InputDevice	"wacom stylus"
	InputDevice	"wacom eraser"
	InputDevice	"wacom touch"
	InputDevice	"wacom pad"

moused(8) may interfere with tablet input by attaching to fake /dev/ums*.
To prevent that add a usb_quirk(4) then detach and attach the tablet.
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom is an example how preserve quirks across reboot.
