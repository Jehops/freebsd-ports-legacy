Videogen is a small and handy utility that generates XFree86 and/or fbset
(Linux framebuffer device) "Modelines" which tell your video card what
signals to send to your monitor.  Videogen is designed to provide the best
refresh rate your hardware supports, but if you do not want to drive your
monitor to the edge, just use lower specs than the actual capabilities of
your hardware.
