README for TkGoodStuff version 8.0-final, 1 Oct, 1997

TkGoodStuff for the X Window System is an alarm clock, biff, file
watcher, modem dialer/network status indicator, note-taker,
web-browser launch tool, system load monitor, application/utility
menu, Win95-like task bar, and whatever else you want.

TkGoodStuff produces a button bar.  It is easily configured and
modified with the on-line GUI preferences manager (*no* rc-file
hacking).  There is a "screen-edge" mode, in which the bar occupies an
edge of the screen, can be dragged to other edges, and can
auto-minimize (shrink to a line at the screen-edge).  For users of the
fvwm window manager (though tkgoodstuff works without fvwm),
tkgoodstuff serves all the functions of the Windows95 taskbar, and
then some.
