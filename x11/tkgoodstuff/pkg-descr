README for TkGoodStuff version 4.1, 2 Oct, 1996

TkGoodStuff for the X Window System is an alarm clock, biff, modem
dialer/network status indicator, note-taker, web-browser launch tool,
system load monitor, application/utility menu, Win95-like task bar,
and whatever else you want.

TkGoodStuff produces a button bar.  It is easily configured and
modified with the on-line GUI preferences manager (*no* rc-file
hacking).  The main envisioned use is as an always-on-top destop
utility to serve the user's common needs for indicators and buttons.
There is a "screen-edge" mode, in which the bar occupies an edge of
the screen, can be dragged to other edges, and can auto-minimize
(shrink to a line at the screen-edge).  For users of the fvwm window
manager (though tkgoodstuff works without fvwm), tkgoodstuff serves
all the functions of the Windows95 taskbar, and then some.

You can configure buttons to launch applications (with lots of
configurable options), you can "swallow" any application's window into
your tkgoodstuff panel, and several "clients" are included (you can
also write your own with a tcl/tk script---an example is provided):

        -- analog/digital alarm clock
        -- biff (check/scan/read new mail; handles multiple folders
           and alert levels, MH folders, IMAP mailboxes)
        -- PPP (or SLIP or TERM) net link GUI dialer and status
           indicator (with sophisticated redialing and login
           scripting).
        -- FVWM support, including Win95-like bar of buttons for open
           and iconified windows, as well as a pager.
        -- launcher for WWW browsers (lets you visit the URL in the
           current X selection with one click)
        -- note-taker (tool for quickly jotting down and organizing
           scraps of information)
        -- calendar/alarm support (for Ical-generated calendar files)
        -- system load monitor (graphical and/or digital display)
        -- Menu button, for launching applications and running
           utilities (the menu is GUI-configured).
        -- "webster" net dictionary client
        -- calculator with scrollable history and hex/dec/oct modes
           (perpetually alpha, until someone adopts it as a project!)
        -- POP/IMAP mail fetch scheduler.
        -- file watcher: look for changes in log files
        -- launcher for tkman (operates with X selection like WWW
           client)
