This is a port of ZClock, a simple but highly customizable clock applet for
the GNOME desktop environment. It allows you to display the time using a
POSIX strftime() format, and has many other useful options such as borders
and an uptime display in the tooltip. It is meant as a power-user replacement
for the standard GNOME clock applet.
