xscreensaver will run several programs to continuously update the
screen instead of going blank.  You can specify the programs and their 
arguments using resources.

It doesn't work very well with on my XF86_S3 with the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
extension, so it is disabled in config.h.

This is version 1.25.
