There is currently a conflict between configure for this port,
and pkgconfig. If your build fails, do the following:

make clean
pkg_delete -f pkgconfig*
make install

You may also want to upgrade your complete ports tree and
then re-install glib12 and gtk12 which will also fix the
pkg-config files for those two ports, and should offer a
more permanent solution.
