From the author's website:

GTK xset is a graphical frontend to the X command line tool xset(1).
It is a gtk application, designed with Glade. GTK xset can set auto
repeat, key click, bell, mouse, screen saver and DPMS parameters.
It also has a font path editor. GTK xset can save a xset command,
which restores all settings, to the file file ~/.xset.sh. This file
can be read from .xinitrc or other startup file.
