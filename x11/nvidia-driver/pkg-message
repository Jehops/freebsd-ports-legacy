To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the nvidia kernel
module, by doing

	# kldload nvidia

If you compile this package with WITH_FREEBSD_AGP=yes, you must load
the agp.ko kernel module *at boot time* by putting the following
line into your /boot/loader.conf:

	agp_load="YES"

or have your kernel compiled with "device agp".

Otherwise the nvidia kernel module will not load.

See ${PREFIX}/share/doc/NVIDIA/README for more information.
