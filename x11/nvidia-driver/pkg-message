The Nvidia driver has been updated to 367.35.  In this version of the driver,
some important functionality has been broken out into a separate
nvidia-modeset.ko.

Users that experience a hang starting X or observe

  [    43.243] (II) NVIDIA(0): Validated MetaModes:
  [    43.243] (II) NVIDIA(0):     "NULL"

in their Xorg.logs should replace 'nvidia.ko' with 'nvidia-modeset.ko' in their
loader.conf or rc.conf configurations.  (nvidia-modeset.ko has a MODULE_DEPENDS
relationship to nvidia.ko and will bring it in automatically.)
