XScoop provides the ability to quickly determine which underlying X libraries
were statically linked into an application, even when the source is not
available. XScoop parses an executable, looking for matches on a subset of
sample keywords that may identify the library being used. It does not produce
absolute results, and instead supplies a report with key-hits which represent
the likelihood that a particular library is present in the binary.
