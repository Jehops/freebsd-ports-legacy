GNOME version of xdm display manager

- This port doesn't work on the normal FreeBSD 3.x-RELEASEs because
  those pam is not stable.
  I'm sure this works on 5.0-current, and it may works on 4.x-RELEASE

  You should append those lines to your /etc/pam.conf

# gdm config
gdm     auth            requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     account         requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     session         required        pam_permit.so

- This port doesn't work with Japanese ( or some other ) environment.
  Try to set Language to Japanese. I don't know why but think there
  is something wrong around locale setting of libc/X/gtk/gdm.
