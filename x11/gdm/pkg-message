GDM is installed.

Please note the following:
- This port doesn't work on the normal FreeBSD 3.x-RELEASEs because
  PAM is not stable.
- This port has been tested on 5.0-CURRENT and 4.1.1-STABLE.
  4.x-RELEASE may or may not work.
- You should append these lines to your /etc/pam.conf, otherwise
  GDM will refuse all logins:

# gdm config
gdm     auth            requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     account         requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     session         required        pam_permit.so

- To enable GDM after booting, edit your /etc/ttys(5), and change the line
  for ttyv8 to

ttyv8   "/usr/X11R6/bin/gdm -nodaemon"  xterm   on
