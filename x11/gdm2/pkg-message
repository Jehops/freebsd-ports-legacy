GDM is installed.

Please note the following:
- This port has been tested on 5.0-CURRENT and 4.4-RELEASE and higher.
- If you are running a version of FreeBSD prior to 4.5-PRERELEASE, you should 
  append these lines to your /etc/pam.conf, otherwise GDM will refuse all 
  logins:

# gdm config
gdm     auth            requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     account         requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     session         required        pam_permit.so

- Do _NOT_ use /etc/ttys to start gdm at boot time.  This will result in gdm 
  hanging or restarting constantly.  Instead, copy the included gdm.sh.sample 
  script to gdm.sh, and restart.  This script is found, by default, in
  /usr/X11R6/etc/rc.d.
