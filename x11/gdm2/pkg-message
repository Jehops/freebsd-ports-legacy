GDM is installed.

Please note the following:
- This port has been tested on 5.0-CURRENT and 4.4-RELEASE and higher.
- If you are running a version of FreeBSD prior to 4.5-PRERELEASE, you should 
  append these lines to your /etc/pam.conf, otherwise GDM will refuse all 
  logins:

# gdm config
gdm     auth            requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     account         requisite       pam_unix.so     try_first_pass
gdm     session         required        pam_permit.so

- To enable GDM after booting, edit your /etc/ttys(5), and change the line
  for ttyv8 to

ttyv8   "/usr/X11R6/bin/gdm --nodaemon"  xterm   on
