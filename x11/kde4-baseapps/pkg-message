This package (kdebase2) installs a program called kcheckpass which is
used by kdm or screensavers to check the user's password.  This activity
requires it to be setuid root.  However, for security reasons, FreeBSD
leaves the setuid bit on this binary off by default, for several reasons.
First, some people may not use screensavers or kdm at all.  Second,
others may choose to use a different screensaver or display manager
utility.  And finally, there may be holes in kcheckpass which can be
exploited to gain root privileges.  FreeBSD chooses not to take that risk
with the default package.  If you decide that you need it setuid root,
you can make it so:

	chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/bin/kcheckpass

..where ${PREFIX} is the prefix where this package was installed.  It is
typically /usr/local but may also be /usr/X11R6 or /usr.
