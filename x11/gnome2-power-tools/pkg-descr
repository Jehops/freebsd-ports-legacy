GNOME 2 Power Tools

Power Tools is every GNOME geek's Batbelt.  It fills the gap between the
core GNOME Desktop, which tries to be a relevant set of modules for all
users; and the Fifth Toe, which is the collection of the coolest and most
useful GNOME applications.

This collection consists of utilities and applets for the technically-minded
GNOME user.  It also contains many useful add-on utilities for some of the
applications found in the Desktop and Fifth Toe.
