trayer-srg was forked from trayer in january 2010 to add some
fancy features and clean up code.

trayer is small program designed to provide systray functionality
present in GNOME/KDE desktop enviroments for window managers
which doesn't support that function. It's similar to other
applications such as 'peksystray' and 'docker'.

trayer code was extracted from fbpanel application, you can find more
about it on it's homepage
