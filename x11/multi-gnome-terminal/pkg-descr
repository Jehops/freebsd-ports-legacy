Multi Gnome Terminal is an enhanced version of gnome-terminal which has 
the following features added: 

    - Many terminals in each window 
    - Switch between terminals using shortcuts 
    - Execution of user defined commands in new terminals 
    - Notification of terminal states (changed, changing, unchanged) using 
      different tabs colors
    - Reorderable tabs 

All these extensions are inspired by screen and konsole (the kde2 terminal).
