wmblob is a useless program, showing moving blobs. It's a nice dockapp
for Window Maker (www.windowmaker.org), and it may run with other
window mangers.

How to use it:

  Just start it.  There are no command line options.  You can change
  the colors with the three mouse button.

    - Left button: changes the inner color of the blobs.
    - Middle button: changes the border color of the blobs.
    - Right button: changes the background color.

  There are 16 colors available.  But not every combination looks
  good.
