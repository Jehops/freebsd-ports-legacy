				ATTENTION:

Due to a BSD related bug in aterm in some cases the $COLUMNS and $LINES
envirement variables are not being updated to the corresponding window geometry
values. This will cause problems with applications such as 'man' or 'ee'. You
need to adjust the window geometry manually at least once in order for the two
envirement variable mentioned above to get adjusted correctly.

The AfterStep/aterm developers know about this problem and are working on it.
