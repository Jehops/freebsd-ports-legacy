The XfApplet Plugin is a plugin for the Xfce 4 Panel which allows one to use
applets designed for the Gnome Panel inside the Xfce Panel. You can think of
XfApplet as a tiny Gnome Panel that lives inside the Xfce Panel and allows
you to show the same applets that the Gnome Panel is capable of showing.
