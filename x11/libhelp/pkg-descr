Libhelp is a comprehensive hypertext-help-system for OSF/Motif(tm)
applications which uses    the html widget  from   NCSA Mosaic(tm)
version 2.4. The help  browser provides hypertext links, different
fonts, inlined images  and a lot of more  elements  known from www
(world wide web)     browsers.  It has  a   document   history and
implements buffer and image cache methods.

Libhelp  provides  two interface functions   for  getting help and
setting resources.  It eases  the task of writing  the application
help. Menu and context  sensitive   help are supported.   Lowlevel
Motif and X stuff is hidden from the application developer (and of
course the user too). Libhelp works with (at least) ansi-c and c++
applications.
