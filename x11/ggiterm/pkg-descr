GGIterm is an ANSI-compatible terminal emulator (like xterm, rxvt,
gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.), but directed at LibGGI rather than
X11. This means that, unlike most terminal emulators, it can run on a
KGGI, SVGAlib, or other non-X target just as well as under X11.

GGIterm uses freetype (by default) to render fonts, which means that
you can use TT, Type 1, etc. fonts on your terminal.

At present, it's not complete--you probably don't want to replace
gnome-terminal or konsole yet under X, and it's only barely been
tested on other targets. But it works.
