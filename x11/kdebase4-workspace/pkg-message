This port has installed fonts into %%PREFIX%%/share/fonts

You'll have to add %%PREFIX%%/share/fonts
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ %%PREFIX%%/share/fonts
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/X11/XF86Config or %%X11BASE%%/lib/X11/XF86Config) and
restarting the X-server.

You also have to make the new path known to fontconfig by
adding a 

<dir>%%PREFIX%%/share/fonts</dir> line to either

%%X11BASE%%/etc/fonts/local.conf or ~/.fonts.conf and running

fc-cache -f (as root if you edited local.conf) afterwards.
