************************************************************

The GNOME 2 desktop Lite edition has been successfully installed.

The Lite edition does not include all the components of the standard 
GNOME 2 desktop as detailed at http://www.gnome.org.  If you wish to
install the full desktop, you can remove this port, and install the
x11/gnome2 port or package.  Alternatively, you can install additional
GNOME components individually using either their ports or packages.

For more help on using GNOME on FreeBSD, please see the FreeBSD GNOME project
site at http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome.
