************************************************************

The GNOME 2 desktop Lite edition has been successfully installed.

The Lite edition does not include all the components of the standard
GNOME 2 desktop as detailed at http://www.gnome.org.  If you wish to
install the full desktop, you can remove this port, and install the
x11/gnome2 port or package.  That can be best accomplished using
the following commands:

# pkg_delete gnome2-lite
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make install clean

Alternatively, you can install additional GNOME components individually
using either their ports or packages.

For more help on using GNOME on FreeBSD, please see the FreeBSD GNOME project
site at http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome.
