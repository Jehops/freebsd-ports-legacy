Simple command line version of compression program using LZMA compression
method. This program is taken from LZMA SDK. 7-zip uses the same compression
method, but creates 7Z archives instead of pure LZMA data stream. LZMA can
compress and decompress data streams using standard input/output.

Compression ratio is about 25-30% better than bzip2 and decompression speed
is about two times faster. This makes LZMA good bzip2 replacement for
use in software distribution.
