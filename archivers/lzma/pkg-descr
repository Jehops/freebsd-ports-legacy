Simple command line implementation of LZMA compression algorithm. This tool
uses raw LZMA format as opposed to 7z container format, which uses LZMA as
the default compression algorithm, but has many additional features and a
header incompatible to that of raw LZMA streams. If you need to create
highly-compatible archives, you probably want to use archivers/p7zip port.
Lzma tool is taken from LZMA SDK.

Compression ratio is about 25-30% better than bzip2 and decompression speed
is about two times faster. The downside is higher CPU and RAM requirements
for compression.
