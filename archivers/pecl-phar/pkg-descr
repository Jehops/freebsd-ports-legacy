The phar extension provides the phar stream wrapper and the Phar
class for manipulating self-contained PHP Archive (phar) files.
The Phar class can be used to create and to extract contents of
phar files as well as iterating over their contents.

PHP Archive files (Phars) are special collections of files that
can be transparently run right out of the file, similar to Java's
jar archive files. Using a phar archive, it is possible to distribute
a complete PHP application in a single file that will run out of the
file without modification or extraction.
