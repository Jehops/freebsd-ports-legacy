The program wzip is a preprocessor for lossy data compression. A sequence of
ASCII floating-point numbers is transformed into a sequence of small integers
ready for effective compression with e.g. gzip.  The program can also be used
for effective but time consuming denoising of measurement data.  Wzip was
originally written for the processing of EDX-linescans.
