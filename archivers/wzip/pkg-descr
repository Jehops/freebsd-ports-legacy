The program wzip is a preprocessor for lossy data compression. A
sequence of ascii floating-point numbers is transformed into a
sequence of small integers ready for effective compression with e.g.
gzip. The program can also be used for effective but time consuming
denoising of measurement data. Wzip was originally written for the
processing of EDX-linescans.

wzip is originally written for inclusion into the Debian GNU/Linux system.
