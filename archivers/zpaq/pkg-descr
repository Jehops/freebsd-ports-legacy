ZPAQ is a journaling, incremental, deduplicating archiver for Windows and
Unix.  "Journaling" means that when you update a file or directory, both the
old and new versions are saved.  You can extract from the archive as it
existed at any time in the past.

"Incremental" means that when you back up your entire hard drive, only those
files whose last-modified date has changed since the previous backup are
added.  For 100 GB of files, this typically takes 1-2 minutes, vs. few hours
to create the first version.

"Deduplicating" means that identical files or fragments are stored only once
to save time and space.

Files are compressed in the open standard ZPAQ format, which is supported by
a specification, reference decoder, and a test case (which should decode to
the Calgary corpus), and a public domain C++ API that provides compression
and decompression services.  The format is not known to be encumbered by any
patents.  ZPAQ stores the decompression algorithm description in the archive,
which means that when archive is updated to a better compression algorithm,
older extractors will still be able to read the new archives.
