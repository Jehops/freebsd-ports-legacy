Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver. Star
development started 1982, development is still in progress. The
current version is stable.

Main advantages over other tar implementations:
	fifo			- keeps the tape streaming.
	pattern matcher		- for a convenient user interface
	sophisticated diff	- user tailorable interface for comparing tar 
				  archives against file trees
	no namelen limitation	- Pathnames up to 1024 Bytes may be archived.
	deals with all 3 times	- stores/restores all 3 times of a file
	does not clobber files	- more recent copies on disk will not be 
				  clobbered from tape
	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives
	automatic format detect	- automatically detects archive formats:
				  Old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star.
	fully ansi compatible	- Star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
