In addition to the manpages, see %%DOCSDIR%%/readme_*.txt and the
comments at the head of %%DOCSDIR%%/*.cpp for instructions and
details on usage and the algorithms employed.  For simplicity, the
".exe" suffix has been retained for temporary executables used with
the zpaq "o" flag, and optimized pzpaq decompression.  However, the
suffix has been dropped from the zpsfx self-expanding archive stub
executable, to avoid confusion with win32 executable stubs. zpsfx
can be further compressed with archivers/upx, to yield smaller
self-expanding archives.
