p7zip is a port of 7z.exe and 7za.exe for Unix.

7z and 7za are command line version of 7-zip, see http://www.7-zip.org/.

7-Zip is a file archiver with highest compression ratio.

Currently, p7zip (like 7-zip) supports only little-endian machine.

7z uses shared libraries and supports more archive formats, otherwise
7z and 7za work the same.  They didn't come with a manpage, html
commandline documentation will be installed in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/p7zip/
