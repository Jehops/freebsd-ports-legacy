    Put the libarchive detection calls before configure_file().

    The generated config.h was using some variables defined only after
    plugins/CMakeLists.txt called macro_optional_find_package(LibArchive),
    however the top-level CMakeLists.txt relied on these variables already
    being set, which was never the case.

    BUG: 271553
    FIXED-IN: 4.6.4
