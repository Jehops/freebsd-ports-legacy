epkg is a package manager which uses the Encap Package Management System, a
method for flexibly handling installation and management of third-party
software on a Unix system. Encap places each package in its own subdirectory,
then automatically manages symlinks to their appropriate places in /usr/local.
The Encap package format includes features like postinstall scripts and
prerequisite checking. Other features include builtin tar/gzip extraction,
optional builtin FTP and HTTP support, transaction logging, and the ability to
automatically upgrade a package to the latest version.
