This is LHa for Unix, version 1.01u.  This is an unofficially patched
version (hence `u') of LHa 1.00, which was posted around 1 Apr 92 to
fj.sources and reposted by me to alt.sources on 24 Apr 92.

I also posted to alt.sources on 24 April an unofficial patch to allow
the use of default .lzh extensions.  Tom Kloos then sent me on 2 May a
patch to extend the use of special permissions, restore the UID and GID,
etc. (see below); Jean-Pierre Radley sent on 26 June a patch which sets
default .lzh extensions much more elegantly and reliably than mine (also
see below).  Finally, I fixed bugs in Tom's chown() patch and in util.c
(the latter causing compilation errors on a SysV machine).  All of the
patches in my possession have now been integrated into these sources 
and tested to some extent (as of 23 Sep 92).  The original sources may 
be regenerated by reverse-patching the context diff file "lha101u.dif".

Please note that this is the limit of my involvement with this program.
If you find problems or have subsequent patches, I would appreciate
hearing about them, but distributing them is up to you.  I do not know
enough about LHa to offer compilation help or debugging suggestions,
either; contact the LHa authors at the address given in "readme.eng"
for that.
