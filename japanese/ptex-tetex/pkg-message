=== IMPORTANT NOTICE ===

 - The standard texmf.cnf for pTeX is installed into
   texmf/web2c/ptex/texmf.cnf and this is used by default.
   Do not edit it directly; instead put the file to
   texmf-local/web2c/ptex/texmf.cnf and edit it if you want
   to customize it.

 - Japanized versions of "pltotf" and "tftopl" are installed
   as "pltotf-ptex" and "tftopl-ptex".

 - pLaTeX2e is now based on LaTeX2e as of 2003/12/01.
