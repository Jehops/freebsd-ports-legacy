Lookup is a search interface to electronic dictionaries within Emacs.
You can use various sources (such as CD-ROM books, dictionary server on
the network, and so on) as dictionaries by the simple operation.

This is the release of Lookup version 1.0.  It works on GNU Emacs
19.28 or later, XEmacs 20.3 or later, Mule 2.3, and Meadow 1.0 or later.

NOTE: This package is a "meta-port" to depend on bitmap-emacs20 and
ja-lookup-mule.
