Kinput2 is an Japanese text input server for X11 applications.

A client that require kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port supports Canna and Wnn7(temporary).

(NOTICE)
Default key-binding is changed to "egg" key-binding by defining
*CcWnn.ccdef:           ccdef.kinput2.egg
in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/X11/app-defaults/Kinput2.

Note: 	Current wnn7 support on kinput2 is done by backward-compatibility
	with wnn6, and you need to add following line to ${WNNENVRC}
	file or /usr/local/lib/wnn7/ja_JP/wnnenvrc:

	boin_kabusoku FALSE
