This port is for a printer filter of EPSON PM-3500C. The filter is
called Photo Image Print System for Linux and there exist the filters
for other EPSON bubble jet printers. By using this driver you can
print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the below

And then this port has a modified filter "filter3500.rev" which is
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it, you add the
next entries into /etc/printcap.
