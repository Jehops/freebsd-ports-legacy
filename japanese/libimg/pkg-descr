"Img" package enhances Tk, adding support for many other Image formats:
BMP, XBM, XPM, GIF (with transparency), PNG, JPEG, TIFF and
postscript. This version only works with Tcl/Tk 8.0 or higher
(tested up to Tk8.1b2). If you are using Tk4.2 or lower,
stick with Img1.1.4 (which is still available).

Note that both graphics/img and japanese/img are mutually exclusive and 
SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED SIMULTANEOUSLY!
