This is the Japanese manual.  Note that to build it, you need the
source to be on your machine, in which case you can build and install
it by just going to /usr/opt/doc/ja/man and typing
"make all install".  (It will also be built automatically if you have
DOC_LANG set to "ja" or have ALLLANG set to anything during a "make 
world".)

In other words, this pretty useless as a port, but is here so I can
build a package.
