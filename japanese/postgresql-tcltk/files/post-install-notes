You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the

If you understand Japanese, you might want to visit:

to subscribe a local mailing list for Japanese speakers.

If you build PostgreSQL with TCL support, then you can use the
TCL/TK based database frontend "pgaccess" for database operations.
