GP (GUI Printer) is a printing tool on X-Window with Tcl/Tk
interactively without any attention to the filetypes or the
printernames in the printcap. 

  Using a PostScript printer on GP, you have to name the printer "ps" 
in the printcap.

To change the printer information or the associated printer with
filetypes, edit the following two files:

	/usr/local/etc/GP/printer
	/usr/local/etc/GP/filetype

  For more information, see the files in the "/usr/local/share/doc/GP" 
directory.
