GP (GUI Printer) is a printing tool on X-Window with Tcl/Tk  
interactively without any attention to the filetypes or the  
printernames in the printcap.                                
                                                             
  Using a PostScript printer on GP, you have to name the     
printer "ps" in the printcap.                                
                                                             
To change the printer information or the associated printer  
with filetypes, edit the following two files:                
                                                             
        /usr/local/lib/GP/printer                            
        /usr/local/lib/GP/filetype                           
                                                             
  For more information, see the files in the                 
"/usr/local/share/doc/GP"  directory.
