Rxvt is an xterm replacement which uses a little less memory, and is 
suitable for use on machines with small memories. Tek4010 support
is removed.

Modifications were made by Rob Nation (nation@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com) 
to make it a little more compact, and to add and remove certain features.

This supports Japanese input with X Input Method (XIM) Protocol.
Supported input styles are `OverTheSpot' and `Root'.  The patch is
contributed from Nobutaka Mantani <nobutaka@nobutaka.com>.  More
