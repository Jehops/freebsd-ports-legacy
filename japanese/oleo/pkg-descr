This is a port of the spreadsheet program oleo, with Japanese support by Kuniaki
HAYASHIDA.  Documentation in Japanese is in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/oleo/ja_JP.EUC/USING.eucJP (usually
/usr/local/share/doc/oleo/ja_JP.EUC/USING.eucJP).

If the environment variable LANG is set to C under X11 client mode, as:
		setenv LANG C
		setenv DISPLAY localhost:0.0
when starting oleo, X11 will consume too much memory to operate X clients.  To
avoid this problem, you can either set LANG to ja_JP.EUC instead (in which case
you also need the /usr/share/locale/ja_JP.EUC/LC_TIME,LC_COLLATE file), or unset
the DISPLAY environment variable so oleo does not use X.

Output to a PostScript file has some problems.

The default editing mode is like Emacs (Ctrl-h is call help mode).  If you want
to use Ctrl-h and BS key to delete-char, set to $HOME/.oleorc as below:
	bind-key generic-main backward-delete-char ^H
