This is pTeX, TeX system with Japanese support.

This system is based on teTeX 1.0.7 which contains TeX, LaTeX2e, and
various other TeX related programs.  

By installing this package, pTeX uses JIS for output to terminal and
log files.  JIS and EUC can be used in input files.

Note: Some of the features provided by teTeX may not work with
Japanese language, even though The TeX and LaTeX2e are able to handle
Japanese.  Use ptex and platex respectively.)

Note: xdvi and dvips, which are part of teTeX package, are not
included in this packages since they are not localized for Japanese.
Use corresponding ports/packages in the japanese category.
