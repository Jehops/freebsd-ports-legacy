kterm is a xterm replacement with Japanese (Kanji) support.  It also
understands ANSI color sequences.  This version is 6.1.0, available
from the X11R6 contrib tape.

Also included is support for Xaw3d arrow-style scrollbars.  You can
now hold down the arrow buttons to scroll continuously.  I made this
patch (patch-ae) by modifying the source while looking at the xterm
patch available with Xaw3d for R5.
