Mnews, Mini News Reader, is a small size news reader to handle news
and electronic mail messages.

Goals of mnews' development are small size, fast operation and easy to
use interface.

As far as the size is concerned, both the program itself and the
memory usage are much smaller than those of emacs+gnus or vin.

We believe the speed of the program is also one of the fastest among
other news readers.  (Though, we added various functions and they are
making the program a bit slower.)

Most effort was put on making mnews easy to operate.  Most of the
message from the program is in Japanese, the operation is easy to
learn for both former gnus users and former vin users (basically, it's
Gnus compatible), and discarded multi-keystroke operations.

MH, UCB mail and rmail style e-mail files can be handled with mnews.
Optionally, you can build a electronic bulletin board system.
(FreeBSD's package does not include the support for this function by
default, so you need to rebuild mnews using the files in the port
collection if you wish to use the feature.)

Also, MIME encoded headers using ISO-2022-JP can be handled.
