This is a package containing only the executables for xemacs-21.1.6, the
next generation of Emacs.

You need to install a package, xemacs-common-21.1.6, containing emacs
lisp files, info pages, and so on (except executables) for
xemacs-21.1.6.

This package is built with Japanese support by using Canna or SJ3 as
an external input engine. If you use with SJ3, you should be installed 
sj3serv in advance. SKK is supported as already builtin. Also it will
support several input methods under leim. 

This package and the package xemacs-common-21.1.6, might clobber any
existing emacs installation.  In particular, the executables and man
pages of etags/ctags are installed, and the info pages that come with
the original emacs will be overwritten too.

Although this shouldn't cause any problems to run both mule and emacs,
it may cause some confusion when one of them is pkg_delete'd.  If
someone has a solution to this, please tell me.
Or to avoid this problem, you could select prefix for top install
directory. By default it is pointed to the usual place, /usr/local.
