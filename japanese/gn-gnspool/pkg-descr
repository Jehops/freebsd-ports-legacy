This is gn-1.35, a simple newsreader with local spooling support.

gn is a small newsreader with NNTP support.  
It is especially designed for beginners with easy-to-understand interface.

The attached utility "gnspool" makes gn different from other newsreaders.
gnspool fetches news articles from a NNTP server and stores them locally.
You can read, follow and reply to the articles when you are not connected.
gnspool stores replied/followed messages also, and post them in the next
connection.  This feature is greatly useful to save your connection fee.
gnspool feature is available to other newsreaders like mnews or gnus also.
