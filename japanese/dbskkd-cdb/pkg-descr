dbskkd-cdb is a dictionary server for the SKK Japanese input method
system.  dbskkd-cdb is based on the code of skkserv (the original SKK
server) 3.9.3, using the cdb constant database package of
D. J. Bernstein (DJB) for faster dictionary access.

dbskkd-cdb is compatible with skkserv on the protocol behavior.  It is
called from "super-server" programs such as inetd or tcpserver, and the
I/O operation is solely with the stdio interface, so the code is compact
and the access to the server can be easily restricted.
