Note for inetd users:

Add following line to /etc/inetd.conf
   skkserv stream tcp nowait root ${PREFIX}/libexec/dbskkd-cdb dbskkd-cdb

If dbskkd-cdb 1.01 was running, please update your /etc/inetd.conf line.

Also note that dbskkd-cdb should run as root (not 'nobody' as of 1.01),
since it chroot(8)s to the default dictionary directory, ${PREFIX}/share/skk.
