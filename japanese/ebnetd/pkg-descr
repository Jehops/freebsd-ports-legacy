NDTPD is a server for accessing CD-ROM books with NDTP (Network
Dictionary Transfer Protocol) on TCP.  You can replace dserver with
NDTPD.  NDTPD can run on UNIX derived systems.  It supports CD-ROM
books of EB, EBG, EBXA, EBXA-C, S-EBXA and EPWING formats.  CD-ROM
books of those formats are popular in Japan.  Since CD-ROM books
themseves are stands on the ISO 9660 format, you can mount the discs
by the same way as other ISO 9660 discs.

In addition, you must follow the licenses of your CD-ROM books.
Though NDTPD is free software, your books may not be free.  Don't
open your books to unlicensed hosts nor users.

You can get information about NDTPD from their website.
