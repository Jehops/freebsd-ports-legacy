* How to use Interviews / idraw

    Binary files are installed to ${prefix}/interviews/bin directory.
  Please add ${prefix}/interviews/bin to your path variable.

    For example (with csh or tcsh):
		% set path = ( $path /usr/local/interviews/bin )
		% rehash
		% kinput2 &
		% idraw

    Enjoy!!
