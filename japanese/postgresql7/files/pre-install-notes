 * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE *

The PostgreSQL port now obeys hier(7) by default, which means that it
installs into:

%%PREFIX%%/bin
%%PREFIX%%/lib
%%PREFIX%%/include/pgsql

You *must* move away your old installation to avoid problems with
ldconfig(8) and user's PATH:s. If you rather install using the
old-fashion layout, cancel at next screen and run make as:

$ make -DWITH_OLD_LAYOUT

As always, you *must* dump existing databases before stopping and
removing your old postgresql, as part of the update.  This is *NOT*
done by this port!

If you want JAVA support, I will try to determine your JAVA_HOME using
javavmwrapper. If you want a different JVM, please set JAVA_HOME.
