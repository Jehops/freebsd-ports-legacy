is missing the "pw" utility.  We need this utility.  Please get and
install it, and try again.  You can get the source from:

This system already has an account whose name is '$id_70' and ID number is 70.

   '`id $id_70`'

For PostgreSQL in this port or package, UID:GID of '${PGSQL_UID}' has to be 70:70.
Please try again after you delete the account.
