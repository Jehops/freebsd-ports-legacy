Pine for FreeBSD 2.x is a tool for reading, sending, and managing
electronic messages.  It was designed specifically with novice
computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the needs
of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols (e.g.
RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix and PCs.  This
package also includes the Pico editor, the IMAP daemon, a POP2 server, 
and a POP3 server.

This version supports kanji input using Canna.  Canna can be started
by ^@ (or ctrl-space) in the Pico editor.

Note: Users are strongly encouraged to install pine4 package instead,
since pine 3 is known to contain security problems, as well as pine
4.x supports Japanese.  However, pine3 with Japanese support provides
help files in Japanese and the pico editor supports input using Canna.
