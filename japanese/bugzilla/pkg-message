  Bugzilla has now been installed.  To quick setup you have to:

  1. Create database user who has rights on bugs database manipulation
     by following mysql commands:

     GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,INDEX,ALTER,CREATE,DROP,REFERENCES,\
	   LOCK TABLES ON <database>.* TO <dbuser>@<host> \
	   IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

     where <database> is a bugs database name; <dbuser> is a bugs database
           owner; <host> is a host there bugzilla is being setup;
           <password> is a database owner's password;

  2. Change working directory to %%PREFIX%%/%%BUGZILLADIR%%
  3. Run "./checksetup.pl" script as root user
  4. Read output carefully and follow all instructions

  For more complete database setup and post-installation instructions
