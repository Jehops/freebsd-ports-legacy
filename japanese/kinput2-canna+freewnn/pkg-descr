Kinput2 is an Japanese text input server for X11 applications.

A client that require kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port supports Canna and FreeWnn.

*CcWnn.ccdef:           ccdef.kinput2.egg
in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/X11/app-defaults/Kinput2.
