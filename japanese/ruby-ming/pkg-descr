Ming/Ruby is yet another implementation of Ming embedding for Ruby
extension library without SWIG. Ming/Ruby also supports JaMing which
is an improvement of Ming to display Japanese characters and to play
sounds. To use Japanese fonts with JaMing, the letters must be
followed the UTF-8 formats. Uconv, which is an UTF-8 extension library
for Ruby, can be used to convert other Kanji encodings into Unicode.
