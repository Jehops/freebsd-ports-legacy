Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt
is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.

This is japanized version.
