This system has an 'wnn' account whose ID number is $id_wnn.  It seems
that Wnn4.2 has been already installed.  For Wnn6 in this ports or
package, ID number of 'wnn' has to be 69.  So we do the following two
things:

1) You should delete the account.

2) It seems that all of files or directories for Wnn4.2 are in
    ${PKG_PREFIX}/lib/wnn and ${PKG_PREFIX}/bin.  You should change these ID
    number from '$id_wnn' to '69'.

    Notice: After doing 1) and 2), we will create a new 'wnn' account
	    whose ID number is '69'.
