This is a port of 'Wnn6 for Linux/FreeBSD', a Japanese input
method. 'Wnn6' is not free.

Note that 'Wnn6 for Linux/FreeBSD' is an old version, and you can
buy a newer version from Omron Software Co., Ltd. The newer Wnn6 is a
package-style for FreeBSD, so you can pkg_add it directly. That is, it
is not necessary to use this port if yours is the newer version.
