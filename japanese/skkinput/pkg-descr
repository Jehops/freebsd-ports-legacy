Skkinput is an input method for X11 applications that want Japanese
text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to skkinput.  Skkinput receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port was done by Murata Shuuichirou <mrt@mickey.ai.kyutech.ac.jp>.
It requires skk server.
