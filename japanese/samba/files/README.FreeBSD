   it.
2. Copy /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh.sample to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh
3. Type /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh or reboot.

See document files in /usr/local/share/doc/samba and example config files in
/usr/local/share/examples/samba for details.

Samba Japanese Edition is based on Samba 2.0.9, implemented the experimental
internationalized SWAT and fixed several problems arond functions for
Japanese support. See smb.conf.sample for details. If you want to use
NT4+SP3 or Win95+updates clients, set "encrypt passwords" parameter to
yes and use smbpasswd [username] to use /usr/local/private/smbpasswd
for authentication.
