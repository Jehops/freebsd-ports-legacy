This is a source release of the Xvi editor (derived from "STEVIE"), a
clone of the UNIX editor `vi'. The program was originally developed
for the Atari ST, but has been ported to UNIX, MS-DOS, OS/2 and QNX as
well.

Xvi is a portable multi-window version of `vi'. In spite of its name,
there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific version of it, but work is
still in progress. Existing versions use text windows separated by
horizontal status lines on character mode displays.  The windows may
represent different files being edited, or different views on to the
same file.
