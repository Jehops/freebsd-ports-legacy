Esecanna-vje listens to canna clients as cannaserver, 
interprets to the VJE-Delta server what they say, and
passes what it results to them.

With this, you can use VJE-Delta's smart input engine
also from the console applications.

	[   Canna clients  ] (mule, jvim, etc.)
	      ||    /\
	      \/    ||
	[   esecanna-vje   ] (esecannaserver)
	      ||    /\
	      \/    ||
	[ VJE-Delta server ] (vjed)

Before running esecannaserver, don't forget to stop
the "real" cannaserver, if running.
