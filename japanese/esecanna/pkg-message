************************************************************
NOTE THAT THIS VERSION IS A VERY DEVELOPMENT RELEASE.

First of all, never forget to read the documents located in
/usr/local/share/doc/esecanna carefully. When and if you
meet with any problem or strange behavior, please refer to
the debug log stored in /var/log/esecannaserver.log or
output to stderr if run by hand, and report it immediately
to the author of esecanna, or the maintainer of the port.

Thank you for understanding.

* Using VJE-Delta 3.0 trial, esecannaserver will fail to
* connect to vjed before once you run vje.

Quick Setup:
  Run /usr/local/etc/rc.d/vjeesecannaserver.sh as root.
  Each user may want to configure the behavior by editing
  `~/.esecannarc', copied after `/usr/local/etc/esecannarc'.
