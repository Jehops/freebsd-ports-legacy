Kinput2 is an Japanese text input server for X11 applications.

A client that require kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port supports Canna, SJ3 and FreeWnn.  Those looking for egg-key-binding
other than default binding, try as follows:

	% kinput2 -ccdef ccdef.kinput2.egg
