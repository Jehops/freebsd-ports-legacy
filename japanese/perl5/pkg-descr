----------- From lang/perl5/pkg/DESC
From the distribution README:

Perl is a language that combines some of the features of C, sed, awk
and shell.  See the manual page for more hype.  There are also two Nutshell
Handbooks published by O'Reilly & Assoc.  See pod/perlbook.pod
for more information.

This port will not work on FreeBSD 2.0, nor will it work on earlier snapshots.
This is due to a bug in vprintf in the C library.
