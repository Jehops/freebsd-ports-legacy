This is mule-2.3, a multilingual editor based on emacs-19.28.

This package is built with Japanese support, using Canna as default.

This package *will* clobber any existing emacs installation.  In
particular, the executables and man pages of etags/ctags are
installed, and the info pages that come with the original emacs get
installed too.

Although this shouldn't cause any problems to run both mule and emacs,
it may cause some confusion when one of them is pkg_delete'd.  If
someone has a solution to this, please tell me.

Also, it will overwrite itself over another mule using SJ3 and/or Wnn.
Solutions to this is welcome, too.

A "dir" file is supplied in the files/ subdirectory of the ports
package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info to read mule info pages,
but also make sure you also add everything that may have been added to
that file!
