******************************************************************************
This program requires some japanese virtual fonts. For that purpose,
you can install `ja-makejvf-fkr-1.0' or `ja-vftool-1.2' package.

Configuration file is /usr/local/share/texmf/dvips/base/config.ps
In this configuration, it is possible to do convert them to 
PDF file through ghostscript, then read by Adobe Acrobat to perform
`cut and paste' of English fonts.  If you don't like this behavior
(i.e. You want to embed bitmap information of english fonts; cut and 
      paste becomes impossible),  delete or comment following two lines:
p +psfonts.cmz
p +psfonts.amz
