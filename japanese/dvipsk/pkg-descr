Dvipsk converts a DVI file produced by TeX (or other program) to
a PostScript file. Missing fonts can be automatically generated if
METAFONT exists on the system, or can be converted from `gf' to `pk'
format on demand. Dvips also supports `tpic', `psfig', `emtex',
and `METAPOST'.

Configuration file is /usr/local/share/texmf/dvips/base/config.ps
In this configuration, it is possible to do convert them to 
PDF file through ghostscript, then read by Adobe Acrobat to perform
`cut and paste' of English fonts.  If you don't like this behavior
(i.e. You want to embed bitmap information of english fonts; cut and 
      paste becomes impossible),  delete or comment following two lines:
p +psfonts.cmz
p +psfonts.amz
