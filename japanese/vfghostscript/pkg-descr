This is  ghostscript 2.6.2 with Japanese & VFlib-2.x patch.
With this package you can see PostScript file on X11 Window System and 
print out by your printer.

Check before using Ghostscript:

Make sure that your vfontcap is well configured.
  This package expects by default that 'vfontcap' file contains KANJI entry for:
	min -  Entry for Mincho
	goth - Entry for Gothic .

  You can verify that font name min and goth are available by typing:
  /usr/local/lib/VFlib/ktest -f min
  /usr/local/lib/VFlib/ktest -f goth

Note: These KANJI entry can be changed to another name by changing 
/usr/local/lib/ghostscript/kanji/kconfig.ps (kanji/vflib.ps is the original),
but the name must be consistent in both 'vfontcap' file and 'kconfig.ps' file.
See /usr/local/lib/ghostscript/doc/gs261j.jis for details.
