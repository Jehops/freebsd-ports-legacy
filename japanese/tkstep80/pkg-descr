This is Tk 8.0  with some modifications to make it look like N*XTSTEP's 
interface, plus some new widgets inspirated on N*XTSTEP. 
It also incorporates the DND drag and drop patches (see README.TkDND)

You can use TkSTEP with WindowMaker or AfterStep to make your desktop look
more consistent. BowMan is a window manager that emulates the look and feel
of the N*XTSTEP user interface. AfterStep is a continuation of BowMan with
many enhancements and is event better looking. WindowMaker is a even better
WindowManager by Alfredo Kojima.
