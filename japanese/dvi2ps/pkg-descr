DVI to PostScript converter.

A sample font description file `/usr/local/lib/dvi2ps/fontdesc' is installed.
Those who want to print out English fonts by pkfont and Japanese by 
printer builtin font can use it directly. 
(Remember to add pkfonts by package or so.)

Default resolution is set to 300dpi in fontdesc file. You can 
modify it according to your site, or override it by command line option:
dvi2ps -D RESOLUTION=(your resolution).

See /usr/local/lib/dvi2ps/doc/* files for customize.
