% File    : language.dat
% Purpose : specify which hypenation patterns to load 
%           while running iniTeX 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CAUTION: the first language will be the default if no style-file
%          (e.g. german.sty) is used.
% Since version 3.0 of TeX, hyphenation patterns for multiple languages are
% possible. Unless you know what you are doing, please let the american
% english patterns be the first ones. The babel system allows you to
% easily change the active language for your texts. For more information,
% have a look to the documentation in texmf/doc/generic/babel.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The hyphenation pattern files are in the dirctory:
%	texmf/tex/generic/hyphen
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The US-english patterns should be loaded *always* and as *first* ones.
% Define USenglish as an alias for american.
