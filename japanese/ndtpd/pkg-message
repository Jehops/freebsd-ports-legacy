You'll need manual configurations to actually activate `ndtpd'.

**** IF YOU WANT TO SETUP PRIVATE SYSLOG, edit /etc/syslog.conf.

1st) Copy a sample configuration file `ndtpd.conf.sample' to `ndtpd.conf'
     in `${PREFIX}/etc' directory, and edit it.
     Consult the "Configuration File" section of info file.

2nd) Copy a sample startup script `ndtpd.sh.sample' to `ndtpd.sh'
     in `${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d' directory, and edit it.

     a) To start `ndtpd' as a standalone daemon, set the variable
	`standalone' in the script to `YES', and exec it.

     b) Otherwise, to start as a child process of `inetd',
	set `standalone' to `NO', and edit the file `/etc/inetd.conf'.
	Consult the "Run as a Child of inetd" section of info file.
