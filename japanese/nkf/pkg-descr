Nkf is a yet another kanji code converter among networks, hosts and
terminals.  It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code such
as 7-bit JIS, shifted-JIS or EUC.

One of the most unique facicility of nkf is the guess of the input
kanji code.  It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, shifted-JIS and EUC.
So users needn't the input kanji code specification.
