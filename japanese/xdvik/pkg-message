=== IMPORTANT NOTICE ===

- xdvi(1) searches the necessary files from the share/texmf/xdvi/ptex
  directory first, and then the share/texmf/xdvi directory.

- The files in share/texmf/xdvi/ptex should not be edited
  directly.  Instead, copy them to share/texmf-config/xdvi/ptex and
  edit them.  xdvi(1) will find the latter files first.
