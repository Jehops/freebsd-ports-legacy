This is Wnn4.2, a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  It is
included primarily so that we can compile mule-2.1, a multilingual
emacs.

Since I don't have time to test anything else, only Japanese is built
at this time.  (Or I won't get it on the 2.0 CDROM!)  Also, jserver
doesn't seem to work well so it's temporarily disabled too.  Take a
look at the file patches/patch-aa and change them back if you want to
try others.

Note that binaries and libraries go to /usr/local, while man pages and 
includes go to /usr/X11R6.  That's the way it was designed, I don't
know why.
