Chimera is a program which allows a user to access World-Wide Web servers
and other information servers.  It presents the user with a point-and-click
graphical interface using the X Window System and the Athena Widgets.

This is version 1.65 with a kanji patch to display Japanese.  It
understands JIS/EUC by default: if you want to see Shift-JIS, add
"-xnllanguage ja_JP.SJIS" to the command line option.  Or you can use
the X resource "xnlLanguage".
