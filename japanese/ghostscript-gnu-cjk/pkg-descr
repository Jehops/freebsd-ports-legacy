GNU Postscript/PDF interpriter.
This port depends on print/ghostscript-gnu-cjk that is internationalized
version of ghostscript.  This port simply adds necessary configuration
as /usr/local/share/ghostscript/*/lib/CIDFnmap.jp

To install more fancy fonts edit the CIDFnmap.jp file.
To know how to edit, /usr/local/share/doc/ghostscript/*/CJK/README.jp
is helpful.

Internationalization information:
For those who are interested in reading also Chinese and Korean PS files,
one can simply add either or both of korean/ghostscript-gnu-cjk and 
chinese/ghostscript-gnu-cjk.   There is no conflict in adding and removing 
these ports.  Have fun!
