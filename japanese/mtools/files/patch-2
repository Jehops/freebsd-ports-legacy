+# A note on permissions:  a user must have read and write permissions for the
+# devices named here in order to access the DOS file systems.  You might give
+# ALL USERS access to ALL FLOPPY DISKS via the command
+#
+#     chmod a+rw /dev/*fd*
+#
+# or you might give SPECIFIC GROUP MEMBERS access to a PARTICULAR FLOPPY DISK
+# via the commands

+#     chmod g+rw /dev/rfd0 ; chgrp staff /dev/rfd0

+# (and ensure selected people are in a group such as staff).

+# Example: To prepare drive A: for use as a 1.44M floppy on FreeBSD:
+#   [1] low level format with ......... fdformat /dev/rfd0.1440
+#   [2] write a file system with ...... mkdosfs -f 1440 /dev/rfd0
+#   [3] then use mcopy/mdir etc. in the usual way.
