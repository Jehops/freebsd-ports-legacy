This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail
user agent and news reader).  It is compatible with Linux versions of plugins.
The Sun Java and Macromedia Flash plugins are available in this port, as are the
Japanese and U.S.  regional packs, personal security manager, spell-checker, and
talkback.  AOL Instant Messenger is omitted (see ports/net/aim).

For use with the Java plugin, linux_base-61 or linux_base-62 are
recommended (not linux_base-7).
