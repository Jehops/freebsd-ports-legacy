JVim 3.0 is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It can be
used to edit any ASCII and Japanese(SJIS/JIS/EUC/Unicode) text.  It is
especially useful for editing programs.

This package is built with Japanese support, using Wnn4.

There are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, command
line editing, filename completion, on line help, quoting, etc.. Read
difference.doc for a summary of the differences between vi and Vim.
