exmh is a TCL/TK based interface to the MH mail system.

IMPORTANT: exmh depends on the TK send facility for its background
processing.  With TK 3.3, send now uses xauthority mechanisms by default,
unless you compile TK with -DTK_NO_SECURITY.  Generally, this means that
you **MUST** must run xdm to start your Xserver.

FEATURES: As well as providing the usual layer on top of MH commands, exmh
has a number of other features.

JAPANESE ENVIRONMENT: To compose Japanese mail, you can use kinput2 with
<Ctrl-backslash> key.  Once kinput2 is used, the message header will have
"charset=iso-2022-jp".
