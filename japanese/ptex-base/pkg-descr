This is pTeX, TeX system with Japanese support.  This package installs
non-Japanese specific executables and all the non-executable files.

This system is based on teTeX 2.0.1 which contains TeX, LaTeX2e, and
various other TeX related programs.  

Note: Some of the features provided by teTeX may not work with
Japanese language, even though the TeX and LaTeX2e are able to handle
Japanese.  Use ptex and platex respectively.

Note: xdvi, dvips, and dvipdfm, which are part of teTeX package, are
not included in this package since they are not localized for
Japanese.  Use corresponding ports/packages in the japanese or print
category.
