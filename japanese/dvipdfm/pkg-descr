Dvipdfm is a DVI to PDF translator, developed by Mark A. Wicks.
It tends to produce nicer output than by using, say, dvips 
followed by ps2pdf.

This port is designed to be used with pTeX and cmpsfont, which it
will load as a dependency.

(japanese/dvipdfm is based on print/dvipdfm written by Stephen
Montgomery-Smith.)
