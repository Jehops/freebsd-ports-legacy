This has include files (e.g. wnn/commonhd.h) and a library file
(libwnn.a) to build Wnn6 clients. The files are included in

ftp://ftp.omronsoft.co.jp/pub/Wnn6/sdk/FreeBSD-2.2R.tar.gz.

It is treated as a free software, so this package is, too. But a
server of Wnn6, whose name is jserver, is not, and you must buy it
from Omron Software Co., Ltd.

Wnn6 is one of Japanese input methods. 'Wnn6 for Linux/FreeBSD' is
supported an only Japanese method. However, Wnn4.2 which is free is
supported Chinese and Korean ones, too.
