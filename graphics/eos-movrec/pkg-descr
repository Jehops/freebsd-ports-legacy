This program writes short movies with your Canon DSLR camera directly to the
computer.  The camera must have Live View feature to work; supported models
include Canon EOS 450D, Canon EOS 1000D, Canon 40D, Canon 50D, Canon 5D Mark
II, Canon 1Ds Mark III.  The program allows preview, Av, Tv, and WB control.

Video will be recorded using MJPEG codec, with no sound, roughly at 22 FPS
(depends on your camera).  Image size is also camera-dependent: 848x560 for
450D; 1024x680 for 40D, 50D, and top models; 768x512 for 1000D.  Resulting
file is simply a collection of Live View frames stored sequentially without
any compression in AVI container (expect file size to be quite large).
