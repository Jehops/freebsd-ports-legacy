The tools include programs to clip, rotate, scale, and position
GIF images.  It includes an X11 viewer, and code to dump GIFs to an
Epson-compatible printer in graphics mode, and several conversion utilities.

The library includes program-callable entry points for reading and writing
GIF files, an 8x8 utility font for embedding text in GIFs, and an error
handler.  GIF manipulation can be done at a relatively low level by
sequential I/O (which automatically does/undoes image compression) or at
a higher level by slurping an entire GIF into allocated core.

See /usr/local/share/doc/giflib directory for more information
on GIFLIB's capabilities.
