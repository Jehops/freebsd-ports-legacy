ShowImg is a feature-rich image viewer which can display numerous
formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF (animated) and MNG.

It consists of a tree view frame, a directory/preview frame, and a
view frame. The (larger) view frame can be exchanged with the (smaller)
directory/preview frame. It can preview and display images from
multiple directories and search for identical images.

ShowImg also features a full-screen mode, zooming, sorting, drag'n'drop
with Konqueror, and support for images in compressed archives (.zip).
