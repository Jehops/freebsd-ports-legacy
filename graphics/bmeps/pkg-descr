The bmeps package contains a command line program and a library to convert
bitmap image files (PNG/JPEG/NetPBM) to EPS or PDF and produces bounding box
files for use with LaTeX. 

The program produces EPS level 1, 2 and 3 and PDF level 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4.

Depending on the EPS level there are different compression and encoding
algorithms available: 

  _ ASCII-Hex encoding
  _ ASCII-85-encoding (requires PS level 2)
  _ DCT-pass-through of JPEG files (requires PS level 2)
  _ flate compression (requires PS level 3)

The program is intended to be used with LaTeX/dvips or other DTP software
accepting EPS graphics.

No automated scaling/rotating is done by the program to fit pages of any
paper size, this is left up to the DTP application including the graphics.
