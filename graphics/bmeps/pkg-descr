The bmeps package contains a command line program and a library to
convert bitmap image files (PNG/JPEG/NetPBM) to EPS. EPS level 1, 2
and 3 can be used.

Depending on the EPS level there are different compression and encoding
algorithms available: 

  _ run-length-compression (2 and above)
  _ flate compression (3 and above)
  _ ASCII-85-encoding instead of ASCII-Hex (2 and above)

The program is intended to be used with LaTeX/dvips or other DTP software
accepting EPS graphics.

No automated scaling/rotating is done by the program to fit pages of any
paper size, this is left up to the DTP application including the graphics.
