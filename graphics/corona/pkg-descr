Corona is an image input/output library that can read, write, and
manipulate image files in just a few lines of code. It can write
PNG and TGA files, and read PNG, JPEG, PCX, BMP, TGA, and GIF.
Corona was designed to be easy to use, and exports a straightforward
C++ API. With just a few lines of C++, you can add image loading
to your application.
