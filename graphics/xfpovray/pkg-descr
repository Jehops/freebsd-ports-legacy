xfpovray is a graphical interface to the cool ray tracing program POV-Ray
(http://www.povray.org).  It is written with the XForms library 
(http://bloch.phys.uwm.edu/xforms), and supports most of the numerous 
options of POV-Ray.   The interface was developed with POV-Ray version 3.0,
but things should work OK for earlier versions...  

Please read the documentation on POV-Ray before using xfpovray, 
especially if you will be using the animation loop or antialiasing.
