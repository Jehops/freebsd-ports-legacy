Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program, like CorelDraw or Adobe
Illustrator from the proprietary software world, and Sketch or Kontour from
the free software world. It is free software, distributed under the terms of
the Gnu General Public License, Version 2.

Sodipodi uses W3C SVG as its native file format. It is therefore a very useful
tool for web designers.

It has a relatively modern display engine, giving you finely antialiased
display, alpha transparencies, vector fonts and so on. Sodipodi is written in
C, using the Gtk+ toolkit and some Gnome libraries.
