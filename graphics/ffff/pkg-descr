FFFF is a fast mandelbrot fractal generator with features such as:

   * OpenGL
   * realtime zoom
   * SSE/AltiVec QuadPixel
   * SSE2/3DNow! DualPixel calc
   * FPU per pixel calc
   * GPU asm (Fragment/Vertex) calc
   * multiprocessor support
   * benchmarking
   * optimized assembler code!

This port uses the standard mandelbrot fractal at near-Xaos speed. Yet every
pixel is computed. There is also an interesting parameter ray algoritymn using
your 3D card. A 3D card is strongly recommended for screen speed and additional
coprocessing power.
