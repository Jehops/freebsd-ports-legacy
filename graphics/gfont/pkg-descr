The gFONT program creates a GIF image for a given ASCII string by the use
of an arbitrary TeX-available font (Postscript or METAFONT). The used font
is converted from TeX's PK format to gFONT's own GdF format (Gd Font) and
rendered into the resulting GIF image by the use of its own enhanced Gd
library. The result is intended to be included into HTML pages with an IMG
tag.
