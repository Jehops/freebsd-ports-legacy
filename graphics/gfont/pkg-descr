  gFONT -- Create GIF image rendered with TeX-available Font

  Version 1.0.2 (16-09-1997)

  The gFONT program creates a GIF image for a given ASCII string
  by the use of an arbitrary TeX-available font (Postscript or
  METAFONT). The used font is converted from TeX's PK format to
  gFONT's own GdF format (Gd Font) and rendered into the
  resulting GIF image by the use of its own enhanced Gd library.
  The result is intended to be included into HTML pages with an
  IMG tag.
