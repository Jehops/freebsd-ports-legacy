GridPix enables you to present large images over the Internet in an
efficient manner.  The image is stored in a tiled, layered format and
is presented to the user in pieces for quick zooming and scrolling.
Unlike other implementations that offer similar functionalities,
GridPix doesn't use plugins or applets -- it is pure HTML.
