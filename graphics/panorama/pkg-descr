Panorama is a framework for 3D graphics production.
This will include modeling, rendering, animating, 
post-processing, etc. Currently, there is no 
support for animation, but this will be added soon.

Functionally, is a structured API, composed of two 
dynamic libraries, and several plugins.  A simple 
console-mode front-end is included, which can load
scene descriptions and output a single image file.

A graphic front-end is under development and can
be found at the main web page.
