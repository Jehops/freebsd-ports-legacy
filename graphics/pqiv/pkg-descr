qiv (graphics/qiv) is a great image viewer, but it does not use gtk2
but imlib for image handling. This is bad, because many distributions
(well, at least gentoo) do not offer this library anymore as it's
quite old and not maintained anymore.

When the first release of pqiv was written, I used python, hence the
name. I expected somebody else to write a c-rewrite of qiv, so I
didn't really care about that. About one month later nothing had
happened yet, so I did this on my own. Starting from 0.4 pqiv means
"pretty quick image viewer", written in pure C, using gtk+-2.0.

Features include:
* Fullscreen
* Slideshow
* Rotate / Flip
* (Automatic/manual) Zoom
* Move by drag & drop in fullscreen
* Keep preferences in a configuration file
* Rather small executable (~36k), low ram consumtion, quick
* Execute predefined commands, pipe images through them or display their output
* Real transparency
* Fade between images
