Originally, PQIV was written as a drop-in replacement for QIV. The first
release was not more than a Python script, hence the name. Now, PQIV is
a (modulo some small extras) full featured clone of QIV written in C
using GTK-2 and GLIB-2.

Features include:
* Fullscreen
* Slideshow
* Rotate / Flip
* (Automatic/manual) Zoom
* Move by drag & drop in fullscreen
* Keep preferences in a configuration file
* Rather small executable (~36k), low ram consumtion, quick
* Execute predefined commands, pipe images through them or display
  their output
* Real transparency
* Fade between images
