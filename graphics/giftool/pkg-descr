PORT BUILD OPTION
=================

There are two useful options are suggested and available for this port of
giftool. You can specify it following "make clean".

make RETVALUE=yes
-----------
Giftool does not return value from main(), so it is impossible to use this
tools in programs like make(1) or pipes.
This option is suggested by Sergei Chechetkin <csl@whale.sunbay.crimea.ua>.

make MALLOCSIZE=yes
---------------
Giftool 1.0 or some earlier version cause segmentation fault about some
images. Something about pre-read seems to be bad, so make malloc size 
bigger to improve that.
This option is suggested by Hidetoshi Shimokawa <simokawa@sat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.

You can specify all options such as 'make RETVALUE=yes MALLOCSIZE=yes'.
