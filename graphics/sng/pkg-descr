The sng program translates between PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format
and SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) format. SNG is a printable and
editable minilanguage for describing PNG files. With sng, it is easy to
view and edit exotic PNG chunks not supported by graphics editors; also,
since SNG is easy to generate from scripts, sng may be useful at the end
of a pipeline that programmatically generates PNG images.
