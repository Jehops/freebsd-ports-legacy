Utah-GLX is a hardware OpenGL support for XFree86 X-Servers.

Currently supported hardware:
 o Matrox MGA-G200, MGA-G400
 o ATI RagePro (Mach64)
 o Intel i810
 o NVIDIA Riva series

Please note that some of the videocards above (e.g. i810) require kernel
support, which at the time of this writting (May 2000) is not implemented for
FreeBSD yet, so it may or may not work for your particular h/w.
