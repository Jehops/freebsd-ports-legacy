Additional Notes:
-----------------

If you built an SVGA server with 3d hardware acceleration for a nvidia card 
(RIVA 128, TNT, TNT2, TNT2 Ultra ..) please check that

- you changed the default colour depth to 16 or 15 in your /etc/XF86Config 
  file (keyword: DefaultColorDepth) plus 

and (this holds for Matrox G200/G400 too) check if

- you added to /etc/XF86Config (outside of any other section) the
  following 3 lines:

      Section "Module"
      Load "glx.so"
      EndSection

- you enabled System V shared memory support in your kernel


Things you might want to do:

. Try out ports/x11/xscreensaver (e.g. superquadrics) as an sample OpenGL 
  application,
. read the article or 
. have a look at the docs in X11/share/doc/riva-glx, esp the FAQ or
. visit http://www.freebsd.org/~3d
