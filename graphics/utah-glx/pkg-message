 NOTE: This software currently is "work in progress" and while it may work for
       your particular hardware (for example it is known to work quite reliably
       on Mach64), but it may have problems with some other supported h/w.
       Therefore we are encouraging all testers to report problems with this
       drivers to the official Utah-glx developers' mailing list.

       If you found any bugs or incompatibilities with some particular
       hardware configuration please fill the bug report and send it to the
       <utah-glx-dev@lists.sourceforge.net> address, which is the mailing list
       for Utah-glx.
