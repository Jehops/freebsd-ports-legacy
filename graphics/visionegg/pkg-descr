The Vision Egg is a very powerful, flexible, and free way to produce stimuli
for vision research experiments.
   - Perform experiments using an inexpensive PC and standard consumer
     graphics card
   - Perform experiments using a graphics workstation if special features
     needed
   - Data acquisition and other realtime hardware control capabilities such
     as fMRI
   - Dynamically generated stimuli can be changed in realtime via software
     or external hardware
   - Produce traditional stimuli to replace legacy systems
   - Produce stimuli not possible using other hardware
   - Demo programs to get you started right away
