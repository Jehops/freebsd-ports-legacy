Congratulations, XSane is now installed.

If you built it with WITH_GIMP set to yes, you can use
XSane as a GIMP plug-in. To do this, type:

ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/xsane ~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/xsane

Then run the GIMP, and a new "XSane" menu item should appear in the
"File->Acquire" menu.  Use this to access your scanner.

Have fun!
