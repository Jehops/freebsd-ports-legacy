Congratulations, XSane is now installed.

If you have GIMP installed, you can use XSane as a GIMP plug-in.
To do this, as root, type:

ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/xsane /usr/X11R6/libexec/gimp/1.1/plug-ins/xsane

Then run the GIMP, and a new "XSane" menu item should appear in the
"Xtns" menu.  Use this to access your scanner.

Have fun!
