Qtutils is a collection of command line programs for manipulating QuickTime
videos. It includes, among other things, qtconv, which allows one to change
the codec used by a QT file, qtsplit, which splits a QT file into several
smaller QT files, and qtsg, which creates a QT slideshow from a series of
images and a soundtrack. A script named vcdize also allows you to create
VCDs or SVCDs out of QuickTime sources.
