Frontline provides a gtk+/gnome based GUI frontend for
autotrace (http://autotrace.sourceforge.net) in 4 ways.

1. Stand alone program. A command `frontline' runs as a stand alone
   program. It will work well with Gnome desktop and nautilus.

2. Reusable library. A library `libfrontline.a' could be used as a
   building block of your application that needs the autotrace function.
   APIs are listed in frontline.h.  The stand alone program frontline
   itself uses libfrontline.a.
