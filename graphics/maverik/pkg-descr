MAVERIK is a publicly available virtual reality (VR) system, which has been
under development by the Advanced Interfaces Group since 1995. MAVERIKenables
rapid production of complex virtual environments as well as providing many
functions that are valuable to anyone developing applications with 3D graphics
or using 3D peripherals. MAVERIK deals primarily with graphical and spatial
management, and integrates with our other VR system, Deva, which extends
MAVERIK abilities to multi user and multi application virtual reality.

Within this wider context, MAVERIK is designed to support high-performance
rendering, including large-model processing, customised representations of
environments for different applications, and customisable techniques for
interaction and navigation. Although it is a component of a larger system,
MAVERIK works equally well stand-alone and forms an ideal platform for the
construction of VR applications for individual users.
