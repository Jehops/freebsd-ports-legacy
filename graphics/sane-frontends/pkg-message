Congratulations, SANE-FRONTENDS is now installed.

If you built it with GIMP packages/ports installed, you can
use xscanimage as a GIMP plug-in.  To do this, as root, type:

ln -sf %%PREFIX%%/bin/xscanimage %%X11BASE%%/libexec/gimp/1.1/plug-ins/xscanimage

Then run the GIMP, and a new "Acquire" menu item should appear in the
"Xtras" menu.  Use this to access your scanner.

Have fun!
