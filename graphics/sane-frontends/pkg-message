Congratulations, SANE-FRONTENDS is now installed.

If you built it with GIMP packages/ports installed, you can use
xscanimage as a GIMP plug-in.  To do this, type:

ln -sf /usr/local/bin/xscanimage ~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/xscanimage

Then run the GIMP, and a new "Acquire Image" menu item should appear in the
"Xtns" menu.  Use this to access your scanner.

Have fun!
