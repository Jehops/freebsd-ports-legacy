This is a collection of C++ libraries that provides a variety of
functionalities for geometries (bezier curves, splines, etc.).
Eigen3 is needed for most of the components to work since all of
the vector and matrix math is done using Eigen3. CPPTest is used
to perform unit testing on the components.
