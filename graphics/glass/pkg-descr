GLASS is a 3D library, designed to make easy use of structured
models in open GL applications. What do I mean by structured? That
is models, that are made up of components linked by basic transforms,
for example, rotations and translations. By using GLASS in an
application, these models can be loaded, modified, and displayed
using a minimum of function calls.
