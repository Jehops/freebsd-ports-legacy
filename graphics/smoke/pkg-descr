Smoke is a development version of a vector graphics engine capable of storing,
manipulating and rendering vector graphics.

A vector graphic image is represented by sets of lines and implicit curves.
These lines and curves are defined only by their coordinates on an imaginary
canvas. Thus a vector graphics image is resolution independent and can be
drawn into a pixmap of any size.
