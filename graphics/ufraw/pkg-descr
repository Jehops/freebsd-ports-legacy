UFRaw - Unidentified Flying Raw
Raw photo loader plugin for The GIMP
by udi Fuchs,

UFRaw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras.
It can be used by itself or as a Gimp plug-in.
It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility DCRaw.
And it supports basic color management using Little CMS, allowing
the user to apply color profiles.
 
Ufraw was originally based on the gimp plug-in by Dave Coffin
http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/
and on Pawel T. Jochym's (jochym at ifj edu pl) plug-in.
