MultiVideo is an image sequence viewer that is targeted to researchers in the
image processing field. It has the following features:
   * Display of several sequences simultaneously in multiple synchronized views.
   * Support of many sequence formats, including formats without compression
     that are very useful for researchers:
     o single file YUV 4:2:0 sequence
     o sequences made of several files (one file per image).
     o easy extension by C++ class derivation
   * Display very long image sequences without loading them in memory.
   * Gobal slider for random access in sequences.
   * Local sliders in each sequence frame for temporal adjustment with respect
     to other sequences.
   * Multithreaded design to allow for efficient image preloading.
   * On the fly zooming of images.
   * Repetitive display of the sequence in loop or ping-pong mode.
   * Choice of sequences to display on the command line or in a GUI file
     browser.
   * Adjustment of the display frame rate.
   * Saving an image of the sequence in PGM, PPM, PNG or JPEG format.
