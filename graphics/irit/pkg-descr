The IRIT solid modeling system is a simple environment that allows
one to model basic, primitive based, models using Boolean operations
as well as freeform surface's based models.

The system is designed for simplicity and is geared toward research.
As such, no graphical user interface (GUI) exists or is planned in
the near future. The modeling is performed using the main
module/executable of the system which is called (surprise!) IRIT.
A textual interface (or PUI for programmable user interface) is
available which provides the interaction interface. An interpreter
processes the user's command and executes them. This interpreter
includes general mechanisms that are common in high level programming
languages such as loops, conditional sentences, and functions. In
addition, features that can be found in modern languages such as
operator overloading and object oriented design are extensively
used.
