RenderPark is a system for physically based photo-realistic image synthesis.

It is providing a solid implementation of a wide variety of algorithms.
Features:
* reads models in MGF and new XRML (extended VRML'97) file format.
* images can be saved in PPM, TIFF and Radiance PIC format, for which numerous
  convertors exist.
* supports high dynamic range TIFF and PIC image output, suitable for lighting
  analysis purposes, e.g. using Radiance tools, or experimentation with tone
  mapping techniques ...
* illuminated models after radiosity can be saved in VRML'97 format.
* X-Windows/Motif based user interface.
* interactive navigation using graphics hardware (OpenGL) with various
  optimizations that make it suited for large models.
* wide range of tone mapping operators + calibrated monitor support.
* batch rendering with control through command line arguments or
  Inter Process Communication.
* rendering into an external canvas window makes RenderPark behave as a
  "plug-in" in other applications.
