This port installs the Linux version of the glide API, which is used
to program the 3dfx/voodoo cards. 

Only Linux binaries can use this library. If you have a compiled Linux
program that dynamically links against glide, everything is fine. If
you want to compile programs yourself, you have to compile them as
Linux binaries, using the compiler and tools from
ports/devel/linux_devel.

If your program uses other libraries, all libraries must be Linux
libraries as well. In the case of Mesa, you can use
ports/emulators/linux_mesa, which does everything for you. NOTE: The
Mesa shared library from the Linux quake distributions does not work,
use the FreeBSD port (although it installs a Linux lib).

A simple test program is installed under /compat/linux/usr/bin/test-glide
