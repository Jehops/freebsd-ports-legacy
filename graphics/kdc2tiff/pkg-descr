This software is made available for owners for Kodak's
DC120 digital camera who would like to convert the .kdc
files produced by the camera to .tiff or .jpeg files
using Linux or other UNIX machines. kdc2tiff and kdc2jpeg
pay particular attention to: aspect ratio accurate scaling
contrast adjustment gamma correction image rotation In
particular, the scaling algorithm takes into account the
Bayer pattern of the CCD (pixels have one colour only,
not three) and the exact (non-square) dimensions of the pixels.
