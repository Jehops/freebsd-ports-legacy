This is X11/Motif program based upon a popular DOS freeware program named
Fractint.  It is a true graphic user interface quite different from that
program.

The program will calculate, display and manipulate over 90 discrete fractal
types with very fast algorithms.  Other features include zooming, animation
(color cycling), color editing, spherical projection, and an amazing wealth
of parameters.  There are too many features to list here.

Also included are dozens of ancillary files such as color map files,
parameter files, formula files, and an extensive on-line help system.
