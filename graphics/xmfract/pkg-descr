        xmfract version 1.4 - a freeware fractal generation program.
          Copyright (C) 1995 Darryl House and the Stone Soup Group.

  This is xmfract 1.4, an X11R[5/6] Motif program based upon a
  popular DOS freeware program named Fractint. It is a true graphic
  user interface quite different from that program.

  The program will calculate, display and manipulate over 90 discrete
  fractal types with very fast algorithms. Other features include zooming,
  animation (color cycling), color editing, spherical projection, and an
  amazing wealth of parameters. There are too many features to list here.

  Also included are dozens of ancillary files such as color map files,
  parameter files, formula files, and an extensive on-line help system.
