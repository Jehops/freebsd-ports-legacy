OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character
recognition system.

Given the images it will automatically outline its contents, distinguish
between what's graphics and text and perform OCR over the latter. It
generates multiple formats being its main one ODT.

It features a complete GTK graphical user interface that allows the
users to correct any unrecognized characters, defined or correct
bounding boxes, set paragraph styles, clean the input images, import
PDFs, save and load the project, export everything to multiple formats,
etc. OCRFeeder was developed as the project of the Master's Thesis in
Computer Science of Joaquim Rocha.
