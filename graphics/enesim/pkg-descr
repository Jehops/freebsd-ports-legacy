Enesim basically it is a rendering library, that is, it allows you
to draw different graphics primitives (in Enesim it is called a Renderer)
into a target drawable (in Enesim a Surface). Given that a Renderer
can draw anything, it has its own state that is modified through
the renderer's specific properties setters and getters.
