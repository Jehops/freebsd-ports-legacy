From homepage of HGL:

The HGL gives the programmer access to the most interesting parts of
the Win32 and X11 library without exposing the programmer to the pain
and anguish usually associated with using these interfaces. The library
library is distributed as open source and is suitable for use in
teaching and in applications.
