The new correction of J desktop enviropment has come.

There aren't simple functions with photo retouch but with very
useful display functions which can display an animated gif, al-
pha channeled gif and alpha channeled xpm. And you can make a 
choice the language between English and Japanese because it's J.
So,I think this is the best partner of gimp.

Note that both graphics/jgv and japanese/jgv are mutually exclusive and 
SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED SIMULTANEOUSLY!
