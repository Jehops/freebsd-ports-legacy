This is the FreeBSD port of the HP-sponsored project to
develop Linux support for most Hewlett-Packard OfficeJet,
PSC, LaserJet, and PhotoSmart printer multi-function
peripherals (MFPs), which depending on the model can print,
scan, copy, fax, and/or access digital camera memory cards.
Only the parallel port and JetDirect (no USB!) are supported
under FreeBSD.

Includes a xsane plugin.
