Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages
your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a
zoomable lighttable.  It also enables you to develop raw images and enhance
them.

This project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
raw converters and image management tools (such as UFRaw or F-Spot).  The
user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
mipmaps, all stored in a database.  The user will always be able to interact,
even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.

All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
buffers for display.  The full image is only converted during export.  The
frontend is written in Gtk+/Cairo, the database uses SQLite3, raw image
loading is done using libraw, HDR, EXR, and low dynamic range are supported
through ImageMagick (MagickCore).  The core operates completely on floating
point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).
