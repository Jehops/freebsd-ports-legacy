The SVGFig package lets you draw mathematical figures in Scalable
Vector Graphics format (SVG), using the Python language.

As a tool, its usefulness lies somewhere between freehand drawing
programs, which don't give you quantitative control over your figures,
and traditional plotting packages, which fit your data into a prescribed
template. SVGFig allows you to draw anything you can express in Python.

SVGFig is particularly suited to handle non-linear geometries. All
lines, including the coordinate axis, curve if passed through a
non-linear coordinate transformation, and coordinate systems can be
nested in trees. This generalizes all the tools necessary for making
plots, so it is easy to create polar plots of radial data, Hammer-Aitoff
projections of the sky, translations in hyperbolic spaces, or experiment
with new representations.

SVGFig also maintains a convenient representation of SVG images as
Python constructs, so you can load graphics from SVG files, dissect
them, manipulate them with an automated script, and save them in batch.
