LuxRays is library dedicated to accelerate the ray intersection process by
using GPUs.

Uses a Data Parallel Model: it doesn't reduce the time spent to trace a single
ray but it is able to trace many thousands of rays in parallel.

Supports Hybrid CPU/GPU mode where only the ray intersection task is off load
to the GPUs while everything else run on the CPU and can be written with usual
tools and languages.
