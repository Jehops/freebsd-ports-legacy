With this Python module a program can create 3D objects (such as spheres,
curves, etc.) and position them in 3D space. Visual, running in a separate
thread, automatically updates a 3D scene many times per second, to reflect
the current positions of the objects.
The programmer does not need to deal with display management, but can focus
on the computational aspects of the program.
The user can navigate in the 3D scene by using the mouse to zoom and rotate
while the program is running. Visual supports full vector algebra.
