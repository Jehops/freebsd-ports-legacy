This is a HP SCSI scanner driver which uses the FreeBSD 'pt' (Processor
Type) driver.  It has been tested on the HP ScanJet 3C and 4A, and was
written for the HP ScanJet IIcx, so I suspect it will work with all newer
HP scanners without modifications.

To install the driver you must add a line to your kernel config file
like the following:
# HP Scanner
device pt0 at scbus?

Next, you'll want to make a link from /dev/pt0 to /dev/scanner for the
driver software.

# cd /dev
# ln -s pto0 scanner

At this point, you should be able to run the scanner program and see
results.
