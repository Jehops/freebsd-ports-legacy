wmGrabImage is a Window Maker DockApp that maintains a small thumbnail copy of
your favorite image from the WWW.  The image to monitor is specified via the
"-url <Image URL>" command-line option and it gets updated approximately every
5 minutes.  The update interval can be overridden via the "-delay <Time>"
command-line option (Time is in seconds).
 
Each of the three mouse buttons can be double clicked with the
following effects:

Left Mouse:
Brings up the full-sized image in xv.
 
Middle Mouse:
Sends a URL (specified via the -http <URL> command-line option) to an already
running netscape process or in a new netscape process if there arent any
running.
 
Right Mouse: 
Updates the image immediately.
