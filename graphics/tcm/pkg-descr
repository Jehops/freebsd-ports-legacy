The Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling is a collection of software tools to
present conceptual models of software systems in the form of diagrams, tables,
trees, and the like. A conceptual model of a system is a structure used to
represent the requirements or architecture of the system. TCM is meant to be
used for specifying and maintaining requirements for desired systems, in which
a number of techniques and heuristics for problem analysis, function
refinement, behavior specification, and architecture specification are used.

TCM takes the form of a suite of graphical editors that can be used in these
design tasks. These editors can be categorized into:

* Generic editors for generic diagrams, generic tables and generic trees.
* Structured Analysis (SA) editors for entity-relationship diagrams, data and
event flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, function refinement trees,
transaction-use tables and function-entity type tables.
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) editors for static structure diagrams,
use-case diagrams, activity diagrams, state charts, message sequence diagrams,
collaboration diagrams, component diagrams and deployment diagrams (only the
first three and last two UML editors are functional at this moment).
* Miscellaneous editors such as for JSD (process structure and network
diagrams), recursive process graphs and transaction decomposition tables.
