Geist is an object/vector based image manipulation package in its early
stage of development.

Basically, the idea of Geist is to be able to lay out images, shapes, etc,
whilst supporting full RGBA colorspace.  Layered, transparent objects a
speciality.

Geist can currently export to every file format supported by Imlib2, plus
it uses its own XML file format for saving documents between editing
sessions.
