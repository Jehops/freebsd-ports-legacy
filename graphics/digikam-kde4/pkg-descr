Digikam is a simple digital photo management application, which makes 
importing and organizing digital photos a "snap". The photos can be organized 
in albums which are automatically sorted chronologically. An easy to use 
interface is provided to connect to your camera and preview images and download
and/or delete them.

Digikam also uses the very flexible Kipi plugin architecture. Install the 
graphics/kipi-plugins and graphics/digikamimageplugins ports to extend 
Digikam's features.
