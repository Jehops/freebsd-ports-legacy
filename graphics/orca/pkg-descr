This is a port of Orca which is Blair Zajac's incredibly useful
tool for making web-viewable graphs of arbitrary data from text
files.

Uses a configuration file which describes which text files to read,
what the columns in the files mean, and how that information should
be graphed.

Often run as a daemon, automatically updating as files change.
Often run with the Orcallator.se script for Solaris machines and
corresponding configuration file (just because you collect the data
on a Solaris box doesn't mean you have to graph it on one too).

Written in Perl, uses RRDtool for data storage and graph generation.
