vid is a Image Capture program for USB cameras using the
Omnivision OV511 chipset.


These include the

  Creative Labs WebCam 3 (*** see note about the OV511+ below ***)
  D-Link DSB-C300 
  Puretek PT-6007 
  Alpha Vision Koala-Cam 
  Lifeview RoboCam 
  AverMedia InterCam Elite 
  MediaForte MV300 

The program was written by Peter Housel <housel@acm.org) and
is heavily based on the Linux OV511 driver from http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/

Notes On The OV511+
-------------------
There is a new version of the chipset called the OV511+.
This is slightly different to the OV511 and is not supported by this
program at this time.
Josh Elasser has reported that newer versions of the Creative Labs
WebCam3 use the OV511+ chipset and so cannot be used with this program.
