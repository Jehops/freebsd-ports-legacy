The ovtvid-bsd project has written for FreeBSD and NetBSD) a simple-minded
image capture program for USB webcams based on the OmniVision Technologies
OV511/OV511+ bridge chip attached to an OV7610 CCD imager.

This includes inexpensive webcams such as:
    * Creative Labs WebCam 3
    * D-Link DSB-C300
    * Puretek PT-6007
    * Alpha Vision Koala-Cam
    * Lifeview RoboCam
    * AverMedia InterCam Elite
    * MediaForte MV300
    * Trust Spacec@m 300

The program is heavily based on the OV511 Linux driver by Mark W. McClelland.
Recent versions of that driver support a wider array of cameras; if it supports
something that this program doesn't then contact us and we'll see what we can do.
