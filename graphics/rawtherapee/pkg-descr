    RawTherapee is a powerful RAW image processing appliction.
Main features:
 * Selectable high performance demosaicing algorithms
   (EAHD and HPHD and VNG-4).
 * Image post processing in 16 bit / channel mode
 * Exposure control in RGB space
 * Auto exposure with adjustable clipping point / Exposure compensation /
   Shadow and highight compression / Contrast adjustment, curve editor
 * White balance adjustment in RGB space
 * With in-camera, automatic and spot white balance options /
   Temperature/Green tint fine tuning
 * Highlight Recovery
 * Shadows/Highlights control in RGB space
 * Basic Luminance curve tool to modify the luminance channel
   in CIELab color space
 * Brightness / Contrast adjustment, curve editor
 * USM sharpening applied on the CIELab luminance channel
 * Classical USM parameters (Radius, Amount, Threshold) / Option to avoid
   noise amplification / Sharpening halo control
 * Optional RL Deconvolution based sharpening for even better sharpening results
 * Color shift control in CIELab color space
 * Allows color shift by shifting the CIELab "a" and "b" channels
 * Color booster applied on the CIELab "a" and "b" channels
 * Amplifies color channels "a" and "b" together or separately /
   Avoids color overamplification in high chrominance areas /
   Option to avoid clipping caused by too high color boosting
 * Luminance denoising algorithm applied on the CIELab luminance channel
 * Edge sensitive method to preserve as much details as possible
 * Color denoising tool applied on the CIELab "a" and "b" channels
 * Classical gaussian blur or edge sensitive bluring of the color channels
 * Fast switching between different postprocessing profiles
 * Image flipping horizontally or vertically, rotation by 90 degrees clockwise
   or counter clockwise
 * Arbitrary image rotation (straightening tool) with fill function or
   automatic crop
 * Simple lens distortion correction
 * Crop tool
 * Chromatic Aberration correction tool
 * Channel Mixer for Red, Green and Blue channels
 * C/A Correction
 * Vignetting Correction
 * ICC based color management
 * Change History with bookmarks to support before/after checking
