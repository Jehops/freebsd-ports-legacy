DISK SPACE WARNING:

Note that RawTherapee uses version-dependent cache and configuration
directories.  Please be advised that cache directories can grow large,
so be sure to check all users' $HOME/.cache/RawTherapee* and have them
remove older cache directories.

Also, after configurations have been moved to the new version's
directory, older $HOME/.config/RawTherapee* directories may be removed.
=======================================================================
Also, due to a bug that has not yet been found, RawTherapee will
cause an abort trap when shutting down. rawtherapee is now installed 
as rawtherapee.real, and rawtherapee is a wrapper script that will
prevent the creation of a core file in this situation, unless the
environment variable DEBUG is set and not empty.
