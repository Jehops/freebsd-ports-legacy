# If you have the Numeric extensions installed, make sure the

# they're commented out.
# 
# These modules provide a few more features than the two modules
# above, and significantly more speed in some circumstances

# NOTES:  
#  - The -lX11 for _opengl_num and openglutil_num is a hack around 
#    XFree86 4.0 libGL.so's undeclared dependence on libX11 (e.g. XFreePixmap).
