From the 'overview' section of the official site:

Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library
that is focused on Camera control. Producer's Camera provides projection 1,
field of view, viewpoint control, and frame control. Further, Producer can
be used in a multi-tasking environment to allow multiple Camera's to run in
parallel supporting hardware configurations with multiple display subsystems.
Threading, Camera synchronization and frame rate control are simplified in
the Producer programming interface. 

Producer provides a simple, yet powerfully scalable approach for real-time 3D
applications wishing to run within a single window to large, multidisplay
systems.
