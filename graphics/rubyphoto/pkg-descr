RubyPhoto is a program for creating image galleries for the web. It
recurses through a directory tree creating album index files for each
sub-directory and image index files and thumbnails of specified sizes
for each image. The generated HTML is completely customisable via
templates. All configuration and image/album information is supplied
in XML files.
