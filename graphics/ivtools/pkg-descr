This is a port of ivtools, a collection of vector-graphic drawing
editors which augments the original idraw from Stanford University
with mechanisms for scripting, networking, animation, and
graph-editing.  They also add support for additional raster formats
(PBM/PGM/PPM, PNG, GIF), arbitrary PostScript (using pstoedit), and
export/import via Unix filters.
