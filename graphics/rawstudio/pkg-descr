Rawstudio is an open-source program to read and manipulate
RAW images from most digital cameras. Rawstudio will convert
your RAW files into JPEG, PNG or TIF images which you can then
print or send to friends and clients. It has a graphical user
interface, so you can simply open a RAW file and experiment with
the controls to see how they effect the image.
