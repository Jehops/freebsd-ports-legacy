PLOTMTV's capabilities include 2D line and scatter plots (x-vs-y), 
contour plots, 3D surface, line and scatter plots as well as vector plots.
The program has an rough but functional Graphical User Interface, through
which it is possible to zoom in, zoom out, pan, toggle between 2D and 3D
plots, and rotate 3D plots. Both color and grayscale postscript output are
supported.
