KuickShow is a very fast image viewer that lets you easily browse large
galleries. A builtin filebrowser and manager is also available. It's somewhat
inspired by ACDSee. It supports many file formats, including JPEG, GIF, PNG,
PSD, BMP, TIFF, XPM, XBM, XCF, EIM, etc. It can zoom, mirror, rotate images,
adjust brightness, contrast, and gamma, and do a slideshow. It is fully
configurable through dialogs. It offers a filebrowser with basic filemanager
capabilities like renaming, deleting, creating directories, etc.
