Redact is an Edje compiler written in Ruby.

Unlike the official Edje compiler, edje_cc, Redact doesn't read EDC code - it
reads Ruby code instead. This means that Redact will allow you to write Edjes
in a full-blown programming language.

So why is this a good thing?

With edje_cc, the only way to automate the creation of parts and/or programs
is to use CPP macros, which are very limited feature-wise and hard to debug.
