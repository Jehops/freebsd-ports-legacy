The JUMP Unified Mapping Platform (JUMP) is a GUI-based application for
viewing and processing spatial data. It includes many functions common
to other popular GIS products for the analysis and manipulation of
geospatial data. The JUMP also provides a highly extensible framework
for the development and execution of custom spatial data processing
applications.
