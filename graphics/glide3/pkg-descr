This library is necessary in order to build XFree86's 3dfx DRI/DRM shim
(lib/modules/dri/tdfx_dri.so). It probably has other uses as well. :-)

The main distfile is unofficial. It was created by simply checking out
from CVS and tarring up the result on the date indicated in the filename.
This was done simply to make the port easier to deal with.

You will need to make sure to get the configure options right for the hardware
you will be using. This is left as an exercise to the reader. :-)
