Demeter is a cross-platform C++ library that renders 3D terrains using OpenGL.
Demeter is designed for fast performance and good visual quality and makes use
of advanced techniques such as dynamic tessellation (adaptive mesh) to render
vast landscapes in real-time, without the need for high-end hardware. It is
written as a stand-alone component that can be easily integrated into any kind
of application.
