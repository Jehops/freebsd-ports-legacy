This program is designed to convert scanned 12-lead
electrocardiograms into PNG format and a web-friendly
image size. It assumes that the electrocardiogram (ECG)
is printed with a black line on white paper with a red grid.

The problems this program is designed to solve are (1) an
ECG scanned at relatively high resolution (300 to 600 dots
per inch) imposes a substantial load on the web browser
because it contains about 6 million pixels which may require
18 to 24 MB of RAM to store for display. Also, (2) typical
scanners convert a clean paper ECG into a multitude of colors,
include green and blue. The resulting file cannot be compressed
efficiently because it does not contain as much redundancy, and
thus takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections.
