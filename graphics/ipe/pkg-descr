This is a port of Ipe, Otfried Cheong's Interactive Picture Editor.
Ipe has a very nice integration of LaTeX text and PostScript drawings.
There are a couple of gotchas that potential installers should be aware of

1) Unfortunately Ipe only works in 8 bit colour. As far as I know this is
a Motif limitation. Starting in higher colour depth will yield a core 
dump.

2) The previewing features sensitive to which versions of teTeX and ghostscript
are installed. They work with the versions listed in the Makefile, but 
I had problems with earlier versions.  Ipe is quite useable without the
preview features.
