This is a port of Ipe, Otfried Cheong's Interactive Picture Editor.
Ipe has a very nice integration of LaTeX text and PostScript drawings.
There are a couple of gotchas that potential installers should be aware of

1) Ipe needs a pseudocolor visual to work optimally.  XFree86
currently only provides this at 8 bit colour depth.  If you run Ipe at
a higher colour depth, it reverts to "monochrome mode", which is not
nearly as nice.  This falling back to monochrome mode is my
modification, so direct any complaints to me first.

2) The previewing features sensitive to which versions of teTeX and ghostscript
are installed. They work with the versions listed in the Makefile, but 
I had problems with earlier versions.  Ipe is quite useable without the
preview features.
