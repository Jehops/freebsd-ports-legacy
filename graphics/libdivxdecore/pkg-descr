Decore [excerpt from OpenDivX Project Mayo site]

"Decore" is our decoder core - that part of the codec that decodes
video from DivX video bitstream into uncompressed RGB bitmaps. Its
API is defined in decore.h. The API is another frame-in, frame-out
scheme, you give it a chunk of OpenDivX bitstream and it comes back
to you with an uncompressed RGB frame. Like "encore", "decore" is
truly independent of any other code, making no system calls.

"Decore" is a decoder compliant with MPEG-4 natural video, simple
profile. It also incorporates a video postprocessor which postprocessor,
which hides many of the artifacts inherent in low bit-rate video.
