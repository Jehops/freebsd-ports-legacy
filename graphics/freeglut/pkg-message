Since FreeBSD has new USB stack, freeglut normally doesn't build on FreeBSD 8
(yet). To workaround this I created small, ugly patch. this patch adds one
include file and comments out content of one function (only leaves return NULL).

I have no idea what kind of side effects this can cause. Joystick wont work.
There might be ports that won't compile, or apps that may crash because of
this. I don't know.

If you face any problems delete this port and install graphics/libglut.
