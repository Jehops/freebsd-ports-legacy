Tgif 3.0-p9

Tgif is an X-based interactive drawing tool that allows the user to draw
and manipulate objects; as of version 2.16, it is also a "hyper-structured-
graphics (or hyper-graphics) editor/browser on the World-Wide-Web".  Tgif
drawings can be converted to a variety of formats, including GIF,
encapsulated PostScript and XBM.  Tgif depends on the `netpbm' package,
available from the `ports' collection.
