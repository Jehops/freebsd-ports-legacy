X Visualization System is a visualization plug-in for XMMS inspired by
WinAmp's AVS. In xvs complex effects are built of many trivial ones put
together. Such an approach provides an extreme flexibility. Once designed
presets can be saved and later restored.

Features:

extreme customizability
fast, 32bit display (currently only in windowed mode)
semi-programmable blits & scopes
easy to use, powerful user interface
resizable window
save & restore
