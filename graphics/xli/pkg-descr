xli, xsetbg and xsetbg (the last two are symlinks to the first one)
display images on X11.

xlito works with xloadimage to "mark" images.  Take a look at the
xlito man page for details.  It also installs app-defaults for
xloadimage if it's not there but I didn't include it in the packing
list so it won't clobber an existing one if xloadimage is already
installed.
