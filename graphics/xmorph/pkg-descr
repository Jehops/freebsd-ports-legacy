Xmorph is a digital image warping program, also known as a "morphing"
program.

Xmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves,
creates, and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.
Xmorph has help pages built into it, so no external documentation
is necessary.

Gtkmorph is another graphical interface for the warping engine in
Xmorph.
