   NO WARRANTEES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

   Xmorph is a digital image warping program, also known as a "morphing"
   program.  It runs under the X Window System, using the X library, X
   toolkit, X miscellaneous utilities, and the Athena widgets, all of
   which are publically available from MIT, and part of the typical X
   installation.  It is written in ANSI C.

   Xmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves,
   creates, and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.
   Xmorph has help pages built into it, so no external documentation is
   necessary.
