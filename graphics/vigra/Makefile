# This port has been made as a building dependence for the hugin port.
# As far as I could test the hugin port runs without this port installed, so the package
# does not need to refer to this dependence.
# The hugin port is a gui interface to interact with panorama tools.

# Vigra's CMakeLists.txt does not support disabling those so we hook them
# as dependencies here unconditionally (without OPTIONS=) even though if
# they are not present then Vigra/CMake will do without them (they are not
# mandatory).
#
# Notice that if you define e.g. WITHOUT_VIGRA_TIFF and graphics/tiff is
# installed on your system, then the lib will be picked up by Vigra, the
# dependency will not be recorded by the ports system and later deletion
# of graphics/tiff will break Vigra. Only define WITHOUT_VIGRA_TIFF if you
# do not have graphics/tiff installed and do not want TIFF support in Vigra.
