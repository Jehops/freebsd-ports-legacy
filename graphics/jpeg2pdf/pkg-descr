jpeg2pdf has the following features:

* jpeg2pdf is fast. Unlike ImageMagick or other general image conversion
  tools, jpeg2pdf is specialized for its task an does this very efficiently.
* jpeg2pdf generates compact PDF files. Unlike general image conversion
  tools, jpeg2pdf doesn't do any processing/rescaling of the images, nor does
  it generate thumbnails of the pages in the PDF file.
* jpeg2pdf is a command-line program. So it can very easily be integrated in a
  shell script or a web server process to automate a conversion task.
