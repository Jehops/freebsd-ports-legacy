To use the drivers, make a copy of %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/drm.sh.sample under 
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/drm.sh.

To load the drivers run (as root):

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/drm.sh start

To unload it (currently made a no-op due to panics):

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/drm.sh stop

It'll also load the drivers automatically when the system is started.
Alternatively, you could add %%PREFIX%%/lib/drm to your kern.module_path sysctl
and let XFree86 load the drivers for you.

Once the modules are loaded, check http://people.freebsd.org/~anholt/dri/
for more information on how to set up the DRI.
