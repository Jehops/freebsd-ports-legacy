XMPS stands for X MPEG Player System. It's a simple Gtk program that will
(hopefully) play MPEG-1 files with sound under the *nix platforms. It has very
attractive skinnable user interface.
                                                                        
And what more?

XMPS is built on top of the SMPEG library from Loki entertainment. It has full
playlist support, can use OpenGL for the display if available, so that you can
play full-screen MPEGs without having to change screen resolution.
