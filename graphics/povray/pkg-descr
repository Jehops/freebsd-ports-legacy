POV-Ray 2.2 Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer

The  Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-Ray) is a copy-
righted freeware program that allows a user to easily cre-
ate  fantastic,  three dimensional, photo-realistic images
on just about any computer. POV-Ray reads  standard  ASCII
text  files that describe the shapes, colors, textures and
lighting in a scene and mathematically simulates the  rays
of  light  moving  through  the  scene to produce a photo-
realistic image!
