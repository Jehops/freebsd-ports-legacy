POV-Ray(tm) 3.0 Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer

The  Persistence  of  Vision(tm)   Ray-Tracer   creates   three-dimensional,
photo-realistic images using a rendering  technique  called  ray-tracing.  It
reads in a text  file  containing  information  describing  the  objects  and
lighting in a scene and generates an image of that scene from the view  point
of a camera also described in the  text  file.  Ray-tracing  is  not  a  fast
process by any means, but it produces very high quality images with realistic
reflections, shading, perspective and other effects.
