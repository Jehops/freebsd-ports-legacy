The VCD-Tools contain two programs, vcdmplex for multiplexing a MPEG audio
and video stream in a form suitable for the VCD and mkvcdfs for making a
raw image of the VCD. 

HOW TO MAKE A VCD:

   - create a MPEG-1 video stream with the dimensions 352x240 (NTSC) or
     352x288 (PAL) and a bitrate of 1152 KBit/sec
   - create a MPEG-1 layer 2 audiostream with a sample rate of 44100 Hz,
     stereo and a bitrate of 224 KBit/sec
   - multiplex these two streams with vcdmplex
   - use mkvcdfs to create a VCD image of one ore more of those MPEG streams
