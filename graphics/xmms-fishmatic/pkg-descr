Fishmatic is an OpenGL stereogram visualization plugin.  It generates
a backdrop, and the bubbles react to the music.  The fish swim in
three dimensions, with changing stereogram separation.

There are two types of fish: an angel fish, and a lamprologus.

This is not a static-dot stereogram.  The bubbles look like bubbles,
the fish are texture mapped with nice fish images.
