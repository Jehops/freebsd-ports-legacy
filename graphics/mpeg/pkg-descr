                 MPEG, CCITT H.261 (P*64), JPEG 
  Image and Image sequence compression/decompression C software engines.

The Portable Video Research Group at Stanford have developed
image/image sequence compression and decompression engines (codecs)
for MPEG, CCITT H.261, and JPEG. The primary goal of these codecs is
to provide the functionality - these codecs are not optimized for
speed, rather completeness, and some of the code is kludgey.

Development of MPEG, P64, and JPEG engines has not been the primary
goal of the Portable Video Research Group.  Our research has been
focused on software and hardware for portable wireless digital video
communication.  The charter of this group ended in the summer of 1994.
