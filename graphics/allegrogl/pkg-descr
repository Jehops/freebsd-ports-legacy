The library mostly provides functions to allow you to use OpenGL alongside
Allegro -- you use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen, and Allegro
for miscellaneous tasks like gathering input, doing timers, getting
cross-platform portability, loading data, playing samples and drawing your
textures. So this library fills the same hole that things like GLUT do.
