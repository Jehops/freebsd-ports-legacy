gd is  a graphics library.  It allows your  code to quickly  draw images
complete with  lines, arcs,  text, multiple colors,  cut and  paste from
other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or JPEG
file. This is particularly useful  in World Wide Web applications, where
PNG and JPEG are  two of the formats accepted for  inline images by most
browsers.

gd does  not provide  for every  possible desirable  graphics operation.
It  is not  necessary  or  desirable for  gd  to  become a  kitchen-sink
graphics package, but version 2.0 does include most frequently requested
features,  including  both  truecolor  and  palette  images,  resampling
(smooth resizing of truecolor images) and so forth.
