This is a small, display independent, and quick thumbnailing library.
The lib itself conforms to the standard put forth by freedesktop.org.
It seemed better to
break it out into a component that only depended on what was absolutely
necessary.  Upon showing raster the wonders of freedesktop.org
thumbnailing, he proclaimed that it was far to slow, this prompted him
to write epeg.  Epeg offers very noticeable speed increases to this
standard, but is only available if the input image is a jpeg file.  If
the file is anything other than jpg, the traditional freedesktop.org png
thumbnailing will occur.  To show the speed increase epeg offers,
Epsilon builds with and without epeg.
