==================================================================

saned will log to the 'daemon' facility; this is a hard-coded
default. Also, saned has no support for SSL/TLS or cryptographic
authentication; you may wish to deploy security/stunnel to wrap
it if you have concerns about security.

If you are using a USB scanner, you should edit /etc/devd.conf to
allow saned access permissions. Currently, devfs.rules(5) has no
support for USB specific filters such as vendor, product and
serial number.

Here is an example devd.conf(5) entry for an Epson CX3650
multi-function scanner/printer device (assuming you are sharing
the printer function with cups):

attach 100 {
        device-name "ugen[0-9].[0-9]";
        match "vendor" "0x04b8";
        match "product" "0x080e";
        action "usb_devaddr=`echo $device-name | sed 's#^ugen##'` && \
                chown cups:saned /dev/usb/${usb_devaddr}.* && \
                chmod 660 /dev/usb/${usb_devaddr}.*";
};

Note: A backtick must be used above, due to how devd(8) performs
variable substitutions.

To determine which port your scanner is connected to, inspect the
output of 'usbconfig list' before and after connecting your scanner,
and note the numbers which appear after 'ugen' in the first column.
Then, use 'usbconfig -d X.Y dump_device_desc' to learn the idVendor
and idProduct fields, and plug them into the above example entry.

Finally, restart devd with the command:
 # /etc/rc.d/devd restart

Please take %%PREFIX%%/etc/sane.d/dll.conf
as an example only; you may wish to enable only the 'net' backend
on client machines; be sure to point it at your scan server.

If you are setting up a scan server, you may also wish to edit
%%PREFIX%%/etc/sane.d/saned.conf
to only permit specific machines.
