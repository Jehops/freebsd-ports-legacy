To render the written raytracer files, POVRAY1.0 or newer should be
used. The included script files for automatic generation of readable
picture files out of the raytracer files need the "tgatoppm" command
out of the PBM+ distribution. A special text file called
README.raytracer explains how to use AERO's raytracing feature.
