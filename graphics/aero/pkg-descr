AERO is a simulation program based on rigid body systems. With the
built-in 3D editor you can create a virtual scene consisting of
spheres, boxes (cuboids), cylinders and plains. These objects may be
connected with links like spring, damper, rod and joint.

Now the simulation can be started and all objects obey to the laws of
physics. That means gravitation, air resistance, friction and all
additonal user defined forces are taken into account and set the scene
into motion. You can watch this sequence similar to watching a video
tape: play the scene or step back to memory positions and replay or
you can "wind" back to the beginning or forward to the end of the
scene.

In addition AERO is capable of creating scene files for the raytracing
program POV-Ray out of these sequences. This means you can create
fully rendered animation sequences, e.g. MPEG videos.
