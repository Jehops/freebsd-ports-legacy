A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access
to most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface
and X11 library without exposing the programmer to the pain and
anguish usually associated with using these interfaces.
The library also includes a module Graphics.SOE providing the
interface used in "The Haskell School of Expression", by Paul
Hudak, cf <http://www.haskell.org/soe/>.
