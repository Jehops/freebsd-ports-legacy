Sced is a program for creating 3d scenes, then exporting them to a wide
variety of rendering programs. Programs supported are:
 POVray, Rayshade, any VRML browser, anything that reads Pixar's RIB
 format, and Radiance. Plus a couple of local formats, for me.

Sced uses constraints to allow for the accurate placement of
objects, and provides a maintenance system for keeping this
constraints satisfied as the scene is modified.
