Juno-2 is a drawing editor that features a powerful constraint
solver, extensibility through an embedded programming and constraint
definition language, and double-view editing.

Constraints allow you to specify locations in your drawing
declaratively. For example, to draw an equilateral triangle, you
first draw an arbitrary triangle and then constrain its sides to
be equal; Juno-2 will adjust the vertices to make the triangle
equilateral. Moreover, the constraints are maintained whenever part of
the picture is changed, so constraints make it easier to maintain a
picture in the face of modifications.

Constraints in Juno-2 are declarative, and they can include non-linear
functions and ordered pairs. Moreover, the Juno-2 constraint solver is
not limited to acyclic constraint systems. This means that Juno-2's
constraint solver is significantly more powerful and easier to use
than other ``one-way'' constraint solvers such as DeltaBlue.

This port installs some examples into "${PREFIX}/share/examples/Juno".
Not all of them work; read the README file there.
