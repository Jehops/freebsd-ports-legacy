    This program aims to view many variously formated pictures
easily. So far, it can treat below formats:

  - archivers: bz2 exe dri gz libarc(*) misc pak tar
  - loaders: ald bmp grp jpeg lfg mag pic p2 png pms pnm xmb xpm
  - savers: jpeg pms png

    (*) libarc plug-in requires libarc library, so default is no.

    It has been implemented plug-in mechanism so that each user
can choose each format support linked in main program or separated
as plugin. Moreover, you can make your own plugins to extend
supported formats.
