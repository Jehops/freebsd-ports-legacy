Lphoto is a complete desktop solution for digital photo management that 
resembles iPhoto on Macintosh. It features convenient tools to import, re-touch,
manage, and share digital photos quickly and easily.

Lphoto supports every camera that is supported in gphoto2 (ie. all PTP cameras).
See http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/proj/libgphoto2/support.php for a list of
supported cameras.
