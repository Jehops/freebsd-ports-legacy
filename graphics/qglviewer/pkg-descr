QGLViewer addresses people programming in OpenGL to play around with three
dimensional scenes or to write software that uses OpenGL.

QGLViewer provides a set of classes for camera control, as well as comfortable
user interface that allows you to control your viewing parameters via mouse
and buttons. Additionally a framework for camera paths and their interpolation,
a light source editor and a simple scene tree are provided.

All of the QGLViewer helper classes (such as vectors, points, the camera,
etc.) are serializable using the Qt-builtin XML facility.
