This package contains a extensible scene graph library based
on VRML'97. It comes with a variety of import and export filters
to read/write a scene graph from/in a variety of 3D file format
and, of course, also a number of applications that make use
of it: a file format convertor and a VRML viewer. It is used
in RenderPark to read XRML input files.
