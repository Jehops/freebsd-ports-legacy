Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  These are
also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's
PDF software.

It can also convert PDF input to ps, text, and info formats; and
split out fonts and images.

This port, when built with 'make WITH_DRAW=yes', has support for drawing,
saving and deleting annotations from PDF files.
