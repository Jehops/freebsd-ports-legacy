An image gallery generator for KDE

Features:
* load a set of images (from different directories)
* convert them to another format, resize them and insert copyright text on 
them
* create thumbnails for them
* add descriptions for the images
* create a gallery html file, which contains the thumbnails
* this gallery format can have different look and feel (by using templates)
* insert navigation buttons, text descriptions near the fullsize images
* save the project, so you can use later to regenerate the same or slightly
  different (eg. descriptions in other languages) image gallery
