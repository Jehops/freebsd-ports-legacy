Vertex 3D Model Assembler (sometimes reffered to as just Vertex) is a unique
modeller designed specifically for generating efficient game models for (but
not limited to) games and applications using OpenGL's style of graphics
rendering.

This is not a modeller intended to create massive 3D scenes for ray tracers.
However there are plans to support exporting models to ray tracers (ie POVRAY),
Vertex is not intended to be an eye candy modeller but rather a strict high
performance game model maker.

Vertex supports the native V3D format, it is a hybrid text file format designed
to easilly support third party proprietery data as well as V3D model data in an
OpenGL friendly layout so that it can be read and loaded quickly into OpenGL
display lists (if that is what the application wants) or into editable data
structures in terms of `models' and `primitives'. One V3D file may contain
multiple modelmodels and embedded third party proprietery data within and
outside model sections in the file.

Vertex is a modeller written by game programmers for game programmers, its
intent is to maximize efficiency and detail tradeoff for high performance
animations in games. Artists using modellers for ray-tracers make need some
breaking into the differences of making models for ray tracers vs games.
