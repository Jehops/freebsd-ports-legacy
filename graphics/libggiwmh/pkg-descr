libggiwmh is a libggi extension whereby wmh stands for 'Window Manager Hints'
It adds features like moving, resizing, iconifying, z-ordering Windows and more
that happen to contain a ggi visual.
It is safe to use it even on non-windowed targets. The ggiWmh* functions just
fail in that case, where the failure indicates a NOOP.
