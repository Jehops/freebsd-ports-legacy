HOpenGL is a Haskell binding for OpenGL (GL 1.2.1 / GLU 1.3) and GLUT
for the lazy functional language Haskell. It uses a foreign language
interface and complex instance heads, language extensions which are
not yet fully standardized. Because of this, HOpenGL works only with
recent versions of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and Hugs. With
a little work it can probably tweaked to work with NHC98, but this has
not been tested yet. Following the discussions in the relevant mailing
lists, the above extensions are likely to be included into the next
version of the Haskell language, so HOpenGL is simply a little bit
ahead of time...  ;-)                                (From the README)
