Please, check the FreeBSD Handbook for instructions
on building a custom kernel. If you do not know
where to find it, check the FreeBSD website

Also, if the port finished building but
did not install the aviplay program. You
should consider installing the very
latest qt library supporting threads.
Version 2.2.3 and over should be
enough. Then, try rebuilding the avifile
port.

updating your port tree if you need to.
