The Python Computer Graphics Kit is a collection of modules that contain the
basic types and functions to be able to create 3D computer graphics images.
The most important things to mention are the new types, such as vectors,
matrices and quaternions and the RenderMan binding to create the input for a
RenderMan compliant renderer. The kit itself does not contain any
functionality to produce images directly.

Even though the kit focuses on RenderMan, some of the modules contain general
types/functions that can be used by any rendering method. For example, the
vectors and matrices or the noise module don't depend on RenderMan at all and
can also be used inside an OpenGL program or to produce input for other
renderers, such as POV-Ray or Virtualight.
