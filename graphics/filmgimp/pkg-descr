Film Gimp is a motion picture editing tool primarily used for
painting and retouching of movies. With sixteen bits per component
instead of eight, Film Gimp has much more color depth capacity than
Gimp. Film Gimp extended Gimp to operate upon a series of images
and in 16-bit linear and floating point color depths. Film Gimp is
currently based upon the HOLLYWOOD 1.0.4 branch of Gimp.
