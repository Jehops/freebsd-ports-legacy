fig2pstricks is a command-line driven application to convert a fig (or xfig)
version 3.2 file to PSTricks codes. It is especially useful to convert
graphics created by R's xfig() device, but it can be used with any fig files.
When used together with LaTeX, dvips, ps2pdf, and Prosper, it can also create
a PDF slide show with great ease.
