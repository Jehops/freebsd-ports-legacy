# Several problems at once here:
# - The port does not include graphviz's include directory, assuming it is
#   always in the compiler's default path (ie. /usr/include).
# - The port includes <graphviz/foo.h>, while code is expected to include
#   <foo.h> instead, and pass -I${LOCALBASE}/graphviz instead of just
#   -I${LOCALBASE} to the compiler.
# - The code in the development repository does a better job at fixing the
#   problems above, but it still relies on the deprecated libgraph library that
#   graphics/graphviz in ports does not install anymore.
