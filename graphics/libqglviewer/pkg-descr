libQGLViewer is a GPL-free software C++ library which lets you quickly start
the development of a new 3D application. It is designed for 3D developers, who
can display and move around a 3D scene by simply providing the openGL orders
that define their 3D geometry. The viewer is designed to be as general as
possible and is not designed for a specific 3D application. It provides some
useful classical functionalities such as a camera trackball, screenshot saving,
mouse manipulated frames, stereo display, keyFrames and more. It hence has a
strong pedagogical interest and is well suited for openGL assignements.

libQGLViewer is not a 3D viewer that can be used directly to view 3D scenes in
various formats (well, there is a 3dsViewer example, but it is just a proof of
concept). It is more likely to be the starting point for the coding of such a
viewer.
