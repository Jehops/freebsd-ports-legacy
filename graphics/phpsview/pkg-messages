When you have a problem with phpsview, please read following Q and A.

Q. The capture program doesn't work with the message "Not found Philips Webcam",
   or "Permission denied".

A. 1) Check your dmesg and make sure the camera was attached as ugen device.
      If your camera was attached as uaudio device, apply a patch that tells
      to the kernel that these cameras are not audio devices (although it has
      a microphone in it).
      http://www.medias.ne.jp/~takam/bsd/phpsview-netbsd-sys-1.6.2.diff

      If your camera doesn't match with the entry in above patch, you have to
      add your camera in the same manner, or disable uaudio driver.

   2) Make sure you can write to the device file connected to your camera.
      With default settings, regular user can't write to /dev/ugen*.
      Run chmod a+w /dev/ugen0 (or other corresponding device file)
      or setup /etc/devfs.rules to makes the device file will be created 
      with a suitable permission every time you plug your camera to the
      devfs running system (such as 5.x or higher).

Q. phpsview seems to be working with no errors, but I can't get the right image.

A. Some people said that FreeBSD ohci USB driver had something troubles.
   If you have problems with ohci system, please upgrade FreeBSD to 5.4
   and try again (I hear that FreeBSD 5.4-RC is free from the problem).
