Ayam is a free 3D modeling environment for the RenderMan Interface
(formerly known as "The Mops"). Ayam is primarily aimed at the
platforms BMRT (Blue Moon Rendering Tools, a RenderMan compliant
renderer by Larry Gritz (Exluna) runs on. As BMRT are available
in FreeBSD only as Linux binaries, Ayam will be compiled with code
from the Affine Toolkit with limited functionality.
No parsing of slc compiled shaders will be possible.
