Muggy.app is the simple text editor for the X.
It is able to run under the Macintosh [and|or] Windows9?,too.
But it's not supported.

	Muggy has two modes called "View" and "Edit".
	So you don't have to choose editor or viewer.
	I think it's unique.

	She will be editable if you run her with no parameters.
	And if you run her with a name of file,she will run in the
	"View" mode.
	
	You can change the modes if you want.

Note that both editors/muggy and japanese/muggy are mutually exclusive and 
SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED SIMULTANEOUSLY!
