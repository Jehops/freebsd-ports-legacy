You will very shortly have finished  a network install of StarOffice 5.2.
Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as the user that you usually use.
Then run "make install-user" and do a standard workstation install.
Change the install path to $HOME/office52. Then add $HOME/office52/ to your path.

It will now be ready to use.

Good Luck
