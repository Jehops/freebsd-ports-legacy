This is a version of sed based on GNU sed 3.02.80.  It is not
a version of GNU sed, though.

Relative to 3.02, there are several new features (including in-place
editing of files, extended regular expression syntax and a few new
commands) and some bug fixes; see the NEWS file for a brief summary
and the ChangeLog for more detailed descriptions of changes.

The biggest note, i think is the *huge* speed difference, where
regular sed might take a few mins, super-sed can take only seconds
this is not true in all cases, and sometimes you have modify your
regexp syntax, however for the speed increase, it might be worth
it.
