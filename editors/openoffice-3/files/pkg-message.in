OpenOffice.org %%OOOTAG%% will soon been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1. User installation
--------------------

Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed OO.org dir
in your homedir, the setup installs ".%%OOODIR%%" folder.

2. Starting OO.org
------------------

There are some wrappers installed for faster startup.
Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sbase
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-setofficelang
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-smath
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-spadmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OO.org does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.

3. If you run into problems
--------------------------------------------------
If you somehow run into problems, please remove the already
installed ".%%OOODIR%%" dir in your homedir. Redo the user
installation and the problems should go away.
