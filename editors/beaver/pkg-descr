Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR, for Linux and other Unix (and even
Windows); in other words, it's a text editor that is intended to be
lightweight, but full of useful features for programming, from
websites editing to C coding. It is based upon the GTK+ toolkit,
supports many languages through config files and offers functions such
as automatic indentation, completion and correction, or syntax
highlighting. In fact, it is 100% compatible with the Ultraedit's
wordfile.txt files, and has its own mini macro language.
