Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl which aims to bring the
concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text file with
wiki markup.

Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved automatically. Creating
a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing page.

Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look and feel
of an outliner.
