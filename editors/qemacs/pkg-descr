QEmacs has features other big editors lack:
* Full screen editor with an Emacs look and feel with all Emacs common features:
multi-buffer, multi-window, command mode, universal argument, keyboard macros, 
config file with C like syntax, minibuffer with completion and history. 
* Can edit files of hundreds of Megabytes without being slow by using a highly 
optimized internal representation and by mmaping the file. 
* Full Unicode support, including multi charset handling (8859-x, UTF8, SJIS, 
EUC-JP, ...) and bidirectional editing respecting the Unicode bidi algorithm. 
Arabic and Indic scripts handling (in progress). 
* WYSIWYG HTML/XML/CSS2 mode graphical editing. Also supports lynx like 
rendering on VT100 terminals. 
* WYSIWYG DocBook mode based on XML/CSS2 renderer. 
* C mode: coloring with immediate update. Emacs like auto-indent. 
* Shell mode: colorized VT100 emulation so that your shell work exactly as you 
expect. Compile mode with next/prev error. 
* Input methods for most languages, including Chinese (input methods come from 
the Yudit editor). 
* Hexadecimal editing mode with insertion and block commands. Unicode hexa 
editing is also supported. 
* Works on any VT100 terminals without termcap. UTF8 VT100 support included 
with double width glyphs. 
* Small! Full version (including HTML/XML/CSS2/DocBook rendering and all 
charsets): 200KB big. Basic version (without bidir/unicode 
scripts/input/X11/C/Shell/HTML/dired): 49KB.
