QEmacs has features other big editors lack:
* Full screen editor with an Emacs look and feel with all Emacs common
  features: multi-buffer, multi-window, command mode, universal argument,
  keyboard macros, config file with C like syntax, minibuffer with
  completion and history.
* Can edit files of hundreds of Megabytes without being slow by using a
  highly optimized internal representation and by mmaping the file.
* Full UTF8 support, including bidirectional editing respecting the Unicode
  bidi algorithm. Arabic and Indic scripts handling (in progress).
* C mode: coloring with immediate update. Emacs like auto-indent.
* Shell mode: colorized VT100 emulation so that your shell work exactly as
  you expect. Compile mode with next/prev error.
* Input methods for most languages, including Chinese (input methods come
  from the Yudit editor).
* Hexadecimal editing mode with insertion and block commands. Unicode hexa
  editing of UTF8 files also supported.
* Works on any VT100 terminals without termcap. UTF8 VT100 support included
  with double width glyphs.
* X11 support. Support multiple proportionnal fonts at the same time (as
  XEmacs). X Input methods supported. Xft extension supported for anti
  aliased font display.
