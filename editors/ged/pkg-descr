GNU ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display,
modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via
shell scripts.

A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in the current
directory and cannot execute shell commands.

Ed is the "standard" text editor in the sense that it is the original
editor for Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however,
it is superseded by full-screen editors such as Vi or Emacs.
