AbiWord extras (Templates, clipart, dictionary files, etc)

This directory tree contains GPL or GPL-compatible files used by AbiSuite
that are very big and/or that don't change very often.  The files in this
directory may or may not be used in the actual compilation, but probably
are used in the installation or at runtime.  These files were kept out of
the abi/user directory to decrease download times for those pulling down
periodic tarballs.
