This is a package containing only the executables for mule-2.3, a
multilingual editor based on emacs-19.34.

You should install a package, mule-common-2.3, containing emacs lisp
files, info pages, and so on (except executables) for mule-2.3.

This package is not built with any particular language support.  If
you want a built-in input method, look into the mule ports in
language- specific directories.

This package and the package, mule-common-2.3 are designed *not* to
clobber any existing emacs installation.  In particular, the
executables and man pages of etags/ctags are not installed, and the
info pages that come with the original emacs don't get installed too.
The Japanese version is build to install everything, by the way.

A "dir" file is supplied in the
${PORTSDIR}/editors/mule-common/files/ subdirectory of the
ports package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info to read mule info
pages, but also make sure you also add everything that may have been
added to that file!
