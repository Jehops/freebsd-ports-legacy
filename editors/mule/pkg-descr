This is mule-2.2.2, a multilingual editor based on emacs-19.28.

This package is built with Japanese support, using Wnn, as default.  I 
don't use other language/input methods.  People are welcome to test
other configurations and report their results.

This package is designed *not* to clobber any existing emacs
installation.  In particular, the executables and man pages of
etags/ctags are not installed, and the info pages that come with the
original emacs don't get installed too.  Remove the file
patches/patch-ab if you want this package to stand on its own.

A "dir" file is supplied in the files/ subdirectory of the ports
package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info to read mule info pages,
but also make sure you also add everything that may have been added to
that file!
