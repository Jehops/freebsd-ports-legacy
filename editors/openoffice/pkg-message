OpenOffice.org Build 641 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Matthias Rauch <mrauch@netbsd.org>

OpenOffice.org will soon been installed in
${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org1.0/

Once this is done run "make install-user" as the user you like to
use OpenOffice.org and choose a standard workstation installation.
Thereafter, OpenOffice.org can be started with
${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/soffice.

If OpenOffice.org asks you to choose the Java JDK during
"make install-user", you must choose the linux jdk1.3.1.
Native FreeBSD jdk1.3.1 does not work yet with FreeBSD
openoffice and OO does ignore it.
