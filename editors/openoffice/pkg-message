OpenOffice.org Build 1.0.1 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>

OpenOffice.org will soon been installed in
${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org1.0/

1 User installation
-------------------

1.1 OO.org installed from the ports collection

Once this is done you have to run "make install-user" as the
user you like to use OO.org and choose a standard workstation
installation.

1.2 OO.org installed as package

If you have just installed OO.org as package, there is no
"make install-user" option available. Instead you'll have
to run as the user you like to use OO.org:

"${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-setup" and choose a standard workstation
installation.

2 JDK-Installation
------------------

If OO.org asks you to choose the Java JDK during
"make install-user", you must choose the linux jdk1.3.1.
Native FreeBSD jdk1.3.1 does not work yet with FreeBSD
OO.org does ignore it.

3 Start OO.org
--------------

There are some wrappers installed for fast startup.
Add "${PREFIX}/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sagenda
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-scalc
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sdraw
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-setup
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sfax
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-simpress
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-spadmin
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sweb
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-swriter

4 Setup problems
----------------

If the setup complains about a missing file
"setup.ins", it's time to upgrade your FreeBSD system
to the lastest version. You will encounter this bug
only if your OS is older than FreeBSD 4.6 STABLE.
4.6 RELEASE is still affected.
