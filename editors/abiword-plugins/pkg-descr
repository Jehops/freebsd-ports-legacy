AbiWord Plugins extend AbiWord in various ways. Note that some of these
plugins are not available on all platforms that AbiWord supports.

The plugins are often packaged as bundles for your convenience. One bundle is
comprised of import and export plugins, which read and write various file and
component formats, and the other bundle is comprised of tools and utilities
that perform various helpful tasks from within AbiWord.
