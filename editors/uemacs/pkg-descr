	MicroEMACS is a tool for creating and changing documents,
programs, and other text files. It is both relatively easy for the
novice to use, but also very powerful in the hands of an expert.
MicroEMACS can be extensively customized for the needs of the individual
user.

	MicroEMACS allows several files to be edited at the same time.
The screen can be split into different windows and screens, and text may
be moved freely from one window on any screen to the next. Depending on
the type of file being edited, MicroEMACS can change how it behaves to
make editing simple. Editing standard text files, program files and
word processing documents are all possible at the same time.

	There are extensive capabilities to make word processing and
editing easier. These include commands for string searching and
replacing, paragraph reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping,
word move and deletes, easy case controlling, and automatic word counts.

	For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing macroes can be
written. These macroes allow the user a great degree of flexibility in
determining how MicroEMACS behaves. Also, any and all the commands can
be used by any keystroke by changing, or rebinding, what commands
various keys invoke.

	Special features are also available to perform a diverse set of
operations such as file encryption, automatic backup file generation,
entabbing and detabbing lines, executing operating system commands and
filtering of text through other programs (like SORT to allow sorting
text).
