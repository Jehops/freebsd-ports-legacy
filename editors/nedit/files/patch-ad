! If no server is running, \fBnc\fR will start one unless configured otherwize.
  Client/server mode is useful for integrating NEdit with software development
  environments, mailers, and other programs; or just as a quick way to open files
  from the shell command line without starting a new NEdit session.

! Communication between \fBnc\fR and \fBnedit\fR(1) is through the X display. So as

! machines sharing a common file system, \fBnc\fR will not be able to find a server
  that is running on a machine with a different host name, even though it may be
  perfectly appropriate for editing a given file.
