WEMI, Library of MIME feature for GNU Emacs for xemacs.

  WEMI is a branch of SEMI kernel package using widget.  It is a
  library to provide MIME feature for GNU Emacs based on SEMI API.
  Namely it contains whole features of SEMI thus it is a replacement
  of SEMI.

  MIME is a proposed internet standard for including content and
  headers other than (ASCII) plain text in messages.

	RFC 2045 : Internet Message Bodies
	RFC 2046 : Media Types
	RFC 2047 : Message Header Extensions
	RFC 2048 : MIME Registration Procedures
	RFC 2049 : MIME Conformance

  WEMI has the following features:
	- MIME message viewer   (mime-view-mode) (RFC 2045 .. 2049)
	- MIME message composer (mime-edit-mode) (RFC 2045 .. 2049)

  MIME message viewer and composer also support following features:
	- filename handling by Content-Disposition field (RFC 1806)
	- PGP/MIME security Multiparts (RFC 2015)
	- application/pgp (draft-kazu-pgp-mime-00.txt; obsolete)
	- text/richtext (RFC 1521; obsolete; preview only)
	- text/enriched (RFC 1896)
	- External method configuration by mailcap (RFC 1524)

  Notice that this package does not contain MIME extender for any
  MUAs.  They are released as separated packages.

  WEMI is installed the following directory tree:
	${LOCALBASE}/lib/xemacs/site-lisp/semi/	--- WEMI

*** Caution!! ***

  Because WEMI is completely compatible with SEMI, WEMI overrides
  SEMI.
