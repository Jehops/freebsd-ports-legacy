SoftMaker Office 2006 comes with the following applications:
TextMaker 2006, the reliable and friendly word processor that reads and writes
all Microsoft Word files without a hitch.

each other. For instance, you can insert PlanMaker worksheets into TextMaker.
Furthermore, both TextMaker and PlanMaker support the dBASE database format so
they can access the same database files.
Compatible with Microsoft Office, OpenDocument, and more, pdf exports.

TextMaker and PlanMaker read and write these file formats with highest fidelity.
You can even set your default file types in TextMaker and PlanMaker to "Word"
and "Excel" and never worry about exchanging documents again!
