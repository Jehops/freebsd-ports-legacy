OpenOffice Build 641 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Matthias Rauch <mrauch@netbsd.org>

OpenOffice has now been installed in ${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org1.0/

Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as the user
that you usually use. Then run "make install-user" and do
a standard workstation Thereafter, OpenOffice can be started using the
${PREFIX}/bin/soffice command.

If OO asks you to choose the Java JDK during user-installation, you
must choose the linux jdk1.3.1. Native FreeBSD jdk1.3.1 does
not work yet with FreeBSD openoffice and OO does ignore it.
