display editor (emacs binary only).

This package's emacs has a dynamic loading module function.

NOTE: This binary is not linked with libxpg4 shared library by default.
If your LANG environment variable has a value but "C", the following
warning message may be displayed:

	Warning: locale not supported by C library, locale unchanged

If you complain about this message, type `make install WITH_XPG4=yes'
