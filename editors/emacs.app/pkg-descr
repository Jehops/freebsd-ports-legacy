This is GNU Emacs ported to OS X and GNUstep, based on the earlier
Rhapsody, OPENSTEP, and NeXTSTEP versions.
This port offers superior platform support for MacOS X and GNUstep,
including full desktop integration (dock, drag/drop, etc.), standard
keybindings, use of standard Font, Color, and File open/save panels,
and support for Services. Via GNUstep, it provides anti-aliased font
rendering on Linux and other Unix systems.
This port is based on GNU Emacs 23 from CVS.
