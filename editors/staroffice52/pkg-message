You will very shortly have finished a network install of StarOffice
5.2.  Next, each user must run "make install-user" in this directory
and do a standard workstation install.  Change the install path to
$HOME/office52. Then add $HOME/office52/ to your path.

It will now be ready to use.

Good Luck
