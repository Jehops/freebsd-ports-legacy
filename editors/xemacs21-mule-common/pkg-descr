This is XEmacs lisp files, info pages, and so on (except executables)
for XEmacs 20.4, the next generation of Emacs.

You must install one of packages, xemacs, jp-xemacs-*-20.4 (
jp-xemacs-canna-20.4, jp-xemacs-canna+sj3-20.4, etc.), each of which
contains only the executables for xemacs-20.4.

This package and the above package of the executables *will* clobber any
existing XEmacs installation.  In particular, the executables and man
pages of etags/ctags are installed, and the info pages that come with
the original emacs get installed too.

Although this shouldn't cause any problems to run both mule and emacs,
it may cause some confusion when one of them is pkg_delete'd.  If
someone has a solution to this, please tell me.

A "dir" file is supplied in the ${PORTSDIR}/editors/xemacs-common/files/
subdirectory of the ports package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info
to read mule info pages, but also make sure you also add everything
that may have been added to that file!
