StarOffice 6.0 Personal Install How-To

Written by:   Martin Blapp <mb@imp.ch>

------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:

If a user installation fails, just restart it. It will
work the second time. Remove then your $HOME/staroffice6.0
directory and the line beginning with "StarOffice 6.0" in
your $HOME/.sversionrc and restart the installation.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You will very shortly have finished  a network install of
StarOffice 6.0. Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as
the user that you usually use. Then run "make install-user" and
do a standard workstation install. Change the install path to
$HOME/staroffice6.0. Then add $HOME/staroffice6.0/ to your path.

It will now be ready to use.

Good Luck
