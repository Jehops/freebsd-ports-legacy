OpenOffice.org Build 1.1.2 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>

OpenOffice.org 1.1Beta will soon been installed in
${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org-1.1.2

1 User installation
-------------------

Just type "openoffice" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed
OO.org dir in hour homedir, you'll be prompted to
install some files and choose a installed JDK.
The setup installs a "OpenOffice.org1.1.0" folder
in your homedir.

If the setup tells you there is already an installed
version, you may look at the file ".sversionrc" in
your homedir. In this file OpenOffice and StarOffice
have both a line for each version which is installed.
After removing the problematic line you should be able to
install again.

2 Start OO.org
--------------

There are some wrappers installed for fast startup.
Add "${PREFIX}/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1.2
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1.2-sagenda
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1.2-scalc
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1.2-sdraw
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1.2-setup

3 Setup problems (FreeBSD < 4.7-RELEASE only)
---------------------------------------------

If the setup complains about a missing file "setup.ins",
it's time to upgrade your FreeBSD system to the latest
version. You will encounter this bug only if your OS is
older than FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.

4 Crashes in URL-location bar (FreeBSD < 4.7-RELEASE only)
----------------------------------------------------------

OO.org can crash if you enter a non existing path
or URL in the location bar. To fix these crashes
you need the following patch. You will see this
bug only if your OS is older than FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.
