OpenOffice.org %%RELEASE_NR%% will soon been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1 User installation
-------------------

Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed
OO.org dir in your homedir, you'll be prompted to
install some files and choose a installed JDK.
The setup installs a "OpenOffice.org%%RELEASE_NR%%" folder
in your homedir.

If the setup tells you there is already an installed
version, you may look at the file ".sversionrc" in
your homedir. In this file OpenOffice and StarOffice
have both a line for each version which is installed.
After removing the problematic line you should be able to
install again.

2 Start OO.org
--------------

There are some wrappers installed for fast startup.
Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/openoffice.org
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sagenda
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-setup
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sfax
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-spadmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sweb
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OO.org does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.
If it is not already set, a default value is chosen.

3 If you stuck into a trouble
--------------------------------------------------
Somehow you can stuck into a trouble. 
To solve this issue, please remove the already installed
"OpenOffice.org%%RELEASE_NR%%" dir in your homedir and remove the
appropriate entry from ".sversionrc". After you have done
this, redo the user installation and the problem will
go away.
