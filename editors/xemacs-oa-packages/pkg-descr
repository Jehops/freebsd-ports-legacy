Starting with release 21, xemacs does not come with lisp packages
any more. Instead, they are distributed separately from the main
sources.

    This port provides a set of the oa category packages provided by
xemacs.org(www.xemacs.org) except for basic and mule-basic packages(those are
editors/xemacs-packages and editors/xemacs-mule-basic-packages ports
respectively).

To install other categories' packages, use editors/xemacs-*-packages
ports/packages.
