OpenOffice.org %%RELEASE_NR%%m%%MILESTONE%% will soon been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1. User installation
--------------------

Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed
OO.org dir in your homedir, you'll be prompted to
install some files and choose an installed JDK.
The setup installs a ".openoffice.org%%RELEASE_NR%%.%%MILESTONE%%" folder
in your homedir.

If the setup tells you there is already an installed
version, you may look in the file ".sversionrc" located
in your homedir. In this file, OpenOffice and StarOffice
will have a line for each version that is installed.
After removing the problematic line you should be able to
install the package again.

2. Starting OO.org
------------------

There are some wrappers installed for faster startup.
Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sagenda
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-setup
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sfax
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-spadmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sweb
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OO.org does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.

3. If you run into problems
--------------------------------------------------
If you somehow run into problems, please remove the already installed
".openoffice.org%%RELEASE_NR%%.%%MILESTONE%%" dir in your homedir
along with the appropriate entry in ".sversionrc". Redo the user
installation and the problems should go away.
