OpenOffice has now been installed in ${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org641.

Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as the user
that you usually use. Then run "make install-user" and do
a standard workstation Thereafter, OpenOffice can be started using the
${PREFIX}/bin/soffice command.

Please note that this software should be considered alpha quality
at the moment, i.e. take extra care when using it in production
environments.
