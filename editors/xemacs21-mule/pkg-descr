This is a package containing only the executables for xemacs-20.4, the
next generation of Emacs.

You need to install a package, xemacs-common-20.4, containing emacs
lisp files, info pages, and so on (except executables) for
xemacs-20.4.

This package is not built with any particular language support.  If
you want a built-in input method, look into the xemacs ports in
language- specific directories.  Currently only Japanese (SKK,Canna, SJ3,
Wnn4 and Wnn6) is available.

This package and the package, xemacs-common-20.4 are designed *not* to 
clobber any existing emacs installation.  In particular, the
executables and man pages of etags/ctags are not installed, and the
info pages that come with the original emacs don't get installed too.
The Japanese version is build to install everything, by the way.
