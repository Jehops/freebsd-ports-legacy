Starting with release 21, xemacs does not come with lisp packages
any more. Instead, they are distributed separately from the main
sources.

    This port provides a basic package with mule for XEmacs(version over 21).
which contains basically needed packages provided by xemacs.org(www.xemacs.org)
in addition to the basic package(editors/xemacs-packages) for usual working at
XEmacs.

To install other categories' packages, use editors/xemacs-*-packages
ports/packages.
