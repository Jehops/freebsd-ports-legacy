F4L - or Flash for Linux - is an open source development environment for
Macromedia Flash, a multi-platform format (swf/svg) widely used for web
applications and vector animation. Basically, you can make interactive
eye candy for your website and any other purpose.

This software is work-in-progress -- but it mostly works.
