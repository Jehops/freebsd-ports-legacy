TEA is powerful text editor for GNU/Linux, Darwin, Mac OS X, Solaris, and
*BSD.  It depends on GTK+2 only (and GNU aspell optionally), but can be
built with support for GtkSourceView (version 1 or 2) to enable some extra
syntax highlighting power.  With an ultimately small size, TEA provides
hundreds of functions.  Some of the features include:

    - Built-in file manager (with support for archived files)
    - Spellchecker (using aspell)
    - Tabbed layout engine
    - Multiple encodings support
    - Code snippets, sessions and templates support
    - RTF-reader
    - Miscellaneous HTML tools
    - Tools for Wikipedia, DocBook, and LaTeX content editing
    - Preview in external browsers
    - Bracket matching, syntax highlighting
    - Bookmarks
    - Drag'n'drop support (with text files and pictures)
    - Built-in image viewer (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP, BMP)
    - Automatic text encoding detection for various languages
