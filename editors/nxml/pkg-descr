This is a new major mode for GNU Emacs for editing XML documents. It
supports editing well-formed XML documents and also provides
schema-sensitive editing of XML documents using RELAX NG Compact
Syntax.

To use this, you need GNU Emacs version 21.x, preferably 21.3. GNU
Emacs version 20 will not work properly, nor will XEmacs.
