StarOffice 6.0 Personal Install How-To

------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this a a BETA RELEASE of Staroffice6.0

------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:

A userinstall is handled unproperly. Staroffice tries to
write to the wrong location and doesn't handle this properly
and crashes.

Workaround:

# chmod a=rwx,+s $PREFIX/staroffice6.0/share/config/registry/instance/org/openoffice/Office

$PREFIX is in most cases "/usr/local". Adding +s on the
config directory does make it writable for later.

This should only be done as urgent workaround if you don't
want to work as root and really like to test Staroffice6.0-Beta.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You will very shortly have finished  a network install of
StarOffice 6.0. Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as
the user that you usually use. Then run "make install-user" and
do a standard workstation install. Change the install path to
$HOME/staroffice6.0. Then add $HOME/staroffice6.0/ to your path.

It will now be ready to use.

Good Luck
