TexmakerX is a plain fork of the Free LaTeX IDE Texmaker. The editor
itself has been replaced with the more powerful QCodeEdit library,
giving you a lot of extended ways to write your documents. TexmakerX
extends the Texmaker editor to add new features like interactive
spellchecking and code folding.
