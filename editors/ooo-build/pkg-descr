ooo-build is a collection of patches, artwork and build infrastructure
exists solely as a reflection of the many problems encouraging reasonably
responsive change up-stream. The process of change is painful for
any organisation, the larger the more painful. However - the size of the
problem is no excuse to not try; hence the evenutal aim is to remove the
need for ooo-build by incrementally fixing the various problems.

ooo-build arose from acute frustration with the bad-old days of OOo
process before the Child Workspace concept was introduced, it is also
fueled by a non-performant CVS server.
