If you are going to display AbiWord on the remote X server please make sure
that files from the ${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts directory available to
your remote X server and add ${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts into server's
font path. For XFree86, add the line:

FontPath "${PREFIX}/share/AbiSuite/fonts"

in the "Files" section of your /etc/XF86Config file. If you use a different
X server, please see its documentation on how to do this.

Then re-start your X server.
