Enabling Tamago
=================
  You can now tell your users to enable Tamago with Emacs 20.5 by adding

  If you use with Asian Languages, select suitable languages, such as

Japanese:	(set-language-environment "Japanese")
Korean:		(set-language-environment "Korean")
Chinese-GB:	(set-language-environment "Chinese-GB")
Chinese-CNS:	(set-language-environment "Chinese-CNS")

Tamago uses unix domain socket to connect to Canna server by default.
If you want to use Canna via unix domain socket, you need to install
japanese/yc.el, too.  Or, you may want to use inet domain socket by
following settings:

	(setq canna-hostname "localhost")
	(setq canna-server-port "canna")
