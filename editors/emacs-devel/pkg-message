Emacs 23 contains many changes relative to Emacs 22.  For
details, see the file etc/NEWS.  A few particular notes for
those who have not been following Emacs CVS development:

 - The RMAIL mail package was recently changed to use mbox
   instead of Babyl for its internal format.  This part of
   Emacs may be less stable than others; for safety, please
   back up your mail files before trying the new Rmail.

 - The default toolkit is now GTK+.  You can use WITHOUT_GTK
   to build GNU Emacs with the Lucid toolkit.
