The Custom Library for emacs.

The Custom Library is intended for use by emacs lisp programmers who
want to make their emacs packages easily customizable. It allows the
programmer to

  - declare the type for each user option,
     i.e. specify the set of legal values for each variable,
  - specify and initialize the faces used by the package, and
  - organize the user options into groups and hierarchies.

The user will then be able to customize the user options through a
helpful structured interface that resembles the property editor in
modern GUI programs.

How to use:
	M-x customize
