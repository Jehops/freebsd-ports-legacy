[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Smooth iconset for KDE -- Created using Adobe Illustrator 10. If
anyone is interested in a window decoration/widget theme, and knows
how to code it, let me know -- It's already being done for GTK/Metacity,
and all it needs is someone to transfer the look to QT/KWin.
 
Due to themes.freshmeat.net's upload limit, I've had to drop the
128x icons, in order to keep the file under 5mb.
