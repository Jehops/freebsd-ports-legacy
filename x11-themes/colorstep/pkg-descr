A GTK+ theme engine to make GTK+ look nicier. This theme is based on a mix of
GTKStep and Step-pastel, with a lot of tweakings. The goal was to provide
colors, a nicer look, and some configurability. This includes the following
details:

 o Flat buttons that pop out under the mouse. 
 o All buttons highlights under the mouse. 
 o Clean checkmark. 
 o Radio buttons that clearly mark which one is selected. 
 o Disabled buttons easily identifiables. 
 o Internal pixmaps follow the color scheme from the gtkrc. 
 o Multiple gtkrc files for different color combinations.
