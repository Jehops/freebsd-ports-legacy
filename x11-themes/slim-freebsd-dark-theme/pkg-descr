SLiM is an acronym for "Simple Login Manager".

Lightweight and easily configurable, SLiM requires minimal dependencies,
and none from the GNOME or KDE desktop environments. It therefore contributes
towards a lightweight system for users that also like to use lightweight
desktops such as Xfce, Openbox, and Fluxbox.

This package is a minimalist FreeBSD black/red colors theme, using
the colors defined by the FreeBSD Foundation.
