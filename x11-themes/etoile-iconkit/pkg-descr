This framework provides icon theming and various facilities to create icons at
run-time by compositing by different elements.
The icon compositing is very useful for the consistency accross a set of icons
(for example, using the same background) and permit to easily create icon
families. IconKit icon themes are a complement to Camaelon widget themes.
