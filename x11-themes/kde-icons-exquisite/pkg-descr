[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Exquisite is a port of the Xp_Mad icon set created byMimin Ladha.
Additional icons by Ghast (action icons) were added to complete the
icon set, but additinal releases will follow. This icon set uses a
modified version of the build script created by Nick Bargnesi. As
a result, the download is only 2 MB instead of 10 MB(Yes, I still
have love for 56k users). The only tools required to create the
entire icon set are bzip, tar, and convert (ImageMagik). Unpackage
the Exquisite.tar.bz2 compressed file and run the included script
buildset (./buildset - for newbies). Afterwards, use the Kcontrol
center to install the icon set. Please provide some feed back about
the icon set. I hope most people like it. If not, give me a good
vote anyway :-)
