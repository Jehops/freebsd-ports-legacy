[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

"Steel Icons" is an icon set for KDE comprised of Steel/Silver icons
with shadows.

I know everybody loves the Crystal/Aquafusion/Marbles Icons (with
the exception of aquafusion, I do -- its just too blue!  :) but I
saw Metrope, and thought, wow, those don't look like they're trying
to be OS X, they look like, well, like Linux (actually, like KDE;
I hate Gnome's look, it just looks childish).

So I set out to design some icons that weren't based on OS X,
Windows, or who-knows what else.  Tell me what you think, please.
