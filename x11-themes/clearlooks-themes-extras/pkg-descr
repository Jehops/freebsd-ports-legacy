There are currently twentyone color schemes. Eight are modified versions of
previous color schemes by me, clearlooks-devel, and Ubuntu, where I've made
the widgets a little darker while allowing the scrollbars to remain the normal
background color (more or less). These include, and in the future may not be
limited to:

Clearlooks-4Humans
ClearlooksM
Clearlooks-DeepSkyM
Clearlooks-OliveM
Clearlooks-Decaf_Coffee
Clearlooks-Gull
Clearlooks-Lucidity


Others are:
Clearlooks-Ana
Clearlooks-Bluey (Bluecurve)
Clearlooks-Coffee
Clearlooks-Etiquette
Clearlooks-Glider
Clearlooks-Lila
Clearlooks-Milk
Clearlooks-Nuvola
Clearlooks-Phacile_blue
Clearlooks-Ubuntu
