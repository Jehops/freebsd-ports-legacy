[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

I started the Cezanne Icon Theme because I found that, although there
were loads of great application icons out there (which are actually
more difficult to do), there was a paucity of Linux-oriented mimetype
icons. In my opinion, visually differentiating various filetypes
is one of the primary purposes of icons in any GUI. Subsequently,
as I got into the process, I decided to do icons for applications,
devices, and folders too. Thus, the idea of an icon theme was born!
