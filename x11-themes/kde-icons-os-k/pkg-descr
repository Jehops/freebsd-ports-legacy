[ excerpt from developer's web site with modifications ]

This is the most comprehensive icon set for KDE. Not only does it
take the best icon art and combine it into an attractive set, it
also uses a fine balance of photo realism and simplicity to achieve
a clear interface. The icon 'actions' folder contains nearly 300
icons designed with standardisation in mind and they are all created
to take advantage of the higher screen modes in use today. All
actions can now go up to 128x128! I would like to say a BIG thank
you to all the artists who's original art work make this set possible.
This is work in progress and I would ask for feedback from any users
who would like to input to the project. Oh, and if you like it,
remember to vote good :)
 
99% of this set is GPL now and what's not is most likely creative
commons. PLEASE abide by the licence rules, if you use icons from
this set please research and credit the appropriate people. I have
been given permission to release other peoples art work under the
GPL so respect the licence.
