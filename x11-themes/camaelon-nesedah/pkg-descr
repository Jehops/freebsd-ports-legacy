Nesedah is the default theme for Etoile, using the Camaelon theming engine. 
It is meant to be the logical successor to the interfaces of OPENSTEP and 
Mac OS 9 Platinum (or, as we like to call it, what OS X would have been 
without Aqua and gumdrop buttons).

Nesedah has been built primarily with usability and discoverability in mind. 
but it also tries to fit in with other modern interfaces.
