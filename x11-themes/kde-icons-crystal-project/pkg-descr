[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

It's a pleasure to say that, after long months waiting, the new
version of the Crystal icon set is available for the public. The
Icons were already finalized about six months ago. In fact, it was
necessary to bend the time, almost like the mythological battle
between Zeus and Kronos, so then I could finally finish the the
website redesign and launch the new set of icons.

Uncountable hours of work and some nights without sleeping were
dedicated to this project. I hope you guys enjoy the final result.
