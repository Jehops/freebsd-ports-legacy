This is an engine-gradient theme based off of the IceGradient theme by JM
Perez. It hacked to use normal scrollbars and real checkbox/radio buttons from
the Mac2 theme engine, instead of the in/out buttons of the thinice and default
theme (which i can never tell are in or out until i click one). Four different
color schemes are provided along with the theme engine: A default grey, a
thinice scheme, an emacs-like theme based off emacsdef, and a blue theme of
my own creation.
