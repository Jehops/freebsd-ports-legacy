PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation, provides
sets of tools for the parallel (as well as serial), numerical solution of PDEs
that require solving large-scale, sparse nonlinear systems of equations. PETSc
includes nonlinear and linear equation solvers that employ a variety of Newton
techniques and Krylov subspace methods. PETSc provides several parallel sparse
matrix formats, including compressed row, block compressed row, and block
diagonal storage.
