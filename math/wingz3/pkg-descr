Wingz  is  an  easy-to-use,   graphical  spreadsheet  for  business  and
technical  professionals,  that  allows users  to  create  sophisticated
presentations  and reports,  as  well as  user  interfaces and  end-user
applications.

Wingz was originally developed by Informix(R) but effective from January
30th, 1995 Informix granted exclusive distribution rights to IISC.

It is currently available for many different Unixes and Windowz together
with other applications by IISG.

The (much) older  version 142 is available separately  in the math/wingz
port.

Both this and the older ports use the linux-compat system, but hopefully
that'll be invisible to the end user.
