JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler -- a program for analysis of
Bayesian hierarchical models using Gibbs sampling not wholly unlike BUGS.

The functionality of JAGS is based on the BUGS program created by the
MRC Biostatistics Unit (http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/). There is a short
manual that describes the differences between JAGS and BUGS.

The manual is installed as /usr/local/share/doc/jags/jags_user_manual.pdf.

Some of the BUGS examples have been modified to run with JAGS, and have
been turned into a test suite.  They are installed under
/usr/local/share/examples/jags/.
