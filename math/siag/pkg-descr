SIAG (Scheme In A Grid)
=======================
Siag Office is a free office package for Unix, including word processor,
spreadsheet  and  presentation  graphics.  It   is  a  bundling  of  the
spreadsheet SIAG, the word processor PW, and the animation program Egon.

		The motto: "It sucks less!"

Includes tsiag  (the spreadsheet), that  works with ncurses  library for
X-impaired.

The nice thing about  it (besides the use of Scheme) is  that all of the
sexiness of the interface is achieved  with Xaw3d -- no monsters like Qt
or GTk.
