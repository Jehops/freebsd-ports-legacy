SIAG (Scheme In A Grid)
=======================
Siag is a spreadsheet based on X and Scheme. I originally
wrote it out of frustration with the fact that almost no free,
good looking applications were available for Linux. It is
based on my old program Calc, which which I started
writing in the late -80's. 

Multiple user interfaces

In addition to the old Xt interface, Siag is now available
with two alternative user interfaces. One of them is based
on the Curses library and runs on plain text terminals. The
other is based on Gtk, used by the Gnome desktop project. 
All versions of Siag have the same fundamental
functionality.
