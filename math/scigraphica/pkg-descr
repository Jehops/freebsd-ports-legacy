SciGraphica is a scientific application for data analysis and technical
graphics. It pretends to be a clone of the popular commercial (and expensive)
application "Microcal Origin". Although it is in a very early development
stage, it fully supplies plotting features for 2D charts. The aim is to obtain
a fully-featured, cross-plattform, user-friendly, self-growing scientific
application. It is free and open-source, released under the GPL license.

Main features:
--------------
 o You can open several worksheets and plots and work with them at the same
   time.
 o The plots are fully configurable using a control panel dialog.
 o The look and feel is completely WYSIWYG.
 o Publication quality PostScript output. 
 o You can interact with the plots double-clicking, dragging and moving objects
   with the mouse.
 o Import/Export features in XML format.
 o You can insert Python expressions in the worksheets.
