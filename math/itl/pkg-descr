              The Iterative Template Library Alpha Release

The Iterative Template Library (ITL) has two parts, iterative solvers
and preconditioners. ITL provides a collection of sophisticated Krylov
subspace iterative solvers that use basic linear algebra packages such
as the Matrix Template Library or Blitz++ for its basic linear algebra
operations. The ITL has extended many of the ideas of the Iterative
Methods Library (IML++), to make the library more flexible.  The
"interface" is to specify basic linear algebra operations. See next
bullet for details. On the other hand, ITL also provides a set of
preconditioners which are designed for Matrix Template Library.

The latest documentation for ITL can be found on our website:
