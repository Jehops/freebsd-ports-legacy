  Auto Payment Calculator is a simple, xforms based, application for 
use under the X-windows system, that calculates auto loan payments.
  As it is free software, it comes with NO WARRANTIES of any kind. 
  
  It is pretty straight forward. You enter the Principal (Amount),
Term (in months), and Rate, and then with either [RETURN] 
(or [enter] or whatever your keyboard equivelent is),  (ALT-C), or 
clicking the calculate button; you will have the payment in months,
as well as number of weeks, and weekly payment.

  You may also [TAB] through the Amount, Term, and Rate, as well as
hold down ALT and press the character in its Name that is underlined
to go do that function. As long as all three are filled in, you may
hit [ENTER] to Calculate right there. This makes it easy to cycle
quickly through numerous terms, amounts, and rates.

  Should there be any comment on this software desireing future
enhancements, they will likely occur. Otherwise, It will likely 
stay as it is.. It now belongs to the world for use, and is at 
their mercy :)
