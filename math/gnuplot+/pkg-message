* Wishes from The Author
*
* The author wishes many people to use a word `Hacker' and a `Cracker'
* correctly. This is just a WISH, not obligation, of course.
*
* The thought is based on
*
*     RFC (Request For Comments) 1983 "Internet Users' Glossary",
*
* from which the sections about Hacker and Cracker are quoted below.
*
*  cracker
*     A cracker is an individual who attempts to access computer systems
*     without authorization.  These individuals are often malicious, as
*     opposed to hackers, and have many means at their disposal for
*     breaking into a system.  See also: hacker, Computer Emergency
*     Response Team, Trojan Horse, virus, worm.
*
*  hacker
*     A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
*     internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
*     particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
*     where "cracker" would be the correct term.  See also: cracker.
