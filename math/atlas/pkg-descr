The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is
an ongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques
in order to provide portable performance. 

At present, it provides C and Fortran77 interfaces to a
portably efficient BLAS implementation, as well as a few routines from LAPACK.

PLEASE REBUILD YOUR KERNEL WITH 
options         CPU_ENABLE_SSE
TO ENABLE SSE1/SSE2 SUPPORT BEFORE MAKING ATLAS!
IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PERFORMANCE. 

If you use blas, you can simply change flags when linking,
from -lblas to -lf77blas -latlas -lblas (order is important)
get a significantly performance increase.

LAPACK subroutines are partially implemented.
You change from -llapack to -lalapack to get better performance.
