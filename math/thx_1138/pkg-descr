THX-1138

From the software readme:

THX-1138 is the calculator you've always wanted, short of handwriting
recognition.

THX-1138 (pronounced "thex") provides a calculator and the ability
to plot functions.

I chose the name as a tribute to the character in George Lucas'
movie.  Free software and old SF movies do not compete, and I
encourage everybody to rent the movie, but if anybody still wants
to sue me, please remember that I don't have enough money to make
it worth the trouble, so just notify me, and I'll change the name.
