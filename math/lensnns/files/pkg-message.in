For quick instructions, type

	man lensnns

---

To use the default configuration, set the environment variable LENSDIR to

        %%DATADIR%%

As an alternative to manual setup shown above, this port (and many other MRI
ports) include configuration scripts to automaticaly perform this setup.
Using these scripts, a single addition to your shell's startup script will
automatically configure the environment for all MRI ports that include
a configuration script.

To utilize these scripts in C-shell compatible shells, add the following
to your .cshrc:

foreach script (%%PREFIX%%/etc/mri/*.cshrc)
    source ${script}
end

For Bourne-shell compatibles, add the following to your .profile:

for script in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mri/*.profile; do
    . ${script}
done

---

If you want to customize your environment, make a complete copy of

        %%DATADIR%%

and set LENSDIR to the full pathname of your copy.
