========================================================================
On 11.1 and later, there is a problem downloading R packages when
gfortran is chosen as the fortran compiler.

Use either of these workarounds until a permanent solution is found.

1. If you are on an amd64 system, you can use flang as the fortran
   compiler.

2. If you choose gfortran as the fortran compiler, you can add

   options(download.file.method="wget")

   to ~/.Rprofile followed by a newline.
