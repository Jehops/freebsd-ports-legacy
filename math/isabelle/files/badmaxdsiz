! The system process data segment value is too low!                  !
!                                                                    !
! Under these circumstances the Isabelle build process for logics    !
! such as HOL will not terminate, or otherwise fail.                 !
!                                                                    !
! The setting may be viewed and modified with the commands:          !
!   sh:  ulimit -Hd                                                  !
!   csh: limit -h datasize                                           !
!                                                                    !
! It may be necessary to lift the maximum limit. One way of doing    !
! this is to add a line to /boot/loader.conf and then to restart the !
! system:                                                            !
!    kern.maxdsiz="896M"                                             !
!                                                                    !
! This problem only affects Poly/ML. Isabelle may also be configured !
! to use SML/NJ (build with WITH_SMLNJ=yes).                         !
