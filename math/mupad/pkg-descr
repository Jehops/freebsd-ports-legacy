Mupad is a sophisticated computer algebra system,
an alternation for Mathematica and Maple.
Mupad can handle not only algebraic calculation like integration, 
differentiate and matrix manipulation,
but also numerical calculations, and draw a beautiful graphs.
Unfortunately, we *CANNOT* obtain free single-user licenses for
non-commercial educational and research use anymore.
