RPC is a full-screen console-based RPN calculator that uses the curses
library.  Its operation is similar to that of modern HP calculators,
but data entry has been optimized for efficiency on a PC keyboard.  Its
features include extensive scientific calculator functionality, command
completion, and a visible interactive stack.
