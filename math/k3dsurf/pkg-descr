by using Mathematical equations. It's also a "Modeler" for POV-Ray in the
area of parametric surfaces.

Features :
* 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D HyperObjects visualization.
* Full support of all functions (like C language).
* Support of mouse event in the drawing area (Left:Rotate, Right:scale
  and Midle:translate).
* Animation an Morph effect.
* Povscript and Mesh file generation(and Run if povray is installed).
  VRML2 and OBJ files also supported.
