This port contains ten types of distributions supplementing
those built into R: Inverse Gauss, Kruskal-Wallis,
Kendall's Tau, Friedman's chi squared, Spearman's rho,
maximum F ratio, the Pearson product moment correlation
coefficient, Johnson distributions, normal scores and
generalized hypergeometric distributions. In addition,
two random number generators of George Marsaglia are
included.

The port is supplemented by an R benchmark based upon the
work of Grosjean, Steinhaus, et al.
