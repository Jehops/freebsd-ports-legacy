Polymake is a versatile tool for the algorithmic treatment of
polytopes and polyhedra.  It offers an unified interface to a wide
variety of algorithms and free software packages from the computational
geometry field, such as convex hull computation or visualization tools.

The 2.9 series are test versions towards the "next generation" polymake.
They introduce an interactive shell, the XML-base file format, more
efficient C++/perl interface, and many other new features.
