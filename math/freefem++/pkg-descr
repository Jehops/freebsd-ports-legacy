FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite element
method.

It provides you a way to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDE) simply.
Problems involving partial differential equations (pde) of  several branches
of physics such as fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of
data on several meshes and their manipulation within one program. In this
report we build on a fast quadtree-based interpolation algorithm, propose
a language for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes (generated with
bamg) and test by designing an extension of freefem and of freefem+.

Suggested add-on: the port graphics/xd3d.
