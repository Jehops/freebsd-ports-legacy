Scilab is a scientific software package for numerical computations in a
user-friendly environment. It features:

   Elaborate data structures (polynomial, rational and string matrices,
      lists, multivariable linear systems,...).
   Sophisticated interpreter and programming language with Matlab-like syntax.
   Hundreds of built-in math functions (new primitives can easily be added).
   Stunning graphics (2d, 3d, animation).
   Open structure (easy interfacing with Fortran and C via online
      dynamic link).
   Many built-in libraries:
        Linear Algebra (including sparse matrices, Kronecker form,
      	 ordered Schur,...).
        Control (Classical, LQG, H-infinity,...).
        Package for LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities) optimization.
        Signal processing.
        Simulation (various ode's, dassl,...).
        Optimization (differentiable and non-differentiable, LQ solver).
        Metanet (network analysis and optimization).
   Symbolic capabilities through Maple interface.

Note: To configure your local printers, add their names to the PRINTERS
 variable in the scilab script.
