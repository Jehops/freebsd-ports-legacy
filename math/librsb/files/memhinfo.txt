This port needs information about the memory cache system before building.
You can set this in the variable RSB_USER_SET_MEM_HIERARCHY_INFO, for example
make RSB_USER_SET_MEM_HIERARCHY_INFO="L2:12/64/3M,L1:64/8/32K"
Finding these values is tricky, but the following steps will help:
	1. read the README file in the source code
	2. build the port misc/cpuid
	3. run the program cpuid
You are on your own in figuring out how to convert the information from the
program cpuid to the value of RSB_USER_SET_MEM_HIERARCHY_INFO.
