The names of the input and output files are hard-coded. You must have:

- the computation configuration (Mach, Reynolds,...) in file a 'DATA';

- the mesh in a file 'MESH'.

Put these files in a working directory (see the examples), cd to this
directory, and run NSC2KE. The example gnu.data shows you how to visualize
the results by typing 'gnuplot < gnu.data'.
