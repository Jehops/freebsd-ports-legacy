LAPACK is a library of Fortran 77 subroutines for solving
the most commonly occurring problems in numerical linear algebra.
It is freely-available software, and is copyrighted.

LAPACK is available on netlib and can be obtained via the World Wide
Web and anonymous ftp.

   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

The complete package, including test code and timing programs in four
different Fortran data types (real, complex, double precision, double
complex), contains some 805,000 lines of Fortran source and comments.
You will need approximately 33 Mbytes to read the complete tape.
We recommend that you run the testing and timing programs.

A README file containing the information in this letter is located
in the LAPACK directory. Postscript and LaTeX versions of the Quick
Installation Guide are in the LAPACK/INSTALL directory, in the files
lawn81.tex, psfig.tex, lawn81.ps, and org2.ps.  Consult the Installation
Guide for further details on installing the package and on what is contained
in each subdirectory.  For complete information on the LAPACK Testing
and Timing Suites please consult LAPACK Working Note 41 "Installation
Guide for LAPACK".

The Fortran90 interface to LAPACK is available, as well as an f2c'ed
version of LAPACK, and a C++ version of a subset of LAPACK routines.
