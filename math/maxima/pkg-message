When built with sbcl, maxima imposes a default memory
limit of 512MB on i386.  A limit can be imposed on other
architectures, or changed on i386, by defining
DYNAMIC_SPACE_SIZE appropriately in the build environment.
The limit can be overridden at runtime, via the
-X/--lisp-options option, or by defining the environment
variable MAXIMA_LISP_OPTIONS.
