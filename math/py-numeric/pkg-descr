The Numeric Extensions to Python (NumPy) give Python the number crunching
power of numeric languages like Matlab and IDL while maintaining all of the
advantages of the general-purpose programming language Python.

These extensions add two new object types to Python, and then include a
number of extensions that take advantage of these two new objects.

  * Multidimensional Array Objects
       + Efficient arrays of homogeneous machine types
       + Arbitrary number of dimensions
       + Sophisticated structural operations
  * Universal Function Objects
       + Supports mathematical functions on all python objects
       + Very efficient for Array Objects
  * Simple interfaces to existing numerical libraries:
       + Linear Algebra (LAPACK)
       + Fourier Transforms (FFTPACK)
       + Random Numbers (RANLIB)

To use the numeric extension, add /usr/local/share/python1.4/NumPy
to your PYTHONPATH.
