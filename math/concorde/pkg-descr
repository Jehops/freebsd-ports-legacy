Concorde's TSP solver has been used to obtain the optimal solutions to
all TSPLIB instances having up to 13,509 cities.

The Concorde callable library includes over 700 functions permitting
users to create specialized codes for TSP-like problems.  All Concorde
functions are thread-safe for prgramming in shared-memory parallel
environments; the main TSP solver includes code for running over
networks of unix workstations.
