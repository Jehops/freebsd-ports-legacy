Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL.
It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common
Python-based interface.

Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab.

This port is a work in progress.  It creates a sage that is mostly functional,
but it does fail a few tests.  Suggestions for improvement to the maintainer
are welcome.
