DISLIN is a high-level library of subroutines  and functions  that display
data graphically. It is intended to be a powerful and easy to use software
package for programmers and scientists  that does not require knowledge of
hardware features. The software is available for the programming languages
C, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, Perl, Python and Java.

DISLIN can  display graphic information  directly on graphic terminals  or
store them in metafiles.  The supported display types are VGA,  X Windows,
Windows API  and Tektronix.  The supported file formats are  GKSLIN,  CGM,
HPGL, PostScript, Prescribe, WMF, PNG, BMP and TIFF. DISLIN metafiles  can
either be printed on various devices using the  DISLIN driver program DIS-
DRV or imported into third party products such as TeX and MS Word.
