A Perl module that performs the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
multiple data sets with varying numbers of elements by computing the
F-ratio.

The F-ratio is defined as the mean square between (the variance between
the means of each data set) divided by the mean square within (the mean
of the variance estimates).
