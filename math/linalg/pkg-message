Don't forget to compile and run verification/validation code: gmake check-all
or specifically, sub-targets
	vmatrix vvector vmatrix1 vmatrix2 vlastreams
	vali vhjmin vfminbr vzeroin
	vsvd vslesing sample_ult sample_adv
	sample_fill tslesing tpseudo-inv

See comments in a LinAlg/Makefile for details, as well as NumMath.dr.
The verification code checks to see that all the functions in this
package have compiled and run well. The validation code can also serve
as an illustration of how package's classes and functions may be
employed.
