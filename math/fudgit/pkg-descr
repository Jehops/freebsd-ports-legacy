FUDGIT is a double-precision multi-purpose fitting program.
It can manipulate complete columns of numbers in the form
of vector arithmetic. FUDGIT is also an expression language
interpreter understanding most of C grammar except pointers.
Morever, FUDGIT is a front end for any plotting program supporting
commands from stdin. It is a nice mathematical complement to
GNUPLOT, for example.

The main features of FUDGIT are:
   - Command shell including history;
   - Possible abbreviation of all the ``fitting mode'' commands;
   - Possible plural when it makes sense too;
   - Interactive shell supporting flow control (while,
     if-else-endif, foreach);
   - User definable macros;
   - User definable aliases;
   - On-line help;
   - On-line loadable procedure- or function-objects;
   - On-line selectable plotting program;
   - Fourier transforms;
   - Spline interpolation;
   - Smoothing;
   - Double-precision built-in calculator;
   - Built-in interpreter supporting most of C language including
     flow control (if, else, while, for, break, continue);
   - User definable functions and procedures;
   - Double-precision vector arithmetic;
   - Access to the complete C math library;
   - Access to any external C or FORTRAN routines/libraries
     through dynamic loading;
   - Built-in fitting series such as:
       + power series (polynomial);
       + sine series;
       + cosine series;
       + Legendre polynomials;
       + series of Gaussians;
       + series of exponentials;
       + series of lorentzian;
   - User definable fitting functions;
   - Totally dynamical allocation of variables and parameters;
   - Possible selection of fitting ranges;

FUDGIT has a collection of fitting routines including:
   - straight line (linear) least squares;
   - straight line (linear) least absolute deviation;
   - general linear least squares using QR decomposition;
   - general linear least squares using singular value decomposition;
   - nonlinear Marquardt-Levenberg method;
