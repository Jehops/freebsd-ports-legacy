The basic geometry and math libraries used in ROS.

angles:
Provides a set of simple math utilities to work with angles. The utilities cover
simple things like normalizing an angle and conversion between degrees and
radians, but also functions to calculate things like the shortest angular
distance between two joinst space positions of your robot, with the joint motion
constrained by joint limits.

bullet:
Contains version 2.76 of the Bullet professional free 3D Game Multiphysics
Library. The Bullet library provided by this ROS package is slightly different
from the official Bullet release.

eigen:
This package contains version 2.0.15 of the Eigen C++ template library for
linear algebra.

KDL:
This package contains a recent version of the Kinematics and Dynamics Library
(KDL), distributed by the Orocos Project. For stability reasons, this package
is currently locked to revision 31715, but this revision will be updated on a
regular basis to the latest available KDL trunk.

tf:
tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames
over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree
structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc
between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time.
