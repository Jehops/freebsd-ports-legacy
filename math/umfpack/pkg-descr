A package for solving systems of sparse linear systems Ax=b, where A is 
sparse and can be unsymmetric.  There are options for choosing a good 
pivot order, factorizing a subsequent matrix with the same pivot order and 
nonzero pattern as a previously factorized matrix, and solving systems of 
linear equations with the factors (with A, L, or U; or with their 
transposes in the single/double precision versions).  Iterative 
refinement, with sparse backward error estimates, can be performed.  
Single and double precision, complex, and complex double precision 
(complex*16) routines are available.

This package also includes AMD, a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse 
matrices prior to Cholesky or LU factorization using the aproximate 
minimum degree ordering algorithm:

Note: By default this port builds the C-callable interface using the CBLAS 
interface from ATLAS, but other versions of BLAS could be used and there 
is also a FORTRAN interface available.
