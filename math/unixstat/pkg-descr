|STAT is a set of about 30 data manipulation and analysis programs
developed by Gary Perlman at the University of California, San Diego
and at the Wang Institute. The manipulation programs are general
utilities that work with other standard programs like sort. The
analysis programs compute most widely used statistics. |STAT programs
are designed with the philosophy that individual programs should be
designed as tools that do one task well and produce output suitable
for input via pipes to |STAT and other programs.  Interactive use is
supported in the command line interpreter/editor while batch files or
shell scripts provide a programming language for complex
analyses. Typical usage involves a pipeline of transformations of data
followed by input to an analysis program, summarized schematically by:

	INPUT DATA | TRANSFORM | ANALYSIS | OUTPUT RESULTS
