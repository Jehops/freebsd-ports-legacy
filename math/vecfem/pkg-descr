VECFEM is a program package for the solution of non-linear boundary value
problems by the finite element method.
VECFEM is open for arbitrary domains and a very large class of non-linear PDEs.
This allows you to run your simulation without simplifying your model.
The package uses the finite element method (FEM) to compute an approximation
of your PDE considering 1-D, 2D and 3D domains of any shape.
The equation may be a single equation or a system of coupled PDEs.
It may be steady or time-dependent. 
Examples of use are 

       heat transfer 
       flow problem 
       diffusion 
       structural analysis 
       fluid analysis
