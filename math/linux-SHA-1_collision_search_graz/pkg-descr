SHA-1 Collision Search Graz is a distributed computing project -- people 
from through out the world download and run software to band together to 
make one of the largest supercomputers in the world. Every computer makes 
the project closer to our goals.

The project is trying to see if like MD4 in 1996, MD5/RIPEMD in 2004,
and the the direct predecessor SHA-0 in 2004 also, there is a weakness
in the hash.
