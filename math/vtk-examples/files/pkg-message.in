To build and run C++ examples/tests you need to install
vtk, vtk-headers, and cmake.

To run Tcl, Python or Java examples/tests you need to install
vtk and vtk-tcl, vtk-python or vtk-java correspondingly.

Remember to set your VTK_DATA_ROOT variable to:

	 %%PREFIX%%/share/examples/vtk/VTKData

before running examples/tests.
