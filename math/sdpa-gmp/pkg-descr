The SDPA-GMP (The GMP version of SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm)
is a software package for solving semidefinite program (SDP), intended
for very hard to solve SDPs and SDPs requires ultra high accuracy.
It is based on a Mehrotra-type predictor-corrector infeasible
primal-dual interior-point method. The SDPA-GMP shares the same
features as the SDPA, excpt for calculations will be done
with multiple precision arithmetics via the GMP
(the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library).
