The package includes
libssl.a:
	My implementation of SSLv2, SSLv3 and the required code to support
	both SSLv2 and SSLv3 in the one server.
libcrypto.a:
	General encryption and X509 stuff needed by SSL but not
	actually logically part of it.  It includes routines for the following:
  Ciphers
	libdes - My libdes DES encryption.
	RC4, RC2, Blowfish, IDEA encryption
  Digests
	MD5 and MD2 message digest algorithms, fast implementations,
	SHA (SHA-0) and SHA-1 message digest algorithms,
	MDC2 message digest.  A DES based hash that is polular on smart cards.
  Public Key
	RSA encryption/decryption/generation.
	DSA encryption/decryption/generation.
	Diffie-Hellman key-exchange/key generation.
		 There is no limit on the number of bits.
  X509v3 certificates
	X509 encoding/decoding into/from binary ASN1 and a PEM.
	Program to generate RSA and DSA certificate requests and certificates.
