This is Eric Young's SSL and Crypto library. It includes

libssl.a:
	An implementation of Netscapes SSL v 2 protocol.  This library
	implements the SSL protocol.

libcrypto.a:
	General encryption and X509 stuff needed by SSL but not
	actually logically part of it.  It includes routines for the following:
	RC4 encryption,
	IDEA encryption - 4 different modes, ecb, cbc, cfb and ofb.
	SHA (SHA-0) and SHA-1 message digest algorithms,
	RSA encryption/decryption/key generation.  There is no limit
		on the number of bits.
	Diffie-Hellman key-exchange/key generation.  There is no limit
		on the number of bits.
	X509 encoding/decoding into/from binary ASN1 and a
		PEM based ascii-binary encoding which supports encryption
		with a private key.

As this is a FreeBSD port, it has been tailored to FreeBSD.  It
uses the DES, MD2 and MD5 from FreeBSD 2.2+. Earlier versions of
freebsd have a DES library that is missing bits, and SSLeay will
not compile properly. The answer is to get the latest secure/ dist.
