This module wraps the sample C++/C# code which PayPal provides for working
with Encrypted Web Payments. It contains a single function, SignAndEncrypt
which takes the plaintext form code, private key file, public key file, and
PayPal's public certificate, and will return the signed and encrypted code
needed by paypal.
