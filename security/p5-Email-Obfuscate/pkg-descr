This package provides for the obfuscation of email address in
an ostensibly superficial, attempt to thwart email address harvesters.

Currently, there are eight different "types" of email address obfuscation 
transformations that this module employs. One of these transformations is 
randomly selected and used as a basis for obfuscation when 
obfuscate_email_address() is called.
