Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase manages the hashing of passwords for Dancer apps,
allowing developers to follow best cryptography practice without having to
become a cryptography expert. It uses the bcrypt algorithm as the default,
wrapping Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt, and also supports any hashing function
provided by Digest.
