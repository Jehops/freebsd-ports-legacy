If this is the first time you use Pantera, and the first time you install
MySQL server, then this shell script can take care of the database installation
for you:
%%SCRIPTDIR%%/pantera-install.sh
otherwise, read the script carefully to see what manual steps should be done.
Too, please note for the time being Pantera is not upgrade-safe:
New versions on the port will surely destroy your configuration file 
(panteracfg.xml) and likely will not have easy migration path to data already
stored in the database.
