If vpnc under FreeBSD 4 fails with

    socket(SOCK_RAW): Protocol not supported

check your kernel configuration. The ESP protocol may be only
enabled for FAST_IPSEC (this cannot be configured together with
IPSEC). See LINT for further details.

Under FreeBSD 5 vpnc should work without any IPSEC enabled.
