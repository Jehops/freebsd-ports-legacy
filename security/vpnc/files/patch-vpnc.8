-The command \fBvpnc\-connect\fR is a helper script that will assist on
-connection invocation and routing configuration. It can also be used to manage configuration files
-for multiple VPN connections. The script can be started by the user or
-from the daemon (see \-\-script) when the connection is established. In
-the first case, it will simply run the daemon after some environment
-checks. When executed by the daemon later, it will create a minimalistic
-host route to the gateway and configures the default gateway
-configuration of Linux to run over the VPN tunnel.

-The \fBvpnc\-disconnect\fR command is used to terminate
