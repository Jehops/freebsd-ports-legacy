Kovpn is a really simple OpenVPN GUI for everyday use. It is a client only GUI, 
meaning that you cannot administrate an OpenVPN server with it (Look for kvpnc 
if you want such a program). You can use it to connect and disconnect without 
needing to open a console. You can also input username and/or password that 
might be needed.
In Short: It can do everything an end-user want's for his everyday work with
OpenVPN.
