This version of PGP combines many of the new features of PGP 5.0 with
the command line interface of PGP 2.6.x.

I ported this in an effort to get the newer code working under FreeBSD.  
The port is fairly straightforward, but my main focus was being able to build
a functioning executable.  Also, this is a port of beta code.  It seems to
work just fine, but keep in mind that it is a beta.
