GNUPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP.

Because it does not use IDEA or RSA it can be used without any
restrictions.  GNUPG is nearly in complicance with the OpenPGP draft.

Here are modules to use the depricated encodings.

	- sign and check PGP2.x signaturs
	- decode PGP2.x messages.
	- You can't encrypt to PGP2.x users.
