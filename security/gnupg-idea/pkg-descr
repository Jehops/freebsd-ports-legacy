GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP.

Because it does not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used
without any restrictions.  GnuPG is an RFC2440 (OpenPGP) compliant
application.

Here are modules to use the deprecated (and patented) encodings.

	- sign and check PGP2.x signatures
	- decode PGP2.x messages.
	- You can't encrypt to PGP2.x users.
