IDEA:
	Patented in the USA and many european countries,
	and a patent for Japan is pending.  The patent holder
	Ascom grants a non-commerical license for no charge,
	but the definition of non-commercial use is rather
	strict.  You need to buy a license if you want to use
	IDEA commercially.

RSA:	rsa is now included in gnupg >= 1.0.3
	still included for demonstration.
