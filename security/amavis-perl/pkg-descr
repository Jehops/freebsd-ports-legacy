Imagine a heterogene network environment with both UN*X and DOS / Windows/
Macintosh workstations. Now think of an UN*X server that serves Windows
and/or Macintosh workstations via a POP3 service. Would it not be nice to
ensure attachments coming via email are scanned for viruses before they reach
a system they are able to infect? Well - that is what this package is for.
It resides on the server that handles your incoming mails. When a mail
arrives, instead of being delivered via procmail directly, is parsed through
a script that extracts all attachments from the mail, unpacks (if needed)
and scans them using a professional virus scanner program.

This is a perl implementation of the mailscan.
