OpenCL aims to be a portable, easy to use, and efficient C++ crypto
library. It currently supports the following algorithms: 

    Block Ciphers: Blowfish, CAST256, CAST5, CS-Cipher, DES, GOST,
        IDEA, Luby-Rackoff, MISTY1, RC2, RC5, RC6, Rijndael, SAFER-SK128,
        Serpent, SHARK, Skipjack, Square, TEA, Threeway, Twofish, XTEA 
    Stream Ciphers: ARC4, ISAAC, SEAL 
    Hash Functions: HAVAL, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD128, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1,
        SHA2-256, SHA2-512, Tiger 
    MACs: EMAC, HMAC, MD5MAC 
    Misc: Adler32, CRC24, CRC32, Randpool, X9.17 RNG 
    Cipher Modes: CBC w/ Padding, CFB, OFB, Counter
