SFS (Self-certifying File System) is a secure, global network file
system. SFS names file systems by public keys. Every remote file
server is mounted on a self-certifying pathname--a directory of the
form /sfs/LOCATION:HOSTID, where LOCATION is a DNS hostname and
HOSTID is a cryptographic hash of a public key. This naming scheme
allows for completely decentralized control--anyone can create a
file server, and any user can access any file server from any client.
Various key management schemes can be built on top of SFS using
symbolic links to map human-readable names to self-certifying
pathnames.
