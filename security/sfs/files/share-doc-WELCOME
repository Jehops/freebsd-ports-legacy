SFS is now installed. To test your installation, try this (as root):

# /usr/local/sbin/sfscd
# cat /sfs/@sfs.fs.net,uzwadtctbjb3dg596waiyru8cx5kb4an/CONGRATULATIONS

If it worked, you will see:

You have set up a working SFS client.

Afterwards, kill sfscd:

# kill -TERM `cat /var/run/sfscd.pid`

SFS is a complex and potentially security-affecting set of programs,
and if you wish to do more with it, e.g. setting up an SFS server
of your own, it is strongly recommended that you read the documentation
fully before proceeding. Start with the documentation link on
<URL:http://www.fs.net>, and see any supplemental documentation in
/usr/local/share/doc/sfs/.

There are sample startup files for sfscd and sfssd in /usr/local/etc/rc.d,
under the name sfscd.sh.sample and sfssd.sh.sample respectively.
These startup files are not enabled by default.

NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM SFS 0.6: You should read the file
/usr/local/share/doc/sfs/README.0.7.upgrade for important information
about converting your existing SFS configuration.
