libopensc is a library for accessing SmartCard devices using PC/SC
Lite middleware package. It is also the core library of the OpenSC
project. Basic functionality (e.g. SELECT FILE, READ BINARY) should
work on any ISO 7816-4 compatible SmartCard. Encryption and decryption
using private keys on the SmartCard is possible with PKCS #15
compatible cards, such as the FINEID (Finnish Electronic IDentity)
card. Swedish Posten eID cards have also been confirmed to work.

I have also included a small patch to allow the 'IBM Smart Card Security Kit'
to be used out-of-the-box. This kit contains a card which is actually a
rebranded Gemplus GPK4000 card with a slightly different ATR.
