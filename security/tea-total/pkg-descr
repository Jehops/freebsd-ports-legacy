TEA Total is an extremely small 128 bit private key based
encryption/decryption system which uses the new variant of TEA (Tiny
Encryption Algorithm) by David Wheeler and Roger Needham of the Cambridge
Computer Laboratory.

TEA is said to be several times faster than DES, as well as being much
smaller and more secure.  It also isn't encumbered by any patents and the
reference implementation is in the public domain.
