In response to a number of distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks that
have been reported, the National Infrastructure Proctection Center (NIPC)
Special Technology Applications Unit (STAU) has developed a tool to assist in
combating this threat.  ``find_ddos'' is intended to scan a local system that
is either known or suspected to contain a DDOS program.

``find_ddos'' will detect tfn2k client, tfn2k daemon, trinoo daemon, trinoo
master, tfn daemon, tfn client, stacheldraht master, stacheldraht client,
stachelddraht demon and tfn-rush client.
