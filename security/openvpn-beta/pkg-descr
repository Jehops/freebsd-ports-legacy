This is a BETA build for OpenVPN.  This means that this port may not function
properly in a production environment, but we've made strong efforts toward
making this as releasble as possible.  Please use this port to aid OpenVPN
to test and make this next release as stable as possible.

OpenVPN is a robust, scalable and highly configurable VPN (Virtual Private
Network) daemon which can be used to securely link two or more private networks
using an encrypted tunnel over the internet. It can operate over UDP or TCP,
can use SSL or a pre-shared secret to authenticate peers, and in SSL mode, one
server can handle many clients.

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT CAUTION
