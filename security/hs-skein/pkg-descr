Skein [1] is a family of fast secure cryptographic hash functions.  This
package uses bindings to the optimized C implementation of Skein.  There
is a high-level interface provided to some of the Skein use cases, and a
low-level interface when Skein has to be used in a different way.

Currently Skein is supported as cryptographic hash function as Skein as
a message authentication code (Skein-MAC).
