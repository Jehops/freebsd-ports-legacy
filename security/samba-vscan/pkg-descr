samba-vscan is a proof-of-concept module for Samba, which uses the VFS
(virtual file system) features of Samba 2.2.x/3.0 to provide an
on-access Samba anti-virus. Of course, Samba has to be compiled with
VFS support. It currently works only with FRISK F-Prot Daemon,
Kaspersky AntiVirus, mks32, OpenAntiVirus ScannerDaemon, Sophos Sweep,
Symantec AntiVirus Engine (via ICAP) or Trend Micro.
