*****************************************************************************
You have installed the samba-vscan package.

The vfs object's is in %%PREFIX%%/lib/samba.

The configuration files is in %%PREFIX%%/etc/samba-vscan.

Edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/smb.conf and add the following entry 
(that's only an example):

  [vscan]
       comment = virus-protected /tmp directory
       path = /tmp
       vfs object = %%PREFIX%%/lib/samba/vscan-oav.so
       vfs options = config-file = %%PREFIX%%/etc/samba-vscan/vscan-oav.conf
       writeable = yes
       browseable = yes
       guest ok = yes

Basically you have to add a vfs object line to your shares
which should be virus-protected by this module. If you'd like to use the
run-time configuration file, simply add the
vfs options = config-file = /path/config-file
(different settings for several shares can be achieved by using a different
name of the configuration file for each share). If you want to protect _all_
shares your Samba server offers, simply add the vfs object line (and the
vfs options line, if you like) to the [global] section.

Then restart samba.

Important: Remember, you need to install Clamav, Fprot, Icap, Kaspersky, Mks, Openantivirus, Sophos or Trend Antivirus to samba-vscan works correctly.
