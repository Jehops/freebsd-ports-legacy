Barnyard is output spool reader for Snort! It decouples output overhead
from the Snort network intrusion detection system and allows Snort to
run at full speed. It accepts binary inputs from snort and outputs
human readable files to disc or to a database.  At present, barnyard
is designed to accept binary inputs from snort and produce either human
readable files for parsing by log parsers or feed data directly to a
database (either mysql or postgresql at present.).

Barnyard has 3 modes of operation:

One-shot, continual, continual w/ checkpoint.  In one-shot mode,
barnyard will process the specified file and exit.  In continual mode,
barnyard will start with the specified file and continue to process
new data (and new spool files) as it appears.  Continual mode w/
checkpointing will also use a checkpoint file (or waldo file in the
snort world) to track where it is.  In the event the barnyard process
ends while a waldo file is in use, barnyard will resume processing at
the last entry as listed in the waldo file.
