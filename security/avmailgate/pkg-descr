AntiVir MailGate for  FreeBSD protects your  electronic post office 
against viruses.
It is  working  with  numerous common  Mail Transport Agents (MTA), 
like  sendmail,  postfix,  qmail and exim.  Operates at high speed,
is easy to configure and  checks both incoming and outgoing emails.

AntiVir  MailGate  is  a  store-and-forward  agent,  in  which  the 
workload is shared by the two programs avgated and avgatefwd.

Avgated  receives  the  emails  and  stores  them  in  a  specified 
directory. This program can be  run as an independent server  which 
occupies port 25 (SMTP) or is  started by the  internet superdaemon
inetd.

Avgatefwd reads the temporarily  stored emails, decodes the attach-
ments and initiates the virus scan.  If no viruses are found in the 
emails, they are forwarded immediately.

If an email is found to be infected,  it will not be forwarded.  In 
this case, the postmaster receives an e-mail with a detailed report, 
and the sender and recipient are also notified of the infection.
