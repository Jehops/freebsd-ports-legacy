Figaro's Password Manager is a GNOME application that allows you to securely
store your passwords. Features include:

* Passwords are encrypted with the blowfish algorithm.
* Copy passwords or usernames to the clipboard.
* Copy passwords or usernames to the primary selection. (And paste them with a
middle mouse button click).
* If the password is for a website, FPM can keep track of the URLs of your
login screens and can automatically launch your browser. In this capacity, FPM
acts as a kind of bookmark manager.
* You can teach FPM to launch other applications, and optionally pass
hostnames, usernames or passwords to the command line.
* FPM also has a password generator that can help you choose good passwords.
It allows you to determine how long the password should be, and what types of
characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols) should be used. You
can even have it avoid ambiguous characters such as a capital O and the number
0.
