- Universal server building block (OpenXPKI) for arbitrary PKI installed. 
- SCEP prerequisite binary and i18n tools for UI installed.
- Enable utf8 locale (e.g. en_US.utf8) for the translation staff to operate
  (translation is needed even for English language).
- Install your favorite database (enable utf8 support), 
  e.g. databases/mysql56-server
  Install perl interface for your favorite database, 
  e.g. databases/p5-DBD-mysql
- Install your favorite web server.
  This port has created user:group as openxpki:openxpki
  Add a line: "User openxpki" to configuration of your OpenXPKI-related 
  web server. Choose from two versions of the handler: based on CGI or FastCGI
  perl core modules.
- Perform deployment procedure for OpenXPKI in a regular way, 
  without this OpenXPKI server would not start.
- Start daemons in this order:
    database server,
    OpenXPKI server (%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openxpki start),
    web server.
- Docs installed (if you opted so) into %%DOCSDIR%%
- If you want your PKI server to act as the simplest CA, 
  then copy sample configuration for this case with 
    cp -R %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/openxpki/* %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki/
  and follow advice at:
  https://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html
- Mind FreeBSD specific file structure:
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki: server configuration, logs configuration.
    /var/openxpki: pid file, socket file, ...
    /var/openxpki/session: session files.
    /var/log/openxpki: server log files.
    /var/tmp: temporary directory.
