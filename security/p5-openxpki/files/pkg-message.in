==================================================================
- Universal server building block (OpenXPKI) for arbitrary PKI: installed. 
- SCEP prerequisite binary and i18n tools for UI: installed.
- Enable utf8 locale (e.g. en_US.utf8) for the translation staff to operate
  (translation is needed even for English language).
- Install your favorite database (enable utf8 support), 
  e.g. databases/mysql56-server
- Install perl interface for your favorite database, 
  e.g. databases/p5-DBD-mysql
- Install your favorite web server.
  This port has created user:group as openxpki:openxpki
  Add a line: "User openxpki" to configuration of your OpenXPKI-related 
  web server. Choose from two versions of the handler: based on CGI or FastCGI
  perl core modules.
- Perform deployment procedure (define a role of the server inside the PKI
  infrastructure) for OpenXPKI server in a regular way, 
  without this procedure OpenXPKI server would not start.
  E.g. if you want your server to act as the simplest CA, 
  then copy sample configuration for this case with 
    cp -R %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/openxpki/* %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki/
  and follow advice at:
  https://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html
- Start daemons in this order:
    database server,
    OpenXPKI server (%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openxpki start),
    web server.
- Docs installed (if you opted so) into %%DOCSDIR%%
- Mind FreeBSD specific file structure:
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki: server configuration, logs configuration.
    /var/openxpki: pid file, socket file, ...
    /var/openxpki/session: session files.
    /var/log/openxpki: server log files.
    /var/tmp: temporary directory.
