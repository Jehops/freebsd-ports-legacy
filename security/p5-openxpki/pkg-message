================================ A piece of advice ===================================
- Install port security/p5-i18n (needed for English interface too).
- Install your favorite database (enable utf-8 support if needed) and a web server.
- Perform deployment procedure for openxpki in a regular way.
- When asked for the name of the "openxpki user" answer "openxpki",
  and do not forget to add a line: "User openxpki" to the zone of your
  OpenXPI-related (virtual) web server in your web server configuration file.
