Nikto is a web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web 
servers for multiple items, including over 2200 potentially dangerous 
files/CGIs, versions on over 140 servers, and problems on over 210 servers.
Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated
(if desired).

Nikto is designed to examine web servers and look for items in multiple 
categories:

- misconfigurations
- default files and scripts
- insecure files and scripts
- outdated software

It uses Rain Forest Puppy's LibWhisker (wiretrip.net) for HTTP functiona lity,
and can perform checks in HTTP or HTTPS.  It also supports basic port scanning
 and will determine if a web server is running on any open ports.
