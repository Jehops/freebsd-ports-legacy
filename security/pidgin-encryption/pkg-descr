Gaim-Encryption uses NSS to provide transparent RSA encryption as a Gaim plugin.

Features include:
	* Automatically creates a public/private key pair for you upon loading
	  the plugin
	* Automatically transmits your public key to other users.
	* Supports 512 - 4096 bit keys.
	* Saves keys of known users, and warns you if their public key has
	  changed.
	* Embeds all encryption and keys inside HTML, so if the other user
	  doesn't have the plugin, they will get a little message telling them
	  about the plugin, and won't get a screen full of garbage.
	* Stores keys in human readable files in your .gaim directory, in case
	  you ever need to copy/edit them by hand. Which you really shouldn't
	  have to do.
	* Automatically recognizes if you are chatting with someone who has the
	  plugin- see the Preferences dialog.
	* Modular and extensible. If you want to define a different type of
	  encryption, you can use this plugin as a wrapper to take care of
	  transporting the encrypted binary over the IM pipe.
