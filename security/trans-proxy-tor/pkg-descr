trans-proxy-tor is a transparent proxy
that uses PF to redirect TCP connections
through Tor (http://tor.eff.org/).

Programs that aren't aware of Tor
will use it without their knowledge,
and their traffic no longer leaves the
system unencrypted.

Using trans-proxy-tor makes anonymous
net usage a lot easier, as you no longer
have to configure every program for itself.
