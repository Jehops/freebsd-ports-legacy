MOSREF is an exploitation architecture utilizing the power of the MOSVM virtual
machine and Mosquito Lisp to make penetration testing, exploit development,
and general systems security tasks more efficient.

While MOSREF has been developed primarily as a platform for exploitation and
penetration-testing, MOSREF and the underlying MOSVM virtual machine technology
can be used for a variety of security-related and non-security-related tasks.
Moreover, the platform is licensed under the GNU LGPL, and is redistributable
and modifiable under the terms of that license.
