This is the IFD driver for the Gemplus GPR400 PCMCIA Smart Card Reader,
written by Joe Phillips <joe.phillips@innovationsw.com>. This particular
reader has been rebranded as part of the IBM SecureWay Smart Card Kit.

It requires the pcsc-lite library in order to build and be useful. Once you
have installed and configured this IFD driver on your system, you should
be able to access the device using CITI's libsectok library, if compiled
with pcsc-lite support.
