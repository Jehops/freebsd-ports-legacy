# Each entry consists of a single line containing the following three
# fields in the order named, separated with the pipe (`|') character:
#
#     Package:    A pattern that matches the name of the vulnurable
#                 package, see `man -M /usr/local/man pkg_info'.
#     Reference:  An URL where an advisory can be found
#     Reason:     The type of vulnurability found
#
# Keep this list sorted in the chronological order.  New entries must
# be added at the end, old entries shouldn't be removed; this should
# document *all* known package vulnerabilities. 
#
# This file does not have any designated maintainer, so feel free to
# commit to it yourself.  However, it is generally a good idea to
# notify the maintainer of the affected package(s)
