TrueCrack is a brute-force password cracker for TrueCrypt (Copyright) volume
files. It works on Linux and it is optimized with Nvidia Cuda technology.
It works with cripted volumes with the following algorithms:

- PBKDF2 (defined in PKCS5 v2.0) based on RIPEMD160 Key derivation function.
- XTS block cipher mode of operation used for hard disk encryption based on
  AES.

TrueCrack can work in two different modes of use:

- Dictionary attack: read the passwords from a file of words (one password
  for line).
- Charset attack: generate the passwords from a charset of symbols defined
  by the user (for example: all possible strings of n characters from the
  charset "abc" ).
