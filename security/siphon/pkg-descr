Siphon is a passive OS fingerprinter which sniffs network traffic passing
the local machine and uses characteristics of the TCP stream to identify
the operating system running on the endpoints.

In contrast to active fingerprinters like nmap and queso, no additional
connections need to be made to the target system in order to fingerprint it.
