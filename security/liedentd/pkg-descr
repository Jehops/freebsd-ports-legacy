This ident daemon runs as a standalong daemon and lies about users.  By
default, a random string is returned for each ident request, in order to
preserve the security of your system.  The name returned and the OS name
may be specified on the command line.

When run on a NAT router, this server simplifies the problem of using IRC
through a NAT network.
