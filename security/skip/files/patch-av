+Some notes regarding the FreeBSD port of SKIP
+December 8, 1997
+
+- Much of the non-man page documentation has NOT be patched to reflect
+  the different locations of files, etc. The main difference is that the
+  original version of SKIP puts everything under /usr/skip, whereas the
+  FreeBSD port has put it under @@PREFIX@@. This documentation can be
+  found in @@PREFIX@@/share/doc/skip.
+
+- Thanks to Stephanie Wehner, skiphost now takes a new argument for specifying
+  the source address for encrypted packets. This allows encrypted packets
+  that are being tunnelled between two routers to have source and dest
+  IP addresses of only those two routers. This reduces firewall complexity
+  in many cases. From her description:
+
+    This adds another command line option to skiphost, namely
+    -f <source address> . Every packet going out to the other host
+    will then have this source address in the packet.
+
+- SKIP is applied to packets *after* any ipfw(8) filtering is applied.
+  This is true for both incoming and outgoing packets. Note that SKIP
+  has its own access control functionality.
+
+  One way to deal with this is to do the following:
+
+  - Setup ipfw as you normally would to restrict access to your machine.
+  - Add additional ipfw rules to allow SKIP related traffic:
+    - ipfw add 10 allow 57 from any to any
+    - ipfw add 10 allow 79 from any to any (if using SunScreen mode)
+    - ipfw add 10 allow 50 from any to any (if using raw ESP/AH mode)
+    - ipfw add 10 allow 51 from any to any (if using raw ESP/AH mode)
+    - ipfw add 10 allow udp from any to <your-address> 1640
+    - ipfw add 10 allow udp from <your-address> 1640 to any
+  - Set the default rule for SKIP to be to allow access.
+
+- Skipd will logs via syslog(3) instead of logging directly
+  to /var/log/skip.log as before, using the LOG_DAEMON facility.
+
+  You may want to redirect this output to its own log file.
+  This is done by the following steps:
+
+    1. touch /var/log/skipd.log
+    2. Edit /etc/syslog.conf and add these lines at the end:
+
+       !skipd
+       *.*		/var/log/skipd.log
+
+    3. Edit /etc/newsyslog.conf as appropriate
+    4. Restart syslogd
+
+- Each time skip is started (at reboot time), the skiphost
+  output is written to /var/log/skiphost.log. You may also
+  want to add an entry to /etc/newsyslog.conf for this one
+  as well.
+
+- Users of skip should subscribe to the SKIP mailing list
+  by sending an email to "majordomo@skip.org" containing
+  the line "subscribe skip-info".
+
+- If you have trouble:
+
+  - If there is a problem with the port itself (e.g., it won't
+    compile on your system), use send-pr(1) to send a problem report.
+
+  - If you are having trouble with SKIP configuration, use,
+    compatibility, etc., send your questions to the SKIP
+    mailing list: skip-info@skip.org (you should subscribe
+    to it first).
