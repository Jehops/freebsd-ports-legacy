  SKIP - Simple Key management for Internet Protocols

  IP-Level Cryptography
  Secure every application with one protocol 

  SKIP secures the network at the IP packet level. Any networked
  application gains the benefits of encryption, without requiring
  modification. SKIP is unique in that an Internet host can send an
  encrypted packet to another host without requiring a prior message
  exchange to set up a secure channel. SKIP is particularly well-suited
  to IP networks, as both are stateless protocols. Some of the
  advantages of SKIP include:

    - No connection setup overhead
    - High availability - encryption gateways that fail can reboot and
	resume decrypting packets instantly, without having to renegotiate
	(potentially thousands) of existing connections
    - Allows uni-directional IP (e.g., IP broadcast via satellite or cable)
    - Scalable multicast key distribution
    - SKIP gateways can be configured in parallel to perform instant-failover
