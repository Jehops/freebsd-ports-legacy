The Metasploit Project

This is the Metasploit Project. The goal is to provide useful
information to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature
development, and exploit research. This site was created to fill the
gaps in the information publicly available on various exploitation
techniques and to create a useful resource for exploit developers. The
tools and information on this site are provided for legal penetration
testing and research purposes only.

This port is an in-development version of the upcoming Metasploit Framework.
It is based on Ruby instead of perl, and has a different license.
