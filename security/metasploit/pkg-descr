                           The Metasploit Project

   This is the Metasploit Project. The goal is to provide useful
   information to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature
   development, and exploit research. This site was created to fill the
   gaps in the information publicly available on various exploitation
   techniques and to create a useful resource for exploit developers. The
   tools and information on this site are provided for legal penetration
   testing and research purposes only.

This is the stable version of Metasploit Framework. It is based on Perl, and
will be replaced in the future with Metasploit Framework version 3.
