SWATCH - The Simple WATCHer and filter

HOW TO INSTALL
	
    To install Swatch simply type "sh install.sh" and you will be prompted
for
    the information that it need to make the installation

NEW FEATURES

    * Now using the getopts.pl library as the command line parser instead
      of the non-standard library that I was using.

    * No longer writing the watcher script into a temporary file. Instead
      I store the script internally and run it inside a child process.
      This also fixed the bug where 2.1 did not remove the watcher script
      upon exit.

    * Reduced the history reporting to one line.

    * Cleaned up code to follow PERL style rules more closely.

COMING ATTRACTIONS

    * Better history handling

    * Expanded history options

    * Ability to use an easier to read configuration file

    * Color

    * One or two more actions
