.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Auto Blacklist module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category: authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
.Ss Auto Blacklist PAM Authentication Module
.Nm
provides auto blacklisting of hosts and users responsible for repeated
failed authentication attempts. Generally configured so that blacklisted
users still see normal login prompts but are guaranteed to fail to
authenticate.  This functionality is only available to services which call
PAM as root.  If
.Nm
is called for uid != 0 it will silently succeed.

The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm expose_account
Ignored.
.It Cm no_warn
suppress warning messages to the user.
These messages include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
declined.
.It Cm try_first_pass
Ignored.
.It Cm use_first_pass
Ignored.
.It Cm use_mapped_pass
Ignored.
.It Cm config Ns No = Ns Ar config-file
The configuration file contains additional arguments. In order for the
.Nm
blacklist maintenance tool to work correctly most of the configuration
should be placed in the config file rather than being provided by arguments.
The format of the config file is described below.
.It Cm host_db Ns No = Ns Ar host-database-file
Path to the Berkeley DB which is used to log the host responsible for failed
authentication attempts.
If host_db is omitted the corresponding auto blacklisting will be disabled.
.It Cm host_purge Ns No = Ns Ar time
Defines how long failed hosts are retained in the host database.
Defaults to 1 day.
.It Cm host_rule Ns No = Ns Ar host-rule
The rule (see below for format) which defines the conditions under which a
failed hosts will be blackisted.
.It Cm user_db Ns No = Ns Ar user-database-file
Path to the Berkeley DB which is used to log the user responsible for failed
authentication attempts.
If user_db is omitted the corresponding auto blacklisting will be disabled.
.It Cm user_purge Ns No = Ns Ar time
Defines how long failed users are retained in the user database.
Defaults to 1 day.
.It Cm user_rule Ns No = Ns Ar user-rule
The rule (see below for format) which defines the conditions under which a
failed users will be blackisted.
.El
.Ss Rules syntax
.Cm host_rule No Cm user_rule
are the rules which determine the circumstances under which accounts ares
auto blacklisted.
The
.Cm host_rule
is used to block access to hosts that are responsible for excessive
authentication failures and the
.Cm user_rule
is used to disable accounts for which there have been excessive
authentication failures.
Each rule consists of a number of space separated
.Sy user clauses Ns No .
A
.Sy user clause
specifies the user names and services to match and a set of triggers.
A simple example would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*:10/1h
.Ed
.Pp
which means 'block any user (*) if they are responsible for ten or more
failed authentication attempts in the last hour'.
In place of the '*' which matches any user a list of usernames can be
supplied like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
root|dba|admin:10/1h
.Ed
.Pp
which means 'block the users root, dba and admin if they are responsible
for ten or more failed authentication attempts in the last hour'.
You can also specify a service name to match against like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
root/sshd|dba/*:3/1d
.Ed
.Pp
which means 'block the users root for service sshd and user dba for any
service if they are responsible for three or more failed authentication
attempts in the last day'.
Finally you can specify multiple triggers like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
root:10/1h,20/1d
.Ed
.Pp
which means 'block the user root if they are responsible for ten or more
failed attempts in the last hour or twenty or more failed attempts in the
last day.
.Pp
Multiple rules can be provided separated by spaces like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*:10/1h root:5/1h,10/1d
.Ed
.Pp
in which case all rules that match a particular user and service will be
checked.
The user or host will be blocked if any of the rule triggers matches.
.Pp
The sense of the user matching can be inverted by placing a '!' in front
of the rule so that:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
!root:20/1d
.Ed
.Pp
is a rule which would match for all users apart from root.
.Pp
It is important to treat root as a special case in the
.Cm user_rule
otherwise excessive attempts to authenticate as root will result in the
root account being locked out even for valid holders of root credentials.
.Pp
Here is the full syntax for rules:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
word ::= /[^\\s\\|\\/\\*]+/
name ::= word | '*'
username ::= name
servicename ::= name
userservice ::= username | username '/' servicename
namelist ::= userservice | userservice '|' namelist
userspec ::= namelist | '!' namelist
multiplier ::= 's' | 'm' | 'h' | 'd'
number ::= /\d+/
period ::= number | number multiplier
trigger ::= number '/' period
triglist ::= trigger | trigger ',' triglist
userclause ::= userspec ':' triglist
rule ::= userclause | userclause /\s+/ rule
.Ed
.Pp
For rules to work correctly
.Cm host_purge No and Cm user_purge 
must be at least as long as the longest period specified in a corresponding
rule.
You may wish to retain information about failed attempts for longer than
this so that the 
.Nm
blacklist maintenance tool can report information over a longer period of
time.
The format for this items is a number with an optional multiplier suffix,
's', 'm', 'h' or 'd' which correspond with seconds, minutes, hours and days.
To specify seven days for example one would use '7d'.
Note that in normal operation
.Nm
PAM module will only purge the logged data for a particular host or user
if it happens to be updating it, i.e. if that host or user makes another
failed attempt.
To purge all old entries the 
.Nm
blacklist maintenance tool should be used.
.Ss Blacklist maintenance tool
Blacklist maintenance tool
.Nm
perform maintenance on the databases used by the
.Nm
PAM module.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Print help page and exit.
.It Fl p | Fl -purge
Purge databases according to purge rules in config.
.It Fl r | Fl -relative
Display times relative to now otherwise absolute times will be displayed.
.It Fl v | Fl -verbose
Verbose output.
.It Fl -okhost Ns No = Ns Ar host-name
Unblock host.
.It Fl -okuser Ns No = Ns Ar user-name
Unblock user.
.It Ar config-file
Name of the
.Nm
configuration file (default: %%ETCPREFIX%%/etc/pam_abl.conf).
The config file is read to discover the names of the
.Nm
databases and the rules that control purging of old data from them.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Auto Blacklist PAM module
Typically
.Nm
PAM module is added to the auth stack as a required module just before
whatever modules actually peform authentication.
Here's a fragment of the PAM config:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auth required   pam_env
auth required   pam_abl  config=%%ETCPREFIX%%/etc/pam_abl.conf
auth sufficient pam_unix likeauth nullok
auth required   pam_deny
.Ed
.Ss Blacklist maintenance tool

.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ pam_abl
.Ed
.Pp
Obtain a full list of failures listing times relative to now:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ pam_abl -rv
.Ed
.Pp
Purge old data:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ pam_abl -p
.Ed
.Pp
Unblock all example.com hosts and all users:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ pam_abl -v --okhost='*.example.com' --okuser='*'
