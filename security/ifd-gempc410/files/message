You need to add your reader to %%PREFIX%%/etc/readers.conf.  The
following is an example of a suitable entry:

FRIENDLYNAME		"GemPC410"
DEVICENAME		GEMCORE
LIBPATH			%%PREFIX%%/lib/libGemPC410.so
CHANNELID		1

You will have to adjust the CHANNELID to match the actual port that your
reader is connected to (0 for /dev/cuaa0, 1 for /dev/cuaa1 etc.)
