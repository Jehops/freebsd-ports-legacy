You may need to start the saslauthd daemon for authentication with
the system password files:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/saslauthd.sh start

or you can use sasldb2 for authentication, to add users use:

	saslpasswd2 -c username

If you want to enable SMTP AUTH with the system Sendmail, read Sendmail.README

NOTE: This port has been compiled with a default pwcheck_method of
      %%PWCHECK_METHOD%%. Set sasl_pwcheck_method to %%PWCHECK_METHOD%%,
      after installing the Cyrus-IMAPd 2.1.7 port.  You should also check
      the %%PREFIX%%/lib/sasl2/*.conf files for the correct pwcheck_method.
