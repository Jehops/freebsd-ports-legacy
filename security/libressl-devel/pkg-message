============================================================
    WARNING: THE API OF LibreSSL-devel is volatile
============================================================
 This is the latest version of LibreSSL that will change
 its API and shared library version often. This will result
 in problems if you do not manage your ports rigorously.

 This version is safe for use and provides the latest
 libtls features.

 Normally, you can obtain the list of dependent software by
 running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl-devel

 Users using poudriere will automatically rebuild all ports
 that require SSL. 

 Portmaster users:
     portmaster -r libressl-devel
 Portupgrade users:
     portupgrade -fr security/libressl-devel
