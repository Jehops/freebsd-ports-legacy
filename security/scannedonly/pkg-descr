Scannedonly is a samba VFS module and a scanning daemon that ensure that only
files that have been  scanned for viruses are visible and accessible to the end
user.

Scannedonly was developed because of scalability problems with samba-vscan: high
server loads when (the same) files were requested often, and timeouts when large
zip files were requested. Scannedonly doesn't have these problems, but it does
introduce some other issues.  Choose the product that suits you best.

Scannedonly is available under the open source GPL licence. The source code
repository is available on Sourceforge.
