java_policy14 provides JCE(Java Cryptography Extension)
Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.

Strong Cryptography Is the Default, Unlimited Is Available
  Due to import control restrictions, the jurisdiction
  policy files shipped with the Java2 SDK, v1.4 allow
  "strong" but limited cryptography to be used.  An
  "unlimited strength" version of these files indicating
  no restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available
  for those living in eligible countries (which is most
  countries).  You can download this version and replace
  the strong cryptography versions supplied with the Java2
  SDK, v1.4 with the unlimited ones.  See WWW: line for
  information indicating where to go to download the
  unlimited version.
