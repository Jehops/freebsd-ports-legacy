To enable this port, please add sshd_program=/usr/local/sbin/sshd and make
sure
sshd_enable is set to YES in your /etc/rc.conf

You may also want to put NO_OPENSSH=    true in your /etc/make.conf
and make sure your path is setup to /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin so that
you
are running the port version of openssh and not the version that comes with
FreeBSD
