This is a sample program containing some of the features of the
features of the FBI's "Carnivore" program. It is intended to serve
as a point of discussion about Carnivore features. It has not been
thoroughly tested and contains numerous bugs.

This may also serve as an "alternative" for ISPs who do not wish
to install a black-box from the FBI. Court orders demanding data
from the ISP do not necessarily require that Carnivore must be used
if the ISP is able to obtain the data in another manner.

This software may also be useful in network management, such as
backing up data or sniffing a consumer's dial-up connection when
they are reporting problems to customer support.

See the commented notes in the code for details.
