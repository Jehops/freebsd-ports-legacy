This is the i386 binary for the md5crk client.  The md5crk project aims to find
pairs of different, printable, textual strings with identical MD5 hashes,
thereby demonstrating that stronger hashing algorithms should be used when
checking for maliciously altered data.

A version for the Pentium 4 is available, but is not installed by this port.
