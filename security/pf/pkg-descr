Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system for 
filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF is also 
capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and providing bandwidth
control and packet prioritization. 

Information about pf can be found at the website of Daniel Hartmeier, the
original author of PF: http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html and OpenBSD PF FAQ:
