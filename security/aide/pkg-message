If you want to finish setting up AIDE, don't forget to create your own
aide.conf based on ${PREFIX}/etc/aide.conf.sample and then copy it to
the /var/adm/aide/ directory. You will also need to run the following
commands:

	cd /var/adm/aide
	aide --init
	mv databases/aide.db.new databases/aide.db

You may want to change the permissions of the /var/adm/aide/ directory tree.
