You may need to start the pwcheck or saslauthd daemon for authentication
with the system password files:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/pwcheck.sh start
or
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/saslauthd1.sh start

or you can use sasldb for authentication, to add users use:

	saslpasswd -c username

If you want to enable SMTP AUTH with the system Sendmail, read Sendmail.README

NOTE: This port has been compiled with a default pwcheck_method of
      %%PWCHECK_METHOD%%. Set sasl_pwcheck_method to %%PWCHECK_METHOD%%,
      after installing the Cyrus-IMAPd 1.6.24 port.  You should also check
      the %%PREFIX%%/lib/sasl/*.conf files for the correct pwcheck_method.
