This is a Java SSH Client, which has a whole bunch of features.
You should take a look at the following URL to find out:

However, this version does _not_ depend on the Java Development
Kit, since it is the binary version, which runs out-of-the-box
in webbrowsers that support Java.  A minimal sample HTML page
is installed as well.
If you want to use the client from shell, you have to install
the JDK first (${PORTSDIR}/java/jdk/).
