In order to configure Sendmail for this port add the following lines to
your SENDMAIL_MC:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(
	`antivir-milter',
	`S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
)dnl

Don't forget to rebuild sendmail.cf and to restart Sendmail afterwards.

For automated updates of the anti-virus engine and the virus definition
file either add the following line to your /etc/crontab to run them via
cron(8):
25 0 * * * root %%PREFIX%%/sbin/antivirupdater -q
or execute the following command to enabled the AntiVir Updater daemon:
cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/avupdater.sh-dist_avmilter \
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/avupdater.sh

For full functionality of AntiVir Milter you need to obtain a license
key from H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH. To install it, execute the following
commands:
cp hbedv.key %%PREFIX%%/AntiVir/
chown root:smmsp %%PREFIX%%/AntiVir/hbedv.key
chmod 440 %%PREFIX%%/AntiVir/hbedv.key

A license key for private (individual, non-commercial) use can be applied
for free of charge at:

Note:	AntiVir Milter 1.1.0-7 ships with a faulty anti-virus engine which
	may just exit with the following error when trying to start it:
	cannot access config file "/etc/avguard.conf"
	Please update to the latest anti-virus engine by e.g. running the
	antivirupdater script in order to solve this.
