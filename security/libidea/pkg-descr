IDEA is a block cipher invented by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in
1991.  A block cipher is an encryption algorithm that encrypts the
data in blocks.  IDEA has a block size of 64 bits, and a keylength of
128 bits. IDEA is a symmetrical algorithm, which means that the same
key is used both for encryption and for decryption.
