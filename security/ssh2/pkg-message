Depending on how you would like to start sshd2(8) you have three choices:
1) Copy the sample start-up script %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2.sh.sample
to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2.sh.

2) Add the following entries to your /etc/inetd.conf:
ssh stream tcp  nowait root %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshd2 sshd -i
ssh stream tcp6 nowait root %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshd2 sshd -i

3) On FreeBSD 4 only (on FreeBSD 5 with rcNG this currently doesn't work
properly) add the following entries to your /etc/rc.conf:
sshd_enable="YES"
sshd_program="%%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshd2"

NOTE: This port traditionally sets up 1) automatically unless it detects 2).
      If you want to use 2) or 3) you have to manually delete the start-up
      script %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2.sh. This version of the port is the
      last one that does 1) automatically. To prevent foot shooting when
      updating to the next version this port won't remove an existing
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2.sh on deinstallation.
