Depending on how you would like to start sshd2(8) you have two choices:
1) Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf.local:

sshd2_enable="YES"

For further available configuration variables when using this method see
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2{,.sh}.

2) Add the following entries to your /etc/inetd.conf:

ssh stream tcp  nowait root %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshd2 sshd -i
ssh stream tcp6 nowait root %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshd2 sshd -i

Using this method requires to manually generate a host key by either
executing `%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshd2{,.sh} keygen` or by issuing
ssh-keygen2(1) directly.
