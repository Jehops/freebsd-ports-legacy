md5deep is a cross-platform set of programs to compute 
MD5 message digests or SHA-1 message digests on an arbitrary
number of files. The programs run on Windows, Linux, *BSD, 
OS X, Solaris, and should run on most other platforms.
md5deep is similar to the md5sum program found in the 
GNU Coreutils package, but has many additional features.
