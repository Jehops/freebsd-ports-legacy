A web frontend for the pf firewall written in PHP.

What works?

    o Editing of macro, address translation, scrub, tables and
      filter rules. See the screenshots to see which options has been
      implemented.
    o Queues - works as of version 0.5.
    o Importing your current rulebase. And please backup your current
      /etc/pf.conf before you install pfw.
    o Installing the rulebase. This is not just a rulebase generator,
      it will read and write to and from your /etc/pf.conf file and
      reload pf through pfctl.
    o pfw makes an effort to preserving configurations currently
      not supported.

What doesn't work yet?

    o Advanced filter options like dup-to & fastroute.
    o Specifications using negated hosts, nets,... like !www.freebsd.org.
