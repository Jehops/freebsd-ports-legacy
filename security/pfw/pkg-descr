A web frontend for the pf firewall written in PHP.

Features

With the exceptions listed below, everything that can be done with
pf can be done through pfw. This includes:

    o Editing of all pf rules types like macros, address translation,
      queues, scrub, tables and filter rules.
    o Importing your current rulebase. Please backup your current
      /etc/pf.conf before installing pfw.
    o Installing the rulebase. This is not just a rulebase generator,
      it will read and write to and from your /etc/pf.conf file and
      reload pf through pfctl.
    o Standard based xhtml 1.1 and CSS 2.0 compliant code with
      separate print style sheet that will print your ruleset nicely.
