	ATTENTION:

1) Create database to store configurations:
sqlite %%PFW_PREFIX%%/conf/config.db < %%DATADIR%%/sqlite.sql

3) pfw needs Apache to run in non-chrooted mode (otherwise, we can't
access /etc/pf.conf).

3) pfw relies on sudo to perform privileged operations and sudo needs to
be configured for this. You need to add a line like this: 

www ALL = NOPASSWD: %%PFW_PREFIX%%/bin/*

to your %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sudoers file (edit with visudo).
Feel free to verify the scripts in the bin directory to see that they
don't do anything nasty before doing this :-)

4) There is currently no builtin authentication in pfw so please read
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/auth.html and add authentication
accordingly.

5) Add the following line to your httpd.conf:

Alias /pfw/ "%%PFW_PREFIX%%/web/"
<Directory "%%PFW_PREFIX%%/web">
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
</Directory>

Restart apache and access pfw as http://localhost/pfw/

That's it. Pfw is now installed and ready to be used.

Enjoy!
