	ATTENTION:

1) pfw needs Apache to run in non-chrooted mode (otherwise, we can't
access /etc/pf.conf).

2) pfw relies on sudo to perform privileged operations and sudo needs to
be configured for this. You need to add a line like this: 
www ALL = NOPASSWD: %%PFW_PREFIX%%/bin/*
to your %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sudoers file (edit with visudo).
Feel free to verify the scripts in the bin directory to see that they
don't do anything nasty before doing this :-)

3) There is currently no builtin authentication in pfw so please read
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/auth.html and add authentication
accordingly.

4) Add the following line to your httpd.conf:

Alias /pfw/ "%%PFW_PREFIX%%/web/"

Restart apache and access pfw as http://localhost/pfw/

5) If you want to use pfw to update a remote pfw, please read the
documentation in %%PFW_PREFIX%%/bin/pfwctlwrapper.sh.remote.

That's it. Pfw is now installed and ready to be used.

Enjoy!
