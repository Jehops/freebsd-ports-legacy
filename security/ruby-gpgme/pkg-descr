Ruby-GPGME is a ruby interface to GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME).

- Provides three levels of API.

- The low-level API allows direct access to about 94% of C functions
  provided by GPGME.

- The mid-level API looks object-oriented (or rubyish).

- The high-level API provides a convenient class-based interface to
  frequently used GPGME functions.
