In order to use pulled pork, adjust the config files located in
%%CONFIGDIR%%/


Important Note:

Snort change the way rules are published. In June 2010 Snort will
stop offering rules in the "snortrules-snapshot-CURRENT" format.

Instead, rules will be released for specific Snort versions.
You will be responsible for downloading the correct rules release
for your version of Snort.

The new versioning mechanism will require a four digit version in the
file name. To get the new download naming schema visit snort.org,
and look at 'My Account' -> 'Subscriptions and Oinkcodes'

BE SURE to read through the master pulledpork.conf file thoroughly,
as there are many changes as of snort 2.8.6.0 that WILL affect you,
even if you are NOT yet running 2.8.6.0!
