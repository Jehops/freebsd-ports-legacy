Smtpmap is able to identify the running smtp software on a given host.
It shows the probability of the server version, and uses three
different fingerprinting technologies to maximize the probabilities.
It can also be used to look if there is any smtp service running on
the given port.

Smtpmap is a program from Dennis Lubert <plasmahh@gmx.net>.
