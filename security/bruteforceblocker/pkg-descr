BruteForceBlocker is a script, that works along with pf - OpenBSD's firewall.
When this script is running, it checks sshd's auth log for Failed Password
attempts and counts it's number. When given IP reaches specified number of
fails, script adds this IP to the pf's table and block any other traffic to
the given box. If you are bored of those automated auth tries, you will be
happy with this script. It also includes a simple rc script.
