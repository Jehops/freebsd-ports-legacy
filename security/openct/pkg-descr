OpenCT, a middleware framework for smart card terminals.
It all started with a reader driver library to provide a framework for people
writing drivers for smart card readers. The idea was to provide all the usual
stuff (T=0, T=1, serial vs. USB device handling, etc) in a single place, and
reduce driver writing to interaction with the device itself.

OpenCT provides a native OpenCT, CT-API and PC/SC Lite IFD interface with an
OpenCT ifdhandler resource manager.

OpenCT is an open source implementation providing card terminal drivers:
Towitoko CHIPDRIVE micro - serial interface reader
KOBIL KAAN Professional - serial interface reader
Schlumberger e-gate - USB token / smart card reader
Aladdin eToken PRO - USB crypto Token
Eutron CryptoIdentity IT-SEC - A USB crypto Token
