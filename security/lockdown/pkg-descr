Lockdown is a hardening system written in C++ for FreeBSD
and released under the BSD license.

Lockdown was designed to harden FreeBSD's base system. It does
so by editing the systems configuration files and set
permissions, flags and ownership on SUID, GID and "information"
files.  Lockdown was meant to be run only once (after a system
install or upgrade), so you can quickly and without forgetting
something, get a secure system.
