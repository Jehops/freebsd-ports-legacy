Lockdown is a hardening system written in C++ for FreeBSD
and released under the BSD license.

Lockdown was designed to harden FreeBSD's base system. It does so
by editing the systems configuration files and set permissions,
flags and ownership on SUID, GID and information files.
Lockdown was meant to be run only once, so you can quickly
and without forgetting something, get a secure system running.
