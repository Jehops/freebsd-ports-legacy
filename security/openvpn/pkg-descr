OpenVPN is a robust and highly configurable VPN (Virtual Private
Network) daemon which can be used to securely link two or more private
networks using an encrypted tunnel over the internet. It uses UDP as its
transport, avoiding TCP-over-TCP retransmission congestion. SSL can be
used to authenticate the sites, or they can use a pre-shared secret.
