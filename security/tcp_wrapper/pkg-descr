This is the 6.3 version of the TCP/IP daemon wrapper package.

With this package you can monitor and filter incoming requests for the
SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, RSH, EXEC, TFTP, TALK, and other
network services.

The package provides tiny daemon wrapper programs that can be installed
without any changes to existing software or to existing configuration
files.  The wrappers report the name of the remote host and of the
requested service; the wrappers do not exchange information with the
remote client process, and impose no overhead on the actual
communication between the client and server applications.

Optional features are: access control to restrict what systems can
connect to your network daemons; remote user name lookups with the RFC
931 protocol; additional protection against hosts that pretend to have
someone elses host name; additional protection against hosts that
pretend to have someone elses host address.
