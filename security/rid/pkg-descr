RID - Remote Intrusion Detection
--------------------------------
RID is a configurable tool which uses intrusion fingerprints to track down
compromised hosts.  RID can remotely detect Stacheldraht, TFN, Trinoo and TFN2k
if the attacker did not change the default ports.

After a compromise, this information can often be turned into a "fingerprint"
of the intrusion.  RID is designed to be capable of accurately specifying this
"fingerprint" with little knowledge of network programming.

RID is based off an extension of ngrep (network grep).  It is different because
it extends ngrep into a probing tool.
