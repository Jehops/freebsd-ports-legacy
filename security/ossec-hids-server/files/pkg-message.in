After installation, you need to edit the ossec.conf file to reflect the correct settings
for your environment.  All the files related to %%PORTNAME%% have been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%PORTNAME%% and its subdirectories.

For information on proper configuration, see http://www.ossec.net/.

To enable the startup script, add ossechids_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.
To enable database output, execute:

%%PREFIX%%/%%PORTNAME%%/bin/ossec-control enable database

Then check this tutorial:

When you deinstall this port after starting the daemons once, many directories that are
created by the daemons will remain.  To fully remove the port you need to delete those
directories manually.
