GNU POC is a program for managing passwords on smartcards

Each password is stored together with a description on the card. 
All data on the card is stored encrypted so others won't be able to 
get your passwords by reading the card. 

POC encrypts using Blowfish or Rijndael (AES) with a 192 or 256 bit key 
(depending on the security level selected by the user). 
Other algorithms can be added easily

POC needs a CT-API library. I use the one by Carlos Prados
