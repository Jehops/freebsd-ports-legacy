Please do not edit the fail2ban.conf, jail.conf, or any other 
files in the distributen as they will be overwritten upon each 
upgrade of the port. Instead, create new files named *.local e.g. 
fail2ban.local or jail.local.

For more information, see the official manual:
http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Configuration

If you have custom filters or actions and you are upgrading from
0.9.x please check them.

Users of pf: please note that instead of 
action = pf
you hae to write someting like
action = pf[port={80 443}, name=http]
