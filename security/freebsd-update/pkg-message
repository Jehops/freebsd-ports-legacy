Before you can use this, you will have to create an update configuration
file specifying the server to fetch updates from and the trusted public
key fingerprint.

Assuming you haven't changed ${PREFIX}, a sample configuration file is
installed in /usr/local/freebsd-update/update.conf.sample which will
fetch updates built by the author.  If you trust the author to securely
build binary updates for you to blindly install on this machine, copy
that file to /usr/local/freebsd-update/update.conf -- otherwise, create
/usr/local/freebsd-update/update.conf as appropriate.
