Before you can use this, you will have to create an update configuration
file specifying the server to fetch updates from and the trusted public
key fingerprint.

A sample configuration file has been installed in

       %%PREFIX%%/etc/freebsd-update.conf.sample

which will fetch updates built by the author.  If you trust the author
to securely build binary updates for you to blindly install on this
machine, copy that file to

       %%PREFIX%%/etc/freebsd-update.conf

otherwise, create that file as appropriate.
