***************************************************************************

This is a port of the virus signature files for F-Prot Antivirus.
You will need to install the port security/f-prot to make use of them.

The port disables verifying the checksum of the distfiles due to their 
frequency of change. If you wish to verify the files yourself you may use
the PGP signature files that have been installed in:

%%PREFIX%%/f-prot/

The F-RISK public PGP key is located at:

http://www.f-prot.com/company/KEY.ASC

NOTE: The script check-updates.pl is all ready included with the f-prot 
port and can be used as a secondary means of updating virus signature files.
