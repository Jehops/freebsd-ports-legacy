***************************************************************************

This is a port of the virus signature files for F-Prot Antivirus.
You will need to install the port security/f-prot to make use of them.

The port disables verifying the checksum of the distfiles due to
their frequency of change. If you wish to verify the files yourself
you may use the PGP signature files that have been installed in:

%%PREFIX%%/f-prot/

The FRISK public PGP key is located at:

http://www.f-prot.com/company/KEY.ASC

NOTE: The script check-updates.pl is already included with the
f-prot port port and can be used as a secondary means of updating
virus signature files.
