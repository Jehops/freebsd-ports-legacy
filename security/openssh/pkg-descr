Secure Shell is a set of programs for logging into a remote machine and for
executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin,
rsh, rcp, etc. and provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
