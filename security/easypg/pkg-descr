EasyPG is an all-in-one GnuPG interface for Emacs. It consists of two
parts: EasyPG Assistant and EasyPG Library.

EasyPG Assistant is a set of convenient tools to use GnuPG from
Emacs. EasyPG Library is a sort of an elisp port of GPGME, a wrapper
library which provides API to access some of the GnuPG functions.
