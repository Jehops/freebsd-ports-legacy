Audit is a client/server system that allows remote system logs auditing and
centralizing. It supports standard and modular syslog output formats
(non-standard logs can be easily supported due to its modular design). The
server (auditd) runs on audited machines and the client (audit) runs on the
auditors workstations. Multiple auditors are supported and managed by one or
more 'chief' auditors. Auditors can be configured in a way that each of them
can examine specific sets of logs.
