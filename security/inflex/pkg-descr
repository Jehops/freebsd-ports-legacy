Inflex is an inline virus scanner for sendmail mail servers (a port for
exim use also exists) which utilises an external virus scanner to scan all
inbound and outbound e-mail and attachments for viruses, and stop them
before they reach the recipients. 

Inflex notifies both the sender and the receiver that the mail is infected
and has been halted.

Inflex does not impose much overhead and has been tested and is in use on
major corporate networks with large amounts of mail traffic.
