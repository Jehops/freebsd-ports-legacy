from the README:

Oidentd is an ident (RFC 1413-compliant) daemon which runs on
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.  Oidentd supports most features of
pidentd as well as a number of features absent in pidentd.  Most
notably, oidentd allows users, given the proper permission, to
specify the identd response that the server will output when a
successful lookup is completed.  Oidentd also allows for pseudo-random
strings (either a prefix, such as "user," followed by a number
between 0 and 99999, or 10 pseudo-random characters of the set
0-9A-Za-z) to be returned upon the completion of a successful lookup
instead of a username or a UID.  Oidentd supports IP masqueraded
connections and supports fowarding ident requests for IP masqeraded
connections to the machines from which the connections originate.
For information on how to setup support for masqueraded connections,
see the "INSTALL" file. NOTE: Currently, only Linux supports the
-P -f and -m options.  In other words, the IP masquerading support
only exists on Linux right now.
