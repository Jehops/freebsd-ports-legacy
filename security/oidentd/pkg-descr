from the README:

Oidentd is an RFC 1413-compliant ident daemon which runs on
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.  Oidentd supports most features of
pidentd as well as a number of features absent in pidentd.  Most
notably, oidentd allows users, given the proper permission, to
specify the identd response that the server will output when a
successful lookup is completed.  Oidentd also allows for pseudo-random
strings (either a prefix, such as "user," followed by a number
between 0 and 99999, or 10 pseudo-random characters of the set
0-9A-Za-z) to be returned upon the completion of a successful lookup
instead of a username or a UID.  The IP masquerading support only
exists on Linux right now.

FreeBSD's inetd has a built-in ident service which can also generate
bogus responses.
