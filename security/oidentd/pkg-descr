from the README:

oidentd is an ident (rfc1413 compliant) daemon that runs on Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.  oidentd can handle IP masqueraded/NAT connections
on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.  oidentd has a flexible mechanism for specifying
ident responses.  Users can be granted permission to specify their own ident
responses.  Responses can be specified according to host and port pairs.

FreeBSD's inetd has a built-in ident service which can also generate
bogus responses.

Porter's note: Masquerading only works with ipf at the moment. Hopefully ipfw
will be supported in a later version of oidentd.
