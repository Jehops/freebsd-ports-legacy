The IntelR 82802 Firmware Hub (FWH) discrete component is compatible
with several Intel chipset platforms and a variety of applications.  The
device operates under the LPC/FWH interface/protocol.  The hardware
features of this device include a Random Number Generator (RNG), five
General-Purpose Inputs (GPIs), register-based block locking, and
hardware-based locking.

This port is a driver for the Intel 82802, implemented as kernel
loadable module.  The driver currently supports reading directly via
/dev/rng, or indirectly via kern_random (/dev/random).
