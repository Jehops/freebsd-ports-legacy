OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN, which is
supported by IOS 12.4(9)T or later on Cisco SR500, 870, 880,
1800, 2800, 3800, 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 Routers.

Like vpnc, OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or
associated in any way with, Cisco Systems. It just happens to
interoperate with their equipment.
