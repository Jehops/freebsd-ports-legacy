This is a snapshot version of Clam Antivirus. Clam Antivirus
is a command line virus scanner written entirely in C its 
database is kept up to date. It also detects polymorphic
viruses, scans compressed files and is supported by AMaViS.
On FreeBSD 4.X the milter interface isn't built by default because
it needs gcc30 or higher.
