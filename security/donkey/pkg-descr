<What's Donkey?>

Donkey is an alternative for S/KEY's "key" command. The new feature that
the original key doesn't have is print an entry for skeykeys as
follows;

This means that donkey is also an alternative for "keyinit". Since the
entry is printed to stdout (not to /etc/skeykeys), you can easily send
it to remote operator by e-mail (with PGP signature or something). So,
it is possible to initiate S/KEY without logging in from the console of the
host.

The name "Donkey" is an acronym of "Don't Key".

<How to use Donkey>

(1) Calculate a One-Time-Password.

Execute Donkey with sequence and seed, then input your passphrase.

The -f option allows you to choose hash function from MD2, MD4, and MD5.

The default hash function is MD4 due to the historical reason.

(2) Calculate multiple One-Time-Passwords at once.

Use -n option.

Note that although "Enter passphrase" is printed out to stderr,
One-Time-Passwords go to stdout. So, you can redirect the output
safely.

(3) Print skeykeys entry.

Use -i option without argments. Then, enter login name, sequence and
seed. If you like default value, just type RET. Input your passphrase
twice to get the entry.
