Prelude is a new innovative hybrid Intrusion Detection system designed 
to be very modular, distributed, rock solid and fast. 

The manager is the central logging point. It receives alerts from 
sensors and logs them using one or several plugins (the default logging 
being to a text file, but logging to a database is also possible - and 
recommended).
