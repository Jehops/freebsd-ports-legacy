If you had existing config files in %%PREFIX%%/etc/%%SGUILDIR%%
they were not overwritten.  If this is a first time install, you
must copy the sample files to the corresponding conf file and 
edit the various config files for your site.  See the INSTALL
doc in %%DOCSDIR%% for details.

The sql scripts for creating database tables were placed in
the %%PREFIX%%/share/%%SGUILDIR%%/ directory.  PLEASE 
NOTE: LOG_DIR is not set by this install.  You MUST create the 
correct LOG_DIRS and put a copy of the snort rules you use in 
LOG_DIR/rules.

The sguild, archive_sguildb.tcl and incident_report.tcl scripts
were placed in %%PREFIX%%/bin/.  The incident_report.tcl
script is from the contrib section.  There is no documentation
and the script's variables must be edited before it is used.

A startup script, named sguild.sh was installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/.  To enable it, edit /etc/rc.conf
per the instructions in the script.
