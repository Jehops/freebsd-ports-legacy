PLEASE NOTE: If you are upgrading from a previous version,
read the UPGRADE doc (in %%DOCSDIR%%) before proceeding!!!
Some noteworthy changes in version 0.7.0:
SSL is now required for server, sensor and client.
The sguild.conf and sguild.email files have changed.
You MUST run the upgrade_0.7.tcl script to clean up and
prepare the database before running the new version.  BE SURE
TO BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE PROCEEDING!!!

If you had existing config files in %%PREFIX%%/etc/%%SGUILDIR%%
they were not overwritten.  If this is a first time install, you
must copy the sample files to the corresponding conf file and 
edit the various config files for your site.  See the INSTALL
doc in %%DOCSDIR%% for details.  If this is an upgrade, replace
your existing conf file with the new one and edit accordingly.

The sql scripts for creating database tables were placed in
the %%PREFIX%%/share/%%SGUILDIR%%/ directory.  PLEASE 
NOTE: LOG_DIR is not set by this install.  You MUST create the 
correct LOG_DIRS and put a copy of the snort rules you use in 
LOG_DIR/rules.

The sguild, archive_sguildb.tcl and incident_report.tcl scripts
were placed in %%PREFIX%%/bin/.  The incident_report.tcl
script is from the contrib section.  There is no documentation
and the script's variables must be edited before it is used.

A startup script, named sguild.sh was installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/.  To enable it, edit /etc/rc.conf
per the instructions in the script.

NOTE:  Sguild now runs under the sguil user account not root!
