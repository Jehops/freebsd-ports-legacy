Sguil is an open source tool to implement Network 
Security Monitoring (NSM).  NSM is the collection, 
analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings 
to detect and respond to intrusions.  NSM tools are 
used more for network audit and specialized 
applications than traditional alert-centric "intrusion 
detection" systems.

Want to learn more about Network Security Monitoring 
(NSM)? Then check out Richard Bejtlich's recently 
released book, The Tao of Network Security Monitoring: 
Beyond Intrusion Detection. An excerpt reads:

"Network security monitoring (NSM) equips security 
staff to deal with the inevitable consequences of too 
few resources and too many responsibilities. NSM collects 
the data needed to generate better assessment, detection, 
and response processes--resulting in decreased impact from 
unauthorized activities."
