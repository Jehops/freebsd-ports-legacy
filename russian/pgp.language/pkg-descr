Russian language module for PGP
Currently, two charsets handled by PGP, it is koi8-r and alternate codes.
Internal representation of text files is koi8-r with CR/LF.
If you transfer text file out of your local system, don't
forget to add -t (text) option to 'pgp' call.
Without it, your text can't be read if local and remote system
charsets are different, f.e. Unix<-->MSDOS transfer.
