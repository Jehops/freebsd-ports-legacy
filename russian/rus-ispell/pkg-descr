New Russian dictionaries for ispell

This package contains a list of Russian words and an affix file to be
used with a well-known ispell spelling checker.  It may be especially
useful for UNIX users.

The word list is based on the early one collected by Neal Dalton.
After removing illegal words and adding many new rules and words, the
dictionaries contain now over 90,100 basic words and produce over
892,000 related words (compared to 52,000 words in Neal's version).

This package seems to be the only one that supports the right spelling
of words with the Russian letter 'yo' (other dictionaries simply
replace the letter 'yo' by 'ye').

Further detailed documentation on the package is in Russian (koi8-r
character set) in README.koi file.
