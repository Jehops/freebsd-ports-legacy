Xxkb is a simple XKB keyboard mapping switcher. It maintains
the active keyboard mapping on a per-window basis. An optional
small icon is added to each window to indicate the current 
keyboard mapping for that window. In addition to using a key 
combination specified in XKB configuration you can also
click on this icon to switch between mappings.

Xxkb works with basically any window manager.
