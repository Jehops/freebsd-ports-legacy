This C library allows to convert cyrillic text from any to any of the following
cyrillic charsets: windows-1251, koi8-r, koi8-u, iso-8859-5, x-mac-cyrillic and
ibm866. Automatic detection of charset is possible for any of those.

The library also contains a number of automation features and useful service
wrappers that are ready to be easily plugged into any application whenever one
needs more wise features instead of just dumb converting.
