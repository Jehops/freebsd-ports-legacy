The  purpose  of the game is to avoid being killed by enemies. Enemies are 
the two fuses runing on the  boundary, and the qix moving inside the
territory. You can leave the boundary and draw a line inside  the territory;
then you return on the boundary, filling a rectangle. Once you have filled an
area greater than 75% of the whole surface you reach the next level.
