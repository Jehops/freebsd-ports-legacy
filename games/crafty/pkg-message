This package is set to allow per-user config files, and a shared books
directory.  To accomplish this, crafty is setgid nobody, and the books
and learning information are owned by the user 'nobody.'

The location values are tunable, see message when make is issued.

		** IMPORTANT **

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING TO THIS VERSION, YOU WILL NEED TO DE-INSTALL ANY
OPENING BOOKS YOU HAVE AS THE FORMATS HAVE CHANGED.  SIMPLY UNINSTALL
AND REBUILD FROM THE PORT (NOT PACKAGE) AND THEY'LL BE REBUILT BY THE
ENGINE IN THE NEW FORMAT.

If you have an SMP system, add a line to your ~/.craftyrc file to the
effect:

smpmt=2 (or however many cpus you have)

Do not set this higher than you really have, or performance will
actually drop.
