Cube is a 3D First Person Shooter that uses OpenGL and SDL.

Features:
- Single-player and Multiplayer gameplay.
- Allows in-engine editing of geometry in full 3D (you fly around the map,
  point / drag stuff to select it / modify it), which can even be done with
  multiple people at once (a first!).
- Has simplistic but effective fine grain vertex lighting that looks like
  lightmapping and can do dynamic lights & shadows.
- Doesn't need any kind of map precompilation, even lighting is done on the
  fly.
- Has very simplistic quad-tree world structure that can do slopes
  (heightfields with caps) and slants, water.
- Does decent collision detection & physics.
- Has client/server networking that goes a long way in giving a lag-free game
  experience.
- Features a Doom/Quake-style singleplayer and multiplayer game with some
  uncompromising brutal oldskool gameplay.
