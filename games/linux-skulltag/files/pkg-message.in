Nearly done!

To be able to work, skulltag needs an official Doom, Doom 2, Heretic
etc WAD file. This file comes with the official distribution of
these games. You can still buy these games via the Internet for
cheap, so use that instead of illegal downloading.

Once you have obtained it, please place it in
%%PREFIX%%/share/games/skulltag and run the game.

Note: If the sound doesn't work, go to Options -> Sound Options ->
Select SDL for the Output System and restart the game.
