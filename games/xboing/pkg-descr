Description
-----------

XBoing is a blockout type game where you have a paddle which you use to
bounce a ball around the game area blowing up blocks with the ball. You win by
obtaining points for each block destroyed and each level completed. The person
with the highest score wins.

XBoing was started like many other projects to learn Xlib better. I had the 
XPM library and was already using it in a Motif application. I thought that it
would be cool to have nice colour pictures/animations in an Xlib game. So I 
did. Without the XPM library I would be still playing with the colours I think.

Please read the manual page as the manual has some important game play 
information. 

WARNING: This game requires a lot of grunt to run well. If someone is doing
         a compile or the load is large then expect the game to be a bit
         bumpy and hard to play. Sorry about that. ;-|
