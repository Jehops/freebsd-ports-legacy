EDuke32 is a Windows/Linux/UNIX version of Duke Nukem 3D aimed at highly
extending what can be edited in the game. EDuke32 combines the work that JonoF
and Ken Silverman have put in to JFDuke3D with the original EDuke work done by
Matt Saettler, while simultaneously adding tons of new and useful features.
Consequently, EDuke32 is the most advanced version of Duke Nukem 3D in
existence. EDuke32 is developed and maintained by Richard "TerminX" Gobeille
and the EDuke32 team.

This port includes icculus.org/duke3d patches for sound and joystick support.
