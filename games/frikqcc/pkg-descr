FrikQCC was started a few months before the Quake engine source was
released.  Originally based off of FastQCC, it was widely (well among
the people at MDQNet) enjoyed for a few months.  Then J. P. Grossman
released QCCX, back in March 2000.  QCCX implemented a ton of neato-
whizbang features that I just had to have.  I immediately set out to
add some of the better stuff from FrikQCC 1.x, such as warnings and
some of my own ideas of optimizations to his code.  The result was
FrikQCC 2.0, which has been updated many times since then.  I've
started moving away from some of the old QCCX features (for example my
Arrays are different, as is the new int type) in an effort to make the
code more user friendly.
