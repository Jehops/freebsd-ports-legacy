This is a curses version of Yahtzee, that classic dice game. 

Unfortunately this game does not come with any documentation. One day,
I might find a few moments to write up a man page to solve this little
problem. But until then you'll have to use magic to find your own way
around. 

Share and enjoy,

Joel...
