The Free Standard Game Server (FSGS) is the core part of the Net-Games
gaming network technology, available for Windows, MacOS, Linux and FreeBSD.
It enables you to build your own gaming network, either on the internet or
in a local area network. It gives you rankings, ladders, built in chat and
user management functions.
