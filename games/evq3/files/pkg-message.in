Evolution Q3 has been installed.

The program does not support loading QVM files in your architecture, so to
play it you have to copy the files "game.so", "cgame.so" and "ui.so" installed
by the "games/quake3" or "games/ioquake3" port from
"%%PREFIX%%/lib/${PORTNAME}/baseq3" to "%%LIBDIR%%/baseq3".
