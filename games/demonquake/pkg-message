To start it in full-screen mode you can run it with the "-fullscreen"
parameter.

If you have mouse problems you can try running it with the "-nomdga"
parameter (this will make the mouse work fine when the DGA X11 extension is
disabled).

If you hace sound problems try running it with the parameter
"-sndspeed <speed>", where "<speed>" could be 22050 or 44100 for example.

The console history file is disabled by default, to enable it set the variable
"cmdhist_file" to "1".
