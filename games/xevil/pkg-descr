XEvil is a side-view, single or network-multiplayer, fast-action,
kill-everything, game for Windows and UNIX.

You have sinned in life.  Now, you die and go to Hell.  XEvil is the
contest that determines your fate in Hell for all eternity.  At the
end of a game, you receive one of many possible rankings.  A poor
player, for example, may spend the rest of time as "Satan's Earwax
Remover", while a good one might achieve a prestigious title such as
"VP of Hell Marketing" or even "Lead Software Engineer of Hell".
