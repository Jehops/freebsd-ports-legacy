OpenArena is an open-source content package for Quake III Arena licensed under
the GPL, effectively creating a free stand-alone game. You do not need Quake
III Arena to play this game.

Bots were added starting in 0.6.0. They will spout taunts and everything!

Concepts would be loose, so don't expect a remake of Klesk in his original
Klesk form, or any direct remakes of any map/weapon/model.
