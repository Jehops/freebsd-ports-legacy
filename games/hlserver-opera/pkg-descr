[from developer's site]
Ever watch a Hong Kong Blood Opera (HKBO) movie? This is one film
genre which really takes action fans to the next level: the violence
is stylised, carefully choreographed... it's cool.

The Opera isn't about blowing a body into a thousand pieces; it
isn't about being impersonal as you send a bullet into someone's
head from 800 meters away.

What The Opera IS about is John Woo-style gunfights - a recreation
of an HKBO movie. Not a fragfest: a duel. Learning how to live with
getting killed by a rocket launcher is easy. How about when your
opponent double-taps you in the head with dual Berettas while diving
backwards down a stairway?

Choose your weapons. Choose your Discipline. Choose your character.
In a world of assassins, death is inevitable. Go out in style.
