iMaze is a multi-player network action game for TCP/IP with 3D graphics
under X11 (XView or Motif). You run through a labyrinth and shoot everything
that is round without being hit by other round anythings.

Of course anything round is one of the following:

 * other players playing over the net
 * computer controlled ninjas
 * deadly shots (except your own)

Features:

 * sophisticated, reliable network protocol, works even with SLIP connections
   via modem
 * windows can be freely scaled to avoid speed drawbacks due to poor display
   performance
 * modular, portable source code
 * scores
 * sound and joystick support
