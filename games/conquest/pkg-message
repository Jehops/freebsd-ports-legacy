Before Conquest can be run it must be configured. First copy the sample
configuration into place:

# cp etc/conquest/conqrule.sample etc/conquest/conqrule

Then you can initialise and enable the game:

# sbin/conqoper -C
# sbin/conqoper -Ie -E

Conqoper is documented in share/doc/conquest/README.

Also a file for the in-game news must be created. This package includes a
sample news file you can copy into place:

# cp share/conquest/conqnews.doc.sample share/conquest/conqnews.doc
