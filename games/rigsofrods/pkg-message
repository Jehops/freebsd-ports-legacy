==========================================================================

Note that RoR was built without CgProgramManager ogre3d plugin
(which is not avialable for FreeBSD because it depends on proprietary
NVidia CG Toolkit), which means that some visual effects will either
not work or will prevent game from running. You can always run
rorconfig and disable them.

Also note that there's some sound problems still unresolved.

Don't forget to run rorconfig before running the game.
