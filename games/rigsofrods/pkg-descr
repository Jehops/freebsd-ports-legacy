Rigs of Rods (also known as RoR), is a truck, car, airplane and
boat simulator. You can drive, fly or sail in total freedom in an
open environment. What makes RoR different to most simulators is
its unique soft-body physics: vehicles chassis and wheels are
simulated in real-time as flexible objects, giving the simulation
an extremely accurate behavior, while allowing the vehicles to be
simply specified by their structural composition, as a network of
interconnected nodes (forming the chassis and the wheels). Crashing
into walls or terrain can permanently deform a vehicle in a realistic
manner. In addition to its unique soft-body physics, RoR also
features an advanced flight model based on blade element theory,
allowing the accurate simulation of any airplane, base on their
physical dimensions and wing airfoils. It also features an accurate
buoyancy model based on elemental pressure gradients, enabling boats
with complex hulls to move realistically in the swell.
