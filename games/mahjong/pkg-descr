This is a set of three programs which provide a networked Mah Jong
program, together with a computer player. Thus the game can be played
by four humans, by a human and three computer players, or any other
combination. There is a server program, which handles the game - only
one game, since I'm not trying to compete with Yahoo! and friends -,
an X client to allow humans to play naturally, and a computer player.
The version of Mah Jong is that generally called Chinese Classical.
Of course, there are many variants within this; I intend to
accommodate most of the more interesting variants via options, but
this is future work. In the longer term, I might also be interested
in adding Hong Kong and Japanese versions. I'm not interested in
adding American versions, though somebody else might be.
