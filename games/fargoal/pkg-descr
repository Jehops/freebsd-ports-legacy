This game is a remake of the classic roguelike game "Sword of
Fargoal", created by Jeff McCord for the Commodore 64 in 1983.
This remake was written for the 2003 remakes.org competition.

Note: this port installs both the Sword of Fargoal executable,
'sword', and a wrapper script, 'fargoal', which allows each
user to keep their own savefiles in their ~/.fargoal directory.
