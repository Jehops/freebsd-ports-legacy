There is a bug in Q3 server regarding server log placement.
Temporary workaround for this problem is to run Q3 server in
a non-root environment. You may create a separate account for
this or use an existing one as long as it does not have super-
user privileges and manually do a recursive change in ownership
to Q3 server and any mods you install accordingly.
