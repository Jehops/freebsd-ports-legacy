==============================================================================

The input devices are now handled by SDL. Some mouse buttons will have
different aliases and the mouse speed needs to be readjusted.

The configuration files are saved to ~/.ioquake3 instead of ~/.q3a because
they have additional variables which would be removed if other engines
overwrite them. But you can safely copy the original directory to the new one
for the first time.

Should you encounter freezes when playing a demo or single player game,
rebuild without client libraries.
