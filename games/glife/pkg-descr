An artificial life implementation using GNOME :)

It will try to emulate an Artificial Society.  It will implement
reproduction, and movement.  Movement will be based on the 'vision'
of the animals.  In the future there will also be terrain interaction
(consume food, and food 'reproduction rate') - this will also come along
with animal 'metabolism' rates.  After this is done, combat and
'culture' factors will be added - Maybe inheritance.

Among other things :) The aim is to keep everything HIGHLY configurable.
