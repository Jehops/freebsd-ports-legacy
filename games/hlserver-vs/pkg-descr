This package contains the files to run a FreeBSD Half-Life
Vampire Slayer server under Linux emulation.

[from developer's site]
Please note, this mod has nothing specifically to do with 'Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'(tm). When the game starts you choose a team,
Vampire or Slayer. The game is played in rounds where the teams
have to wipe out the opposition. More scenarios regarding round
objectives are planned. The game pits the speed and physical
dexterity of the Vampires against the weaponry of the Slayers.
Vampires can move quicker, jump higher, leap at opponents. Slayers
are mere mortals but use shotguns, machine guns and crossbows to
fight their enemy. Although Vampires have no ranged weapons, their
close up attack is deadly. Vampires can move quietly to get close
enough to use this attack. Vampires cannot be killed with bullets
alone. You must either stake them or use the "stake firing crossbow"
to properly kill a Vampire. If a Vampire is knocked down with
bullets and is not staked, the Vampire will rise again. Vampires
can feed off dead bodies to recover health.
