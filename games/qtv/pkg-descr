QTV is a QuakeWorld streaming proxy over TCP/IP.  Its main purpose is to
stream MVD data from the QuakeWorld servers using low bandwidth and keeping
playback smooth.  Pros also include low resource utilization regarding
memory and CPU time and the ability to support lots of observers without
stressing the QuakeWorld server(s) too much.
