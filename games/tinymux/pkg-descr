TinyMUX is a Multi-Player FreeForm adventure server.

Based on the popular TinyMUSH code (and PernMUSH) code,
TinyMUX allows a group of players to build their own adventure
style game.  As distributed, there is no pre-built database so
you might want to explore some of the many MUSHs that already
exists.
