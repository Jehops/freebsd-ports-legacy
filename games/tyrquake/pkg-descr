This is meant to be a very conservative branch of the Quake source code. I
intend to support Quake and Quakeworld in both software and GL versions, as
well as Quakeworld Server; all on both MS Windows and Linux. I don't intend on
adding lots of rendering enhancements, but rather fixing little bugs that I've
come across over the years. I'll be adding small enhancements, but I don't
want to completely overhaul the engine.
