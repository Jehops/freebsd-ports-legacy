The official Formula 1 website includes a Java client, which during races,
qualifying, and practice sessions, displays the Live Timing information from
the race track.

Live F1 is a native client for viewing the same Live Timing feed without the
need for a Java-enabled web browser. A user account on formula1.com is still
required.
