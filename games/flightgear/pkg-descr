FlightGear is a free, multi-platform civil aviation flight simulator
package.  It features detailed, texture-mapped scenery, keyboard and
joystick controls, a heads-up display, and optional realistic instrument
panel.  A 3-D accelerator card supported by Mesa is highly recommended (3DFX
Voodoo/Voodoo2 and nVIDIA Riva TNT are known to work.)
