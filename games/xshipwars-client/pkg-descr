ShipWars (aka XSW) development started in January 1998. its is now a
space oriented graphical MUD/game based on the charactures from Bajor3D.
It also now has its own stand-alone client/server, therefore it is no
longer MUCK dependant. Its currently being developed on Linux/X and as of
version .55 will compile on any UNIX system.
