The project is a collaboration focusing on development of the bnetd server.
This is a program that attempts to emulate Blizzard's Battle.net service.

A major part of the effort is supporting all Blizzard's Battle.net compatible
games. The server may eventually support some non-Blizzard clients as well,
but no work is currently being put into that. Certain software in addition to
the bnetd server should also be considered part of the bnetd project. This
includes BNS (BNetd Selector), bnchat (a text-based chat client), the BNI
utilities, and bntrackd (BNetd TRACKing Daemon). The bnetd team also produces
documentation about these programs and the Battle.net protocol.
