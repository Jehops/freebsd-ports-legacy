This is a Tcl/Tk (and supporting C lib) implementation of the
cardgame President (aka Ass).  You will play against three computer
players, each with a slightly different playing style (although
none of these styles are particularly advanced, yet).  Instructions on
how to play the cardgame are included for the unfamiliar.

As a package, this requires Tk80.  However, if you edit the port
Makefile and build it yourself it will automatically detect and
configure for any of Tk41, Tk42, Tk80, or the absence of all three
(in which case no GUI will be available).
