This is a Tcl/Tk (and supporting C lib) implementation of the
cardgame President (aka Ass).  You will play against three computer
players, each with a slightly different playing style (although
none of these styles are particularly advanced, yet).  Instructions on
how to play the cardgame are included for the unfamiliar.
