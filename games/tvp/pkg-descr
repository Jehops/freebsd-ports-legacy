This is an implementation of the cardgame President (aka Ass)
which is based on Tcl/Tk.  You will play against three computer
players, each of which has a slightly different playing style,
although the styles are not that advanced (yet).  An explanation
of how to play the game is included for the unfamiliar.

As a package, this requires Tk80.  However, if you edit the port
Makefile and build it yourself it will automatically detect and
configure for any of Tk41, Tk42, Tk80, or the absence of all three
(in which case no GUI will be available).
