XNibbles is a game for X11R6.  It is conceptually based on
the nibbles program that came with qbasic for MS-DOS and was
in turn very similar to the game RunRound found on some XTs.

Nibbles is actually written in C++, and shares no code
with qbasic nibbles.  For those of you who have played the
game before, you can attest to the fact that it is extremely
fun and addictive.

The goal of the game is to work your way through the levels,
which become harder and harder.  You do this by running
your snake over the blue diamonds.  For every 10 diamonds you
acquire, you move up one level.  Other diamonds will increase
your length, give you an extra life, or give you points.
