   XNibbles is a game for X11R6.  It is conceptually  based on 
nibbles, which was a program that came with qbasic for MS-DOS.

   XNibbles is  actually  written  in C++, and  shares no code 
with qbasic nibbles.  For  those of  you  who  have played the
game before, you  can  attest to the fact that it is extremely
fun and addictive.

   The  goal  of  the  game  is  to  work your way through the
levels, which become harder and harder. You do this by running
your snake over the  blue  diamonds. For every 10 diamonds you
acquire, you  move up  one  level.  Along the way, a number of
other diamonds will be encountered.  Gold doubles your length,
and  red  halves  your  length, both giving you points.  Green
gives you an extra life. You die if you run into yourself or a
wall. Question marks serve as warps.
