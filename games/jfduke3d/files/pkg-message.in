JonoF's Duke Nukem 3D Port has been successfully installed.

You still need the original Duke Nukem 3D data file. Please copy DUKE3D.GRP to
the %%DATADIR%% directory and run the fix.sh script inside that directory.

The JonoF Duke Nukem 3D Port supports the following Duke Nukem 3D versions:

* Duke3D Shareware
* Duke3D 1.3d
* Duke3D 1.4/5 Atomic

NOTE: Be sure to read the release notes in this distribution. There's important
information about using the new features in this release.

The release notes can be found in %%DOCSDIR%%.

If you have any problems with running this port please contact the maintainer
of this port and NOT Jonathan Fowler.

The following features are not usable at the moment:

* Sound doesn't work
* No joystick support
* GL mode doesn't work

NOTE: You can find patches which enable sound and add joystick support here:

http://jonof.edgenetwork.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3245

I was not able to compile the port with these patches. If you manage to do so
and the binary runs under FreeBSD with sound/jostick support enabled, please
drop me a note telling me how you did it. I'd really like to add those patches
to the port, because especially the lack of sound reduces the gameplay-fun a
lot.

NOTE: Additions to the retail version features of Duke Nukem 3D can be found on
the 3D Realms forum. These patches/hacks feature high/low resolution textures,
MD2/MD3 models, Blood and Gore hacks, map hacks, etc. The 3D Realms Forum can
be accessed through this URL:

Thx.
