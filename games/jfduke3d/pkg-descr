This is the Duke Nukem 3D Port written by Jonathan Fowler. Like any other Duke
Nukem 3D Port it is a hack of the original Duke Nukem 3D source code (v1.5 CD

The following Duke Nukem 3D versions are supported:
* Duke3D Shareware
* Duke3D 1.3d
* Duke3D 1.4/5 Atomic

Be sure to read the release notes in this distribution. There's important
information about using the new features in this release.

3D Realms forum. These patches/hacks feature high/low resolution textures,
MD2/MD3 models, Blood and Gore hacks, map hacks, etc. The 3D Realms Forum can
