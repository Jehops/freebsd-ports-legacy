[from developer's site]
The year is 2080, the government has been corrupted by the power
their technology has granted them. An underground rebellion force
has formed and is fighting back against this tremendous threat with
the same technology - a technology that has fuelled a war between
malevolent Artificial Intelligence and Humanity. Our existence is
at risk...

With open access to human brain waves, this new science is able to
amplify single human DNA strands, which contain the unique genetic
coding of every individual. Different attributes and knowledge of
any individual can be enhanced, or diminished. Both sides hold the
same technology, the ever growing AI can not co-exist with self
reliant spontaneous humanity. Obliteration of one is inevitable...
will you help fight for our race? Or have they gotten to you already?
