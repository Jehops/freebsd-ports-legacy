AA2K6 is the latest in a series of standalone games based on a classic Sci-Fi
theme with a modern, updated visual experience. With 25 levels, five modes of
play, mutators, built-in bots, 9 characters, 8 weapons (3 with alt-fire
modes), the game has an endless supply of replayability. Billed as the sequel
to 2004's CodeRED: Alien Arena, AA2K6 is much more than that. With the trials
and tribulations of software development, endless hours of playing, gathering
feedback, COR Entertainment has been able to not only fine tune and perfect
it's flagship game, but add completely new dimensions to it.

Note: this port only contains the data needed to run AA2K6, shared by the
Linux and native ports of the game engine. To play AA2K6 you have to install
one of "games/alienarena" or "games/linux-alienarena".
