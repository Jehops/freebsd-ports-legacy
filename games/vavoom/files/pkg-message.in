Vavoom has been installed.

The wrapper script is named "vavoom" and accepts a "-s" argument to run the
dedicated server instead of the client. It creates/enters ~/.vavoom (if it
does not exist creates symlinks) and runs the programs from there, looking for
additional IWAD files in %%DMDIR%%.

The real executables are in "%%PREFIX%%/libexec".
