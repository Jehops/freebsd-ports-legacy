==============================================================================

Vavoom has been installed.

The wrapper script is named "vavoom" and accepts a "-s" argument to run the
dedicated server instead of the client. It creates/enters ~/.vavoom (if it
does not exist creates symlinks) and runs the programs from there, looking for
additional IWAD files in "%%DMDIR%%".

The real executables (and utils) are in "%%PREFIX%%/libexec/vavoom".

If you enabled the EDITING option the VavoomC source code of the supported
games has been installed to "%%DATADIR%%/progs".

To run in OpenGL mode add the "-opengl" parameter, and "-openal" for OpenAL.

If you want to install enhaced textures, models or soundtracks use the
"games/vavoom-extras" port. Note that textures require OPENGL and soundtracks
need VORBIS (build options).

If you enabled LAUNCHER (build option), run "vlaunch" for a launcher GUI.
