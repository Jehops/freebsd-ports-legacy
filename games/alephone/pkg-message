Aleph One has been installed.

This package does not include any Aleph One data files. To obtain the original
ones use the "games/alephone-data" port. The "games/alephone-scenarios" port
contains more (unofficial) scenarios. In addition, you can search for data
files here:

Aleph One works best with OpenGL. If you do not have an OpenGL card and the
game is sluggish, try using the "-g" option to disable OpenGL.
