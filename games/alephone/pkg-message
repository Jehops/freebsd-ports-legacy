This package does not include any Aleph One data files.  There are a few
ways of getting a fully-playable version of Aleph One:

  * Install the `alephone-data' port.  This port includes the data files
    from Marathon Infinity.

  * Get a copy of Marathon 2 or Marathon Infinity and convert those data
    files into the appropriate AlephOne format (http://source.bungie.org
    has more information). You can get any of the Marathon series (and
    AlephOne conversions of Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity) from
    http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/.

  * Go to http://archives.bungie.org and download one or more of the SDL
    scenarios.

  * The games/marathon2-data port contains the AlephOne versions of the
    "Marathon 2: Durandal" data files.

AlephOne works best with OpenGL; if you do not have an OpenGL-savvy card
and the game is sluggish, try using the -g option to disable OpenGL.
