WARNING: editss will dump a core if it is not able to find a shipshapes file.

You  should  copy  the  editss rc  file  from  /usr/X11R6/share/editss/editssrc
to  $HOME/.editssrc  and   change  the  shiplib  keyword in  that  file to make
it point to your shipshapes file.

A nice shipshapes file can be found at ftp://ftp.xpilot.org/pub/shipshapes
