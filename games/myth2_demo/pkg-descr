    Sharpen your swords and fire up the cauldrons--Soulblighter is back!
 Bungie's thrilling strategy adventure, Myth II: Soulblighter, brings back the
 scourge of the West and challenges you with all-new scenarios and improved
 graphics and 3D rendering.
    In command of a ragtag army of berserkers, dwarves, soldiers and sorcerers,
 you are the last hope (yet again) of saving the folk of Madrigal and the West
 from the evil might of Soulblighter and his minions. Test your fortitiude by
 challenging others on your network or online to a battle to the death, or cross
 swords and sages with Soulblighter himself. For fantasy gamers, this is far
 better than a slab of roast beast washed down with a tall ale...

On FreeBSD it crashes after playing the introductory movie, if /dev/dsp is
available.
