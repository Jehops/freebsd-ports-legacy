QCCX is the world's first optimizing Quake-C compiler with support for string
manipulation, pointers, integers, arrays and ``for'' loops.  It is also the
fastest Quake-C compiler out there (to my knowledge).  QCCX is based on FastQCC
which was, in turn, based on QCCDOS.  Use it the same way you use any other
Quake-C compiler.
