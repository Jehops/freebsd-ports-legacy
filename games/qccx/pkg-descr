QCCX is the world's first optimizing Quake-C compiler with support for string
manipulation, pointers, integers, arrays, and ``for'' loops.  It is also the
fastest Quake-C compiler out there (at least at its time).  QCCX is based on
FastQCC which was, in turn, based on QCCDOS.  Use it the same way you use any
other Quake-C compiler.
