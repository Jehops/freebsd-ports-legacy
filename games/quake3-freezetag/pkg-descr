Freeze Tag is a teamplay modification for Quake3 and Team Arena. It is a lot
like that game you may have played as a kid, but without the killing. In
Freeze Tag you try to eliminate the entire enemy team. If you kill someone
then they will become frozen. So to eliminate all, you'd need to freeze
everyone, making them all frozen at the same time. This will give your team a
point and the round will start over again. If you are ever frozen, a teammate
can come rescue you by standing next to your icy body for three seconds.
You'll then be set free and can join the battle again.
