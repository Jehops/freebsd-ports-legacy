	Apparently, this game was originally written outside of Digital,
	probably at a university.  The game was ported to DEC's VAX/VMS
	from the TOPS-10/20 FORTRAN sources available around fall 1979.
	Ed James got hold of the sources at Berkeley and converted
	portions of the code to C, mostly to use curses for the screen
	handling.  He published his modified sources on the net in
	December 1986.  Because this game ran on VMS machines for so
        long, a previous version is known as VMS Empire.
