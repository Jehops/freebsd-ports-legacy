There is a bug in HLDS regarding the server log placement.
Temporary workaround for this little problem is to run HLDS in
a non-root environment. You may create a separate account for
this or use an existing one as long as it does not have super-
user privileges and manually do a recursive change in ownership
and permissions to HLDS and any mods you install accordingly.
