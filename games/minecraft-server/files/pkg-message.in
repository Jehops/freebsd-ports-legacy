When you first run minecraft-server, it will populate the file
%%ETCDIR%%/eula.txt

It is required to read the EULA, and then set eula=true

- Configuration files can be found at %%ETCDIR%%
- Log and debug output files can be found at /var/log/minecraft-server/
- World files can be found at /var/db/minecraft-server

Without daemon option:
- To run the server, run %%PREFIX%%/bin/minecraft-server
- To edit java's parameters, edit %%ETCDIR%%/java-args.txt

With daemon option:
- The service has been installed with the name 'minecraft'
- To adjust memory usage, use MINECRAFT_MEM= in /etc/rc.conf
- To add other java parameters, use MINECRAFT_ARGS= in /etc/rc.conf
- To see the interactive console, type service minecraft console

Users upgrading from version < 1.8 are advised to run the server to
generate new config files, and then modify them based on their existing
configuration, as most files are now JSON instead of txt.

Users upgrading from from 1.8 will need to re-accept the EULA. They
may also wish to delete %%DATADIR%% as it is 
no longer used.
