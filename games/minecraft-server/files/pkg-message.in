  add the following line to your /etc/rc.conf:

  %%PREFIX%%/share/minecraft-server

  Configuration can be done using the config-files
  or as OP using the Client. Config files are in

  If you have trouble starting or stopping the
  server try to delete an unclean server.log.lck:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/minecraft clean

  be deleted (do generate a new one next time
  the server starts) using:
  
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/minecraft killworld

  You can delete the server.log (so it's not
  getting to fat) using:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/minecraft clearlog
