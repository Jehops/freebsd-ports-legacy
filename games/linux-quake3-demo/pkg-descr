This is the Linux version the Quake III Arena demo 
from id Software / Loki Software

It features single and multi player gaming.

Note that the graphics performance is typically bound by your
OpenGL driver.

Tested with:
o FreeBSD5.0-CURRENT, AMD K7-700, GeForce DDR, XFree86 3.3.6, 
  Mesa 3.2.1, Utah glx 0.9 (the rather slow hw acc driver)
  results in 21.5 fps (640x480x16) for time demo 'demo001'.
  Sound worked fine (SB Live).

IMPORTANT:
Due to license restrictions, this package must be manually downloaded
from the Loki web site:
