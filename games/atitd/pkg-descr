- NVIDIA users may have to reinstall the nvidia-driver port as installing
  this port may cause the linux_dri port to be installed.  Alternately move
  the /compat/linux/usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.* libraries out of the way.
- DRI users may experience problems whose solution may be a more up to date
  version of MesaGL (ports/graphics/mesagl).
