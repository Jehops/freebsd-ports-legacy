This package contains the files to run a FreeBSD Half-Life
Natural Selection server under Linux emulation.

Frontiermen fighting The Khara. Marines fighting Space Mongols.
This is a simplification of the plot of Natural Selection. However,
there is a lot more to it.

Real Time Simulation (RTS) meets First Person Shooter (FPS). Players
can assume role of commanders issuing orders to other players who
can judge if they should or not obey. A strategical RTS FPS.
