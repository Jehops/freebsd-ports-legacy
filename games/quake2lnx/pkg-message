===================================================

    Install additional mission paks and mods in
    ${DATADIR}/ directory.

    You must also own full (registered) version
    of Quake II, or rebuild the port with "make
    -DWITH_SHAREWARE_DATA" to install demo ver-
    sion data files.  Note that you do not need
    full version to run dedicated server.

    If you decide to build Xatrix/Rogue mission
    packs, you'll need to copy their data files
    to ${DATADIR}/xatrix|rogue/
    directory from installation CD.
