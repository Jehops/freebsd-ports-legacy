The main goal is to destroy all enemy buildings.
Therefoe you have to produce vihecels. Every car needs a controller,
and every controlstation can control five cars.

Furthermore you needs energie to build cars and buildings, and every
car and building needs energie each round. So you first should build some
energie producers.

Special buildings:

Cannon 1+2: Attacs vihecels, very strong, large range, but can not move.
Reserch Center: Allows you to build other cars and buildings
Radar: Allows you, to see what happens.
