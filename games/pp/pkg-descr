The main goal is to destroy all enemy buildings.
Therefor you have to produce vehicles. Every car needs a controller,
and every control station can control five cars.

Furthermore you need energy to build cars and buildings, and every
car and building needs energy each round. So you first should build some
energy producers.

Special buildings:

Cannon 1+2: Attacks vehicles, very strong, large range, but cannot move.
Reserch Center: Allows you to build other cars and buildings.
Radar: Allows you to see what happens.
