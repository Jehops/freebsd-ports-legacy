A GUI chess front-end to crafty, for the GNOME Desktop Environment

It works with chess programs and chess servers - it is also a PGN viewer.
For chess programs, it works best with the chess engine crafty 
(ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt) but most features should also work with
GNU Chess (ftp://ftp.gnu.org).
