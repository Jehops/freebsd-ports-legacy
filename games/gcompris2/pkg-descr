GCompris is a simple education game. The basic goal is to teach to children
starting at 3 how to use a mouse and keybord. It is designed so that it is easy
to add new boards. First board is a simple click on me game. Animals images are
falling down the sky. Click on them before they reach the ground. Second board
uses the same falling concept but the animals are replaced by letters. Instead
of clicking, of course you have now to enter the proper key. Third board uses
the same concept but with words. English, French and Spanish supported.
