BattleBall is essentially the game of soccer, played with military
vehicles rather than with people.  Each player drives a tank or flies
a helicopter, and tries to move the ball down the playfield to the
other team's goal.  In BattleBall, the teams' "goals" are their
headquarters buildings, positioned at the ends of the playfield.
Hitting another team's headquarters building with the ball scores a
point, knocking the building over in the process.  Yes, realism was
my ultimate goal in this game.

Players are organized into teams.  Up to six teams can play at once, and
teams may have any combination of human and computer players.  All teams
compete on the playfield simultaneously.  To reduce disorientation and
chaos, players' vehicles are painted with their team's colors, and
headquarters buildings are marked with their team's insignia.
