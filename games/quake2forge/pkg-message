===============================================

Install pak0.pak, models, skins and additional
stuff in ${PREFIX}/share/quake2

To play the official Quake 2 levels, you have
to copy/link pak0.pak, players and video from
Install/Data/baseq2 on the Quake 2 CD to the
${PREFIX}/share/quake2/baseq2 directory.

If you experience problems with mouse move-
ments when running in GLX-Mode, try setting
in_dgamouse to 1.

ATTENTION: The Quake2Forge binary now gets 
installed as q2f instead of quake2 to avoid
conflicting with games/quake2lnx
