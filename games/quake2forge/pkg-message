Quake2Forge has been installed.

The Quake2Forge binary now gets installed as "quake2forge" instead of "quake2"
to avoid conflicting with "games/quake2lnx".

If you experience problems with mouse movements when running in GLX-Mode, try
setting in_dgamouse to 1 (this is actually for people that use the DGA X11
extension).

You can not change the gamma in SDL-Mode, but you can use "xgamma" to adjust
it before and after running Quake2Forge.
