Frogatto is a "platformer" or "jump-and-run" videogame.  Like many older
arcade/nintendo/sega titles, the world is viewed as a cross-section seen
from the side, and your character walks and jumps between solid platforms,
whilst avoiding being hurt by monsters.  We're not a clone of any specific
game; although just by being a platformer, it's impossible not to have
something in common with games like Mario or Sonic.  So we are trying to
innovate a bit.

Frogatto is also the protagonist's name.  It's eponymous.
