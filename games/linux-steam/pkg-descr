Steam is Valve's new way of getting games into your hands ASAP. Games like
Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Counter-Strike Condition Zero
are all being made available through Steam.

Steam games are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest content
and revisions. Steam also includes an instant-message client which
even works while you're in-game.

At its core, Steam is a distributed file system and shared set of technology
components that can be implemented into any software application.

With Steam, developers are given integrated tools for direct-content
publishing, flexible billing, ensured-version
control, anti-cheating, anti-piracy, and more.
