HLDS Update Tool (more truthfully named Steam):

Steam allows you to download the game content necessary to run a 
Half-Life Dedicated Server or Source Dedicated Server.  The downloaded
content can also be updated to the newest revisions and patches
automatically with the use of Steam.

This port installs the Linux version of Steam, as no FreeBSD version
exists.
