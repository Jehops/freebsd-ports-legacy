XRacer is a Wipeout clone. At the moment it is incomplete, but
I will be working on the following areas over the next few
weeks:
  * better game physics (eg. sometimes the craft turns over)
  * instrument panel (partially done)
  * scenery
  * time trial and arcade mode
  * weapons, powerups
  * LAN multiplayer mode
