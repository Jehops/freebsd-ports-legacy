Xtet42 is a one or two player version of T*tris. The game was written
by Hugo Eide Gunnarsen in 1991. The game is very fun and very
addictive. It is also astonishingly pretty to be an old X11-game.

In january 1999 I picked up the code to get rid of a few bugs and
limitations that annoyed me. I also converted the build-mechanism to
GNU autoconf.

The result is xtet42-2.21.
