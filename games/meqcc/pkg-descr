This is a modification to the Quake-C compiler from id Software.  It allows
for creating a `progs.dat' which cannot be decompiled to Quake-C source code.
As an added bonus a `progs.dat' which cannot be decompiled is a lot smaller.
The compiler also has a C compatible precompiler.  A description of the
precompiler directives can be found in a regular C manual.
