The pydance package has been successfully installed.

NB:  A sample configuration file has been installed to %%PREFIX%%/etc as
"pydance.cfg.sample". This should be renamed to "pydance.cfg" and edited
to suit the requirements of a particular site (for example in order
to add song directories).

For some reason, MP3 playback seems to be broken here or in
devel/py-game. Please inform me if you get it working. OggVorbis
files however should work fine.
