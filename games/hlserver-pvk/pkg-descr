[from developer's site]
Pirates, Vikings, and Knights (PVK) is a modification for Valve
Software's Half-Life that pits three teams from asynchronous time
periods-- pirates, Vikings, and knights-- against one another (most
often) in a teamplay battle. Each team has three unique classes,
each with their own strengths and weaknesses, giving PVK a diversity
unmatched in Half-Life mods. Unlike other mods, PVK is set in
various historical settings, where close-combat was a standard.
Many characters lack any long distance weapon, and the others'
projectile weapons are often inaccurate or cumbersome to use.
Slash and hack can be much more useful than camping and sniping,
giving many new elements to multiplayer gaming.
