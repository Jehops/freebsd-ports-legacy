The Caribbean Sea in the late 16th century: The Dutch, French, English and 
Spanish crown aim to expand their areas of influence. You as an 
auspiscious young captain are trying to make the best of it, as you may 
either become a brave merchant soul, a freebooting hero of your crown or a 
bloodlusty dreaded pirate leader.
