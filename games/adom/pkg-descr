Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game
which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration
of a dungeon complex (and in the case of ADOM a few other games of
this genre: the exploration of a large wilderness area with
villages and many special locations). You control a fictional
character described by race, class, attributes, skills, and
equipment. This fictional character is trying to achieve a specific
goal and succeed in a difficult quest. To fulfill the
quest, you have to explore previously undiscovered tunnels and
dungeons, fight hideous monsters, uncover long forgotten secrets,
and find treasures of all kind.

Please read manual in /usr/local/share/doc/adom (or wherever ${PREFIX} was
pointing) after installation.

You may have to build terminfo database in order to run ADOM. Read "readme.1st"
section VI.E for details.
