The default renderer has switched to OpenGL2. Should you encounter
a performance drop with this update, you can return to the old
OpenGL1 rendere by executing:

	ioquake3-devel +seta cl_renderer opengl1

If you have chosen to build without the DLRENDERER option OpenGL1
is used by default, OpenGL2 can be used by executing the
`iqouake3_opengl2-devel` binary.
