King of the Hill (KOTH) is a multiplayer, networked artillery game of 
little tanks with really big weapons set out to destroy one another. 

Best-known games of this type include the classic DOS game "Scorched 
Earth: The Mother of All Games" and "Scorched Tanks" for the Amiga, but 
the concept has been implemented on everything from the TI-85 graphing 
calculator on up. KOTH seeks to build on the best ideas from these games 
while also taking a fresh approach including an open, network-centric 
architecture and concurrent progressive event modeling.
