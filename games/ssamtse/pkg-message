Serious Sam - The Second Encounter linux binaries are now
installed. But it's up to you to copy SSam data files
to %SSAMDIR%.

Also, you need to edit ssamtse executable (this is a shell
script) to set correct CPU frequency in SERIOUS_MHZ variable.
This variable can also be passed to make at port build time.

I hope, this will be fixed someday...
(especially if someone mails me file list
of original game CD)
