After creating an Algorithm::Pair::Best->new object, add a list of items 
(players) to be paired. add connects the new items into a linked list. The 
linked list must consist of an even number of items or you'll get an error 
when you try to pick the pairs.

Pairings are determined partially by the original order items were added, 
but more importantly, items are paired based on scores which are 
determined by an info hash used to attach any random data to the item, and 
user supplied functions to provide a score for each item in relation to 
other items. It may be convenient to add access methods to the 
Algorithm::Pair::Best package from the main namespace (see the scoreSubs 
option to new below for an example).
