What is PySol-Cardsets ?
========================

A collection of free cardsets adapted for use with PySol.
I'm distributing this as its own package because I want to
keep the main distribution reasonable small.

PySol-Cardsets should work with any PySol version >= 2.00,
but version 4.00 or better is strongly recommended.

PySol-Cardsets is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL). The file COPYRIGHT in each of the cardset
directories contains additional information about the original authors.
