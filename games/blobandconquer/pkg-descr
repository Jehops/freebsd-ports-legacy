Blob and Conquer is a mission and objective based 3D action game.
This is episode 2 of the Blob Wars saga (see /usr/ports/games/blobwars).

With the apparent defeat of Galdov and the reclaiming of the Fire,
Time, Space and Reality Crystals the Blobs' battle was only just
beginning. Bob had rescued many Blobs and fought many battles, but
now he had an ever bigger task ahead of him. The Blobs' homeworld
is still littered with the alien forces and Bob once again makes
it his task to lead the counter attack. But even without Galdov the
aliens are still extremely well organised...
