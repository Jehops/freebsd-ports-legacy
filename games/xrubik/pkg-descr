Xrubik, X-based rubik's cube(tm)

    Click on the left mouse button to move a piece.  Release it on a
      piece in the same row and on the face.  The puzzle will then turn
      towards where the mouse button was released.
    Click on the middle mouse button toggle the practice mode. (This is
      good for learning moves).  Also 'P' or 'p' do the same thing.
      One must double click on the middle mouse button if the puzzle is
      being worked on.
    Click on the right mouse button if you want to randomize the puzzle.
      Also 'R' or 'r' do the same thing.  One must double click on
      the right mouse button if the puzzle is being worked on.
    'I' or 'i' to increase the number of cubes.
    'D' or 'd' to decrease the number of cubes.
    'O' or 'o' to toggle orient mode. (I prefer the orient mode since
      it is slightly more challenging).
    'S', 's' to auto-solve.  It only works on 1x1x1, 2x2x2, 3x3x3 cubes.
      For the 3x3x3 it only solves it in the non-orient mode.
    'U' or 'u' to undo last move.
    'G' or 'g' to get a saved puzzle.
    'W' or 'w' to write or save a puzzle.
    'Q', 'q', or Control-C to kill program.

    Key pad is defined for 2d rubik as:
        /
 
        8
        ^
    4 < 5 > 6
        v
        2

    The key pad along with the use of the mouse will allow you to move the
    cube i.e.,
              KP_DIVIDE=>CCW
              KP_8=>Top
    KP=>Left  KP_5=>CW        KP_6=>Right
              KP_2=>Bottom

    Key pad for 3d rubik, use your intuition (is this a cop out or what?).
    The key pad is defined differently depending on which side of the cube
    your mouse is pointing at. One thing that stays the same is KP_5=>CW.

    The control key allows you to move the whole cube at once without
    being entered as a move.  Hold down the control key while using the
    left mouse button or the keypad.
    One has to orient the faces in orient mode, besides getting all the
    faces to be the same color. To do this one has to get the lines to
    be oriented in the same direction, this only matters with center
    cubes (i.e. those cubes not on a corner or edge). This does add
    complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

    Try resizing the cube. Notice the puzzle resizes to take advantage
    of the "room" available.

    The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
        xrubik{2|3}d: {1|2|3|4|5|6} @ (<Number of moves>/\
                {<Record number of moves>|NEVER|PRACTICE}) - <Comment>
    {2|3}: current dimensional view
    {1|2|3|4|5|6}: number of cubes per edge
    {<Record...}: puzzle is either in practice mode or record mode
       In record mode, if there is no record of the current puzzle, it
       displays "NEVER".

    If you were looking for a auto-solver, sorry. One of the problems in
    auto-solvers the generally don't work for different number of cuts.
    If you know of one let me know. There is a real neat 3x3x3 cube called
    "magiccube" with a better 3-D look, a auto-solver, and Motif. Use
    "archie" to find "magiccube" at the site nearest you.
