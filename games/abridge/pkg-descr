Bridge is a bridge game that allows you to play bridge online with other
real people. It is currently available for UNIX (including linux),
Microsoft Windows and MacOS X. On all platforms, aBridge supports speech
synthesis, allowing you to choose listen to the bids and chat conversation
rather than simply gazing at the screen waiting for someone to play.
aBridge also has some rudimentary bots, for when other players aren't
online, but their AI is pretty pathetic, and they are in need of a
complete rewrite.
