   Linux version of Return to Castle Wolfenstein has been installed.

   To be able to play the game, you need to copy the files "mp_pak0.pk3",
   "pak0.pk3", and "sp_pak1.pk3" from the RtCW distribution (in the "main"
   subdirectory) to your $HOME/.wolf/main directory.

   Below is the list of required packfiles, with their MD5 checksums:

   MD5 (main/mp_pak0.pk3) = 62641cffd9a8ad0f62cc1cca867d51f8
   MD5 (main/pak0.pk3) = ce92b11df889cb0a045762bb5fd7cde5
   MD5 (main/sp_pak1.pk3) = a0d3fe956f85f40c8efd6babe0d09832
