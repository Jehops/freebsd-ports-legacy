Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a remake of sorts of the early, seminal
first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D. However, with the advances in graphics
technology and gameplay design since the original game, without the name and
the occasional in-game references, it would be unrecognisable as a remake.
Unlike the original Wolfenstein 3D, only a handful of the single player
missions in Return to Castle Wolfenstein takes place in the infamous
castle/prison.
