Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a remake of sorts of the id's early, seminal
first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D. However, with the advances in graphics
technology and gameplay design since the original game, without the name and
the occasional in-game references, it would be unrecognizable as a remake.

Unlike the original Wolfenstein 3D, only a handful of the single player
missions in Return to Castle Wolfenstein takes place in the infamous castle
and prison.
