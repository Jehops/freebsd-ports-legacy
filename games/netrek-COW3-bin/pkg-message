The Netrek client is now installed.  You may start it by typing "netrek".

Be sure and read the Netrek web site (http://www.netrek.org/) before you
play!  It contains many useful documents for the new (and not-so-new)
Netrek player, including the Netrek FAQ.  Highly recommended reading!

NOTE: Since this client was compiled, the address of the Netrek metaserver
has changed.  The new metaserver address is "metaserver.netrek.org">
To fix this, please insert the following into your ${HOME}/.netrekrc
file:

metaserver:		metaserver.netrek.org

NOTE 2: This client, since it is still in development, has an expiration
date.  The current version of the client will expire on Fri, 4/16/99.
I will be sure and update the port before this expiration date, when the
next version of the client comes out. :)

Enjoy, have fun, and may you live long and prosper...
