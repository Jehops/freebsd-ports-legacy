Elite: The New Kind - a remake of 1984's 8-bit classic space combat and
trading game "Elite" by Ian Bell and David Braben.

There remains a large contingent of veteran gamers who maintain that the Bell
and Braben classic Elite was the greatest computer game of all time.  This
remake - Elite: The New Kind - was produced by reverse engineering the
original disk-based version of Elite on the BBC Microcomputer.  However, it
was updated with shaded polygon graphics and most of the enhanced gameplay
elements which characterised later versions of Elite.

Snapshots of the original Elite for various emulators (including some which
will run on FreeBSD) may be downloaded from co-author Ian Bell's Elite site:
