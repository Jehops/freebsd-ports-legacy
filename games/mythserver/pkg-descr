This is the source code for Bungie's MythII metaserver, the
backend server system that supported MythII online play over
the Internet for several years. The day has come for Bungie's
MythII server to be retired. This source code for the server
is being released so that the Myth community will have a
starting point for creating their own Myth server system,
should the need or desire to do so arise.
