Battle for Mandicor is a free (as in freedom) real time strategy game using
the Stratagus game engine. Stratagus is a free cross-platform RTS (Real Time
Strategy) game engine written in C, and scripted with Lua. Stratagus has been
used for many games, Battle for Mandicor being one of them.

The fantasy world called Mandicor is much like Tolkien's Middle-Earth and has
a long history. Though not yet finished, a player can control four races in
game; dwarves, gnomes, humans, and goblins. Each has advantages and
disadvantages within the game. While playing, you need to collect resources,
train large armies, and research items in order to create a more powerful
society and defeat the enemy. Campaigns, yet to be finished, will be based
upon a long and interesting history.
