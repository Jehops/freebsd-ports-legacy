Star Fleet Battles Online (SFBOL) is developed in cooperation with Amarillo 
Design Bureau, Inc. to be a Star Fleet Battles game service. Subscribers are
able to play SFB games over the internet with other subscribers around the world
. SFBOL is designed to allow subscribers to compete in an environment that
emulates face to face play. The difference is the computer interface which
augments or automates many of the mundane tasks of game play such as energy
allocation, moving counters across the map, dice rolling and damage allocation. 
Subscribers may play as many games as they like during their subscription period
. Throughout the year Franz Games will host exclusive online Rated Ace 
Tournaments and subscribers can also compete year round via an online ranking 
system.
