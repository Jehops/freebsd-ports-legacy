Program to play (interactively solve) crosswords. It currently supports only 
.puz and .txt files, but can support other formats if people notify me of them.

The .puz and .txt formats are otherwise known as the AcrossLite formats, from 
Literate Software Systems (see http://www.litsoft.com/). The .txt format is 
an older version that has been replaced by the .puz format.
