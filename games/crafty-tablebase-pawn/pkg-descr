These are the pawn 3/4/5 tablebases for crafty's endgames.  They take
up about 5.1G...

Be warned that all of these togther (both tablebase ports) will eat up
around 7.1 Gigs of your disk space, or 14.2G, if you don't delete the
distfiles (I highly recommend doing this, as these files almost never
change).
