This is the port of the "rock" opening book for crafty.  It is very
large.

It was created with "book create book.txt 60 3" (see the crafty
documentation and online help for a more thorough explanation of what
this does) which discards all openings not played in at least three
games which I expect to be a reasonable constant, but I am open to
suggestions on this.
