This is a port of a multiplayer-only DOS game where the players are bunnies,
and the goal is to jump on the other bunnies, destroying them in a bloody
explosion. This game also has a screensaver mode, which is a parody of the
classic xscreensaver pyro hack, except that bunnies explode instead of
fireworks.

Network support is currently broken, but the authors threaten to fix it
in a future release.

Hundreds of alternate levels are available on the website.
