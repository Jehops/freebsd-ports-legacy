This is an 3-D network play tank battle game for UNIX/X with Mesa or OpenGL.
It is similar to the old "Battle Zone" arcade game and the game "Spectre"
for the Mac.  You drive a tank through a 3-D rendered world, dodging and
fighting all the other tanks.  You can have either robotic opponents
(computer controlled), human opponents across a network, or a combination
of the two.  A variety of features (fog/night vision conditions, heads
up display, etc.) make game play varied and more interesting.

This program was written as a final project for a computer graphics
course, and was originally developed under Linux.
