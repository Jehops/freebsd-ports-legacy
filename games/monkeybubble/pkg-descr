GTK2 Puzzle Bobble clone. With monkeys. Frozen Bubble, but
with monkeys. It's like a game, except SO MUCH MORE, because
it has monkeys.

Note that the game seems to want a couple hundred megs of
memory to start, but once the UI comes up, it only consumes
about 25MB. The game plays fine, but someone still needs to
track down exactly why this memory appears on FreeBSD (and
not on Linux).
