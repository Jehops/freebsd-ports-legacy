GTK2 Puzzle Bobble clone. With monkeys. Frozen Bubble, but
with monkeys. It's like a game, except SO MUCH MORE, because
it has monkeys.

Note that the game seems to want a couple hundred megs of
memory to start, but once the UI comes up, it only consumes
about 25MB. We're working on it, but the game plays fine.
