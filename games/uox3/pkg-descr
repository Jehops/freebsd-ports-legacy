UOX3 is the "Ultima Offline eXperiment", a GPL'd server for Origin
Systems' Ultima Online multiplayer fantasy role playing (FRPG) game.

This program is a full-featured Ultima Online server.  It implements
everything you would need to run a fully functional UO game (monsters,
spawn sites, vendors, guard zones, etc.).

This game includes a "world file" that has most towns fully developed
(i.e. all vendors installed), plus many fully-active spawn sites
scattered throughout the land.  Of course, you can fully customize
this "world", deleting anything you don't like and adding new stuff!

With this server, you can play by yourself, or with up to 32 players
over your local area network (or over the Internet!).  This server
package is being used by many player-run games available on the Internet.
Yes, now YOU TOO can run your own public shard!!!

You will need to own the Ultima Online product to be able to use this
server.  Some files from your game directory will need to be copied to
the server directory before it will function.
