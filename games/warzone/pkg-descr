Warzone 2100 was an innovative 3D real-time strategy game back in 1999, and
most will agree it didn't enjoy the commercial success it should have had. The
game's source code was liberated on December 6th, 2004, under a GPL license
(see COPYING in this directory for details). Soon after that, the Warzone 2100
ReDev project was formed to take care of its future.

Our goal is to make warzone run on all possible platforms. Therefore, we
stripped the original code of all proprietary technologies and replaced them
with cross-platform and free equivalents, like OpenGL, OpenAL, etc... Right
now, Warzone 2100 works very well on Windows and GNU/Linux, and we have even
heard of it running on BSD with no particular issue.
