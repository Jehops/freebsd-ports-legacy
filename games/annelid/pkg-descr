Analog Annelid is a remake of the ubiquitous "Snake" and "Worm" games in which
the player controls the movement of such a creature in an attempt to collect
apples, numbers, or whatever. Upon collecting these items, the creature grows
in length. This process continues until the creature collides with itself or
perhaps a wall or some other obstacle.

Most of these games only allow the hapless forager to make 90 turns. This is
for the sake of easier programming both in the game itself and in the display
of graphics.

Analog Annelid absolves itself of this stigma for a smooth, free-flowing game
world and more complex gameplay.
