This package contains the files to run a FreeBSD Half-Life
The Specialists server under Linux emulation.

Firefights, depending from the various gameplays that will be listed,
will be both spectacular due to our stunt moves as well as spectacular
for a new implemented particellar system, new muzzle flashes and
weapons' realistic power. Players can shot down an enemy just with
a burst of 9mm as well as a single shotgun shot.

Users will be able to choose if behave as an action man (use of
light equipment, small caliber guns) taking advantage of their
agility or behave as a specialist using large caliber weapons, which
affect agility but improve firepower. Its also possible to close
any encounter with an headshot, which is, almost in all cases,
lethal. But now dont stay here, take a look to all The Specialists
(TS from now on) new features!
