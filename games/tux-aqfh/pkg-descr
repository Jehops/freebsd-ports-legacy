TUXEDO T. PENGUIN: A QUEST FOR HERRING

A nice 3D graphics adventure game.

The author's goal is to end up with a game that's similar to some of the
console games like Mario'64, Banjo-Kazooie, Gex or Spiro the dragon.
He'd like more emphasis on search-and-explore and puzzle solving and less
on violence and mass killing. Graphical quality is less important than
game-play and fun.
