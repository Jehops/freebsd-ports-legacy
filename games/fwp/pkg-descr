Fight Win Prevail (or FWP for short) is a multiplayer first person
shooter.

The game is set in an imaginary universe where fearless pilots fight
to the death with their futuristic vehicles. Gameplay lies somewhere
between the Mechwarrior-series and Quake 3. It is faster and more
action-orientated than in Mechwarrior, but tries to avoid the
'jump-around-like-crazy-and-fire-at-everything-that-moves'-gameplay
known from Quake 3.

Fight Win Prevail is a pure multiplayer game and does not have a
real singleplayer mode. Our primary target are LANs, but the game
is playable over the internet, too.
