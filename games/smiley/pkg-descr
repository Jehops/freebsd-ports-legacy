smiley(1) is a "smiley server" I wrote for my own pleasure.  It can
explain any smiley it knows, or print one it knows at random.  I use
it to generate a random prompt when there is a status line available
to hold the information I would otherwise put into my prompt.  Hence
smiley(1) does not contain the invisible smiley or any multi-line
smileys.
