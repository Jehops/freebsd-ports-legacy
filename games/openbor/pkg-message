To play a module copy its .pak file under ~/.openbor/Paks/ directory.
If only one file is there OpenBOR would run the module on startup,
otherwise module launcher would appear.

In case a module has data/ directory unpacked you may need to run it
as follows:

  $ cd /path/to/module
  $ cp -R ~/.openbor/Saves .
  $ OPENBOR_USE_CURDIR=1 openbor
