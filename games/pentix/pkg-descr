This is a game of pentix for terminals

pentix is one of the various flavours of good old tetris.
however, pentix surpassed its famous parent in playbility

this version of pentix is based on the original msdos version of
pentix by Marta & Adrian Soncodi (C) 1986 ICE/APP
which is considered standard of pentix

I've tried to keep this port and the original version as alike as possible
in all relevant respects

Play Pentix!
