Thunder&Lightning is a futuristic action flight simulator and
realtime strategy game that takes place in a large 3D environment.
Jump into the pilot seat of your Lightning aircraft and fight against
Thunder tanks in a fierce battle for control of the island!

Apart from flight simulators, Thunder&Lightning takes inspiration
from (but is not a clone or remake of) the 80's classic Carrier
Command. This means that you will find yourself in control of a
futuristic carrier with aircraft and amphibious tanks at your
disposal. In the long run, there will be multiple Islands to conquer,
each with its own defense strategy.

Although Thunder&Lightning already supports missions, it aims to
be an open-ended game with a dynamically developing world with
scripted events on some occasions.
