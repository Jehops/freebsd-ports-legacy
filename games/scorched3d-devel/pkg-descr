Scorched is a game based loosely on the classic DOS game Scorched
Earth "The Mother Of All Games".

	"Scorched Earth is a simple, yet exciting artillery combat
	game, based on an auspicious history of artillery games."

	(Review of Scorched Earth at ClassicGaming.com)

In its simplest form Scorched is an artillery game. Tanks take turns
to earn money by destroying opponents in an arena. Scorched attempts
to recreate the simple yet addictive game play of the original game,
adding amongst other new features a 3D island environment and LAN and
internet play.

NOTE:

	This is a work in progress port of the Win32 game by
	Gavin C. <gcamp@cisco.com>.  The port is done by
	red.zebra@pandora.be for Linux.  Network play does
	not work yet.
