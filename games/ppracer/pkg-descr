PlanetPenguin Racer is an OpenGL racing game featuring Tux, the
Linux mascot. The goal of the game is to slide down a snow- and
ice-covered mountain as quickly as possible. It is based on the
GPL version of TuxRacer. 

Differences from TuxRacer include:
	* Course progress bar
	* Themes
	* New terrain types (lava, etc.)
	* Actively developed!
