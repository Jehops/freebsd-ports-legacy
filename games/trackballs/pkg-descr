Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness
on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth
filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player
collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues
at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out. 

It should be noted that this game is not intended to be a replica of 
marble madness but rather inspired by it. For instance the game uses 
advanced 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for 
it. Also we aim at making the game highly configurable by a scripting 
extension (Guile) and provide a simple editor by which new levels easily 
can be created. The current status of the project is very early in 
development and is thus barely playable.

You start /Trackballs/ by giving the command 'trackballs' which
instructs the game to load the first level. If you wish to cheat or simply
are testing out a level you are currently designing you can give the command
'trackballs -l foo' which jumps to level "foo".
