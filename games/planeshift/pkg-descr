The objective of the PlaneShift is to create a virtual fantasy world in which a
player can start as a peasant in search of fame and become a hero. First of all
PlaneShift is a Role Playing Game. Be sure to read our Roleplay guidelines or
you will not be able to play this game. We will focus our efforts in the
reproduction of a real world with politics, economy, many non-player-characters
controlled by the server that will bring to life our world even without players
connected!

We want to give FREE access to everyone, without the need to either purchase
the game or pay a monthly fee. Servers and bandwidth will be donated by 
sponsors.

Our virtual world is persistent, and this means you can connect to it at every
hour of day or night and you will always find players and npcs wandering our
realms. You will be able to disconnect and reconnect again, the server saves
the actual status of your character including his possessions.

You will use a client program to interact with our world, that enables you to
have a 3D view of the surroundings.
