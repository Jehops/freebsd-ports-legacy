xmine is an X11-based version of the popular PC game Minesweeper. The
object is to place flags on mines on the game board without exposing
them.

xmine is freely redistributable.  It's mostly Xlib-based, but it
requires Motif libraries for the menus.

This version of xmine is based on Paul Falstad's version 1.0.3, as
published in comp.sources.x. It has been heavily munged to work
without OSF/Motif.

Almost everything needed was already in the Athena Widget Set, with
the exception of a Canvas Widget (or DrawingAreaWidget in Motif
terms).  Hence i have included a copy of the Canvas Widget of the Free
Widget Foundation, only slightly modified to take the #include's from
the current directory. If anybody is unlucky with the GPL conditions
applying to the FWF code, she is free to drop in own versions of a
Canvas Widget (really not much of code).

I originally intented to #ifdef Paul's version for use with the Athena
Widget Set, but realized that this would have resulted in too much of
spagghetti code. That's why i hacked a separate source out of it. I
cleaned it up a bit, so it will compile now without complaints with
the -Wall flag set under gcc.

Since the game itself has some 3D look, linking against the famous
Xaw3d library is highly recommended.
