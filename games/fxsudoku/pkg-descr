fxsudoku is an implementation of the Sudoku game.

The aim of Sudoku is to enter a numerical digit from 1 through 9
in each cell of a 99 grid made up of 33 subgrids (called "regions"),
starting with various digits given in some cells (the "givens").
Each row, column, and region must contain only one instance of each
numeral. Completing the puzzle requires patience and logical ability.
