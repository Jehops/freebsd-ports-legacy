==========================================================================

    This Jagged Alliance 2 port requires data files from the original
    game CD and installation.  Copy the following files:

    Put all *.slf files into ${DATADIR}/Data.
    Put all *.jsd and *.sti files from the TILECACHE directory into
    ${DATADIR}/Data/TILECACHE.
    All filenames must be lowercase!
    After copying you can use "make lowercase" to rename all files.

    Enjoy!
