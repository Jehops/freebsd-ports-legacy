Crossword Generator generates crosswords from scratch to PostScript. It just
needs the board and a dictionary and it fills it up. It uses an optimized
branch and bound algorithm to try all the posible combinations. There is also
an optional heuristic to speed up the process. This heuristic is not exhastive,
but it gives much better time that the normal one. When the crossword is ready
it can translate it into TeX format so that it can be compiled using LaTeX.
