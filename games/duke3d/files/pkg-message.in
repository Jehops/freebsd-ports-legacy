Icculus Duke Nukem 3D Port has been successfully installed.

You still need the original Duke Nukem 3D data files. Please copy the following
files to the %%DATADIR%% directory:

DUKE3D.GRG
DUKE3D.CFG (optional)
SETUP.EXE (optional)
SETMAIN.EXE (optional)

Be sure to run the fix.sh script inside %%DATADIR%% afterwards. This step is
mandatory.

The release notes can be found in %%DOCSDIR%%.

If you have any problems with running this port please contact the maintainer
of this port and NOT the people at Icculus.

NOTE: This port is based on a CVS snapshot and should be considered unstable.
Frame rates are very low due to a SDL sound bug in combination with FreeBSD. A
lot of features that were part of the original Duke Nukem 3D retail release are
either not present or not working in this release.

Thx.
