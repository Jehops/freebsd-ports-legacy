You need to copy the following files from the Duke Nukem 3D CD-ROM or from the Sharware
release to %%DUKEDIR%%:

DUKE3D.GRP
DUKE3D.CFG
SETUP.EXE
SETMAIN.EXE

Afterwards you have to run %%DUKEDIR%%/fix.sh

If you want to edit your config run dosbox, mount %%DUKEDIR%%
and run SETUP.EXE. Be sure you have write permission. Otherwise your
changes will get lost.

WARNING: Icculus Duke3D port is still in alpha stage and runs very slowly!

Thx go out to

mezz @ bsdforums.org for cleaning up the code and testing it on -CURRENT
clement for his problem reports
