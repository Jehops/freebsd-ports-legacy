Duke3D for Linux

This port was done by Dan Olson, Steven Fuller, and Ryan C. Gordon, 
with contributions from David Koenig, Dave Watson, among others.

The real nasty part (porting the Build Engine) was the work of:

    * Ryan C. Gordon
    * Dan Olson
    * Andrew Henderson
    * Christian Zander
    * Adrian Neill
    * Matt Helsley
    * Nicholas Vining
    * Matt Saettler
    * Steven Fuller
    * A cast of thousands.
