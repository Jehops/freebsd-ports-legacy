Nexuiz is a fast-paced, chaotic, and intense multiplayer first person
shooter, focused on providing basic, old style deathmatch.  This release
includes 17 maps, 28 playable characters, and 10 music tracks.

Nexuiz is built on the power of the Darkplaces engine, which is a heavily
modified version of the original Quake.  Darkplaces features realtime
lighting and stencil shadows, bumpmapping, gloss, bloom, and totally
rewritten network code that supports up to 64 players on a single server.
While quality gameplay was our primary goal, it's graphics technology and
artwork allows the game to compete with the current quality of commercial
games.

Any online deathmatch fan will instantly feel at home with Nexuiz' weapons
and movement style.  The fast server browser and quick loading time allows
you to jump right into a game at a moments notice and play a quick game.
