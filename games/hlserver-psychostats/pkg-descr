PsychoStats is a statistics generator for the game Half-Life. 

It will work with any Half-Life MOD that uses the standard log 
file format as of Half-Life v1.1.0.6. However, it will only give 
basic player stats and will not show team statistics and certain 
map based statistics unless the MOD is supported fully by PsychoStats. 
Also the default themes that come with PsychoStats are specifically 
designed for Counter-Strike or Day of Defeat.
