Blackjack is an X-windows based version of the casino game. The
program is used to help learn the basic strategy of the game of
blackjack. The help level can be set from a mode that tells you
each correct move to make, to one that only warns you by a pop up
window if you make a "bad" play. Betting limits, number of decks,
number of splits, and shuffle point can be set. This program uses
the Qt toolkit.
