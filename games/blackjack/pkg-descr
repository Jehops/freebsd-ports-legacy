   This is an X windows based game of the casino game blackjack.
The program is currently written to use the Qt toolkit from Troll Tech.
For more information on Qt see "http://www.troll.no/".

   I have always enjoyed the game of blackjack.  When I first played in
a casino I lost all the money I had brought.  After reading some books 
on blackjack and the FAQ for rec.gambling.blackjack, I now know that there
is a basic strategy to follow.  The strategy is based on the odds of each
hand and the dealers up card.  I wrote this program so I could practice
the basic strategy of blackjack.  The basic strategy is in the program
and a help level can be set to help the user learn to play by these rules.
My blackjack game has improved greatly.

   I first wrote this program in tcl/tk.  It was OK, but I have trouble 
remembering all the syntax and parsing rules.  The tcl/tk version was also
noticably slow on my 386 running Linux.  Qt has been very good as a C++ 
GUI library and is not slow at all on my 386.
