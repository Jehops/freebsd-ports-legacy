Tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course within the given time.
If the ball falls or time expires, a ball is lost. Collect 100 coins to save
your progress and earn an extra ball. Red coins are worth 5. Blue coins are
worth 10.

Neverball runs under Linux, Win2K/XP, and hopefully anywhere else SDL is
supported. Hardware accellerated OpenGL support with multitexture (OpenGL 1.2.1
or greater) is required. Neverball has been tested on Intel machines as slow as
1GHz with GeForce2. Minimum system requirements may be lower.
