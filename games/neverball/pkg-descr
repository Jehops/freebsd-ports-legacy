In 1.1.5 version, the Neverball and Neverputt source trees have been merged
into one. It includes 75 Neverball levels and 18 Neverputt levels.

Neverball, tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course within the
given time. If the ball falls or time expires, a ball is lost. Collect 100
coins to save your progress and earn an extra ball. Red coins are worth 5.
Blue coins are worth 10.

Neverputt, a hot-seat multiplayer miniature golf game using the physics and
graphics of Neverball.

Neverball runs under Linux, Win2K/XP, and hopefully anywhere else SDL is
supported. Hardware accellerated OpenGL support with multitexture (OpenGL
1.2.1 or greater) is required. Neverball has been tested on Intel machines as
slow as 1GHz with GeForce2. Minimum system requirements may be lower.
