==============================================================================

SDLQuake2 has been installed.

The binaries have been renamed to "sdlquake2" and "sdlquake2-ded" to avoid
conflicting with the "games/quake2lnx" port.

The configuration will be written to the "~/.sdlquake2" directory.

The gamma can not be adjusted from the game. You can use "xgamma" to change it
before running it, and restore it later.
