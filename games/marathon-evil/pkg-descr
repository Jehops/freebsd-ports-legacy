This port contains the Marathon: Evil files, converted to run on
Aleph One.  The Aleph One application itself is in the `alephone' port.

Marathon: Evil is a third-party scenario package with all-new monsters,
maps, sounds, and so on.  This particular port is a conversion of
the original Marathon: Evil to run on Aleph One/SDL.
