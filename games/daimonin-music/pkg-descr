Daimonin is a free open source Massively Multiplayer On-line Role-playing Game
(MMORPG) under the GPL license.  Daimonin was created in the year 2002 by using
the Crossfire project source as a base.  The original idea was to create a
isometric branch of Crossfire but soon Daimonin appeared as its own project.
In the years Daimonin has become a very unique game and one of the very few
open source MMORPGs which are fully playable and still growing.
