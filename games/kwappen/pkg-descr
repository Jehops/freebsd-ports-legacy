Kwappen is a KDE board game

The goal is the reduction of the 4 columns of stones in minimal time. 
The rules of the game are very simple. 
You can move symbols (stones) on top of a column or rotate columns. 

2 or more equal stones upon the other will be removed 
4 equal card symbols in a row (e.g. 4 spades) will be removed 

The computer has his own symbol stack in the upper right corner. 
This computer symbol will be put on the top of a column after your move. 
The computer selects a column by random. 

You win, if all columns have only 1 stone or empty. You lose, if one column 
has 10 or more stones after the column shrink.
