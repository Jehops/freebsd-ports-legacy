Quake II: Ground Zero (Rogue) Mission Pack.

Take out the Big Gun sounded simple enough, except the Strogg were waiting.
You, and a few marines like you, are the lucky ones. You've made it down in
one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the
Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With
the fleet around Stroggos, 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number
dwindling by the second, your orders have change: free your comrades. Destroy
the Gravity Well.

- New Enemies -- The Stalker, Turrets, Daedalus, Medic Commander, Carrier, and
  the Black Widow.
- 14 Entirely new levels and 10 new deathmatch levels.
- New Power-Ups -- Deathmatch specific power-ups: Vengeance Sphere, Hunter
  Sphere, and Anti-matter bomb.
- New Weapons -- The Chainsaw, ETF Rifle and Plasma Beam.

This port installs the game.so file, but you still need the original data.
