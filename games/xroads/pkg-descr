XRoads is a game for the X Window System that attempts to be like the
game Crossroads (and it's sequel, Pandemonium) for the Commodore 64.
Basically, it is a 2-dimensional, overhead view maze game in which you
fight against a gang of monsters. There are (or at least, there will be)
tons of different twists in the game which make it fun.
