Warzone2100 has been installed.

If the game locks up in heavy fight (e.g. many units firing at each other) try
to set OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE to 8192 before running it.

$ env OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE=8192 warzone2100

Or set the environment variable in your shell's configuration file (you can
also run these commands directly from the command-line).

For sh/bash add in your /etc/profile or ~/.profile:
export OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE=8192

For csh/tcsh add in your /etc/csh.cshrc or ~/.cshrc:
setenv OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE=8192

Enjoy!
