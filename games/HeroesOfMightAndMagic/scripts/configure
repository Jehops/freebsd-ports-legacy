Welcome to the Heroes of Might And Magic 3 installer.
You may now choose to install parts of the distribution on disk. 
If you choose not to install a part, I will make a link to the CDROM 
so you will have them in case you have your CD mounted while you play.
You must have your CDROM mounted right now.
