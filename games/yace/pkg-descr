Here you can find Yace, which is a program that automatically creates
corewar-warriors, using a genetic algorithm. Yace was a modified version of
ga_war.c, another corewar evolver (many thanks to Jason Boer), but in the
latest release there is not much code left from ga_war. I also want to thank M
Joonas Pihlaja for his Corewar Simulator exhaust, which is released under the
GPL.
