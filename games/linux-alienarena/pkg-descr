AA2K7 is the latest version of a freeware online deathmatch game that was
first introduced to the public in October, 2004. Since that initial release,
nearly every aspect of the game has been revamped, in fact, much of the
content and code from the November 2005 release of Alien Arena 2006 has been
redone as well.  It's like an entirely new game, and it may shock people just
how much it has improved in less than a year's time. With 35 levels, five
modes of play, loads of mutators, built-in bots, 11 player characters, 8
weapons(with alt-fire modes), the game has an endless supply of replayability.
With so many new features, AA2K7 is nearly an entirely new game when held in
comparison to it's predecessor. With the trials and tribulations of software
development, endless hours of playing, gathering feedback, COR Entertainment
has been able to not only fine tune and perfect it's flagship game, but add
completely new dimensions to it.

Note: this port contains the Linux version of Alien Arena. See
"games/alienarena" for the native version.
