ScummVM is an implementation of LucasArts S.C.U.M.M. (Script Creation Utility
for Maniac Mansion) interpreter, used in games such as Monkey Island, Indiana
Jones, Day Of The Tentacle, Sam and Max, and many more. Some things are still
missing, and some games cannot be completeted yet. There are quite a few known
bugs. Regardless of the bugs it is still possible to play some games all the
way through to the end. Still other games do not load at all.
