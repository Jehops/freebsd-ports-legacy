  x11/linux-nvidia-libs(-xxx) port.

Setup:

1. Create a dedicated FreeBSD non-wheel user account for Steam. Switch to it.
2. Run `steam-install` to download the Steam bootstrap executable.
3. Run `steam` to download updates and start Steam.

Limitations:

- Sandbox is disabled for the web browser component.
- Valve Anti-Cheat doesn't seem to work properly.
- No controller input, no streaming, no VR.
- No Proton (Steam Play).
