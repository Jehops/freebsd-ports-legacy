Description:

       Use "mouse-left" to move ccw.

       Use "mouse-center", "P", or "p"  to  toggle  the  practice
       mode  (in  practice mode the record should be "practice").
       One must double click on "mouse-center" if the  puzzle  is
       being worked on.

       "mouse-right",  "R",  or  "r",  to randomize (this must be
       done first to set a new record).  One must double click on
       "mouse-right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       "O" or "o" keys toggle the orient mode.

       "2",  "3",  "B",  or  "b"  keys  change modes to Period 2,
       Period 3, or Both.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved  for  the  auto-solver  (unimple-
       mented).

       "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys kill program.

       Use  the  arrows,  key pad or, "R" keys to move other than
       CCW.

       Use the control key and the keypad, or arrow keys to  move
       the whole cube.

Options:

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This  option sets the initial position of the dino
               window (resource name "geometry").

       -{foreground | fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of  the  dino
               window (resource name "foreground").

       -{background | bg} color
               This  option  specifies the background of the dino
               window (resource name "background").

       -{border | bd} color
               This option specifies  the  border  color  of  the
               cubelets  in  the dino window (resource name "bor-
               derColor").

       -mono   This option allows you to access the mono mode  on
               a color monitor (resource name "mono").

       -[no]orient
               This  option  allows you to access the orient mode
               (resource name "orient").

       -mode <int>
               This option allows you to  set  the  turning  mode
               (resource name "mode").

       -both   This  option allows you to set the turning mode to
               both period 2 and period 3 (resource  name  "mode"
               set at 4).

       -face{0|1|2|3|4|5} <color>
               This  option  allows  you to change the color of a
               face (resource name "faceColorN").  In  mono-mode,
               color  is  represented  as the first letter of the
               color name. On the  2-D  version,  the  faces  are
               ordered top to bottom and left to right on the "t"
               configuration. The "+-"  configuration  is  physi-
               cally consistent with the former, so it is ordered
               "0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4".  If you has  two  colors  that
               begin  with the same letter you should have one in
               uppercase and one in lowercase to distinguish them
               in  mono-mode.  You  can  change the colors of the
               faces to make a stupid cube (i.e. all White or  in
               mono-mode  all  "W").  Unfortunately,  it will not
               normally say its solved when its randomized.  This
               would be cheating.
