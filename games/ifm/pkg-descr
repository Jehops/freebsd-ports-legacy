Ifm (Interactive Fiction Mapper) is a language for keeping track of your
progress through an Interactive Fiction game, and a program for producing
various different sorts of output using it.  You can record each room you
visit and its relation to other rooms, the initial locations of useful
items you find, and the tasks you need to perform in order to solve the
game.

The Ifm mapping commands are designed so that you can easily add to the map
as you explore the game.  You type in the rooms you visit and the
directions you move in to reach other rooms, and Ifm calculates the
position of each room in relation to the others.  A map can consist of
several independent sections, allowing you to divide up the map however you
like.

The Ifm task commands, if used, allow you to specify the order in which
game-solving tasks must be done.  The Ifm program can then calculate and
print different styles of walkthrough for the game.
