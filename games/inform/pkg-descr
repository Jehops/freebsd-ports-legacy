This compiler produces text adventure games that can be played
using Infocom-compatible interpreters (such as jzip and xzip in
the FreeBSD Ports Collection).

This port normally installs HTML documentation in
/usr/share/doc/inform.  If you would prefer another format, such
as TeX, Postscript, or PDF, build the port with NOPORTDOCS=yes
and obtain the manual from the FTP site.  The FTP site also
contains example games and other resources.
