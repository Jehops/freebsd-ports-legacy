GMA or "The Go-Moku Apprentice" is a computerized go-moku player that
learns playing the game entirely from its opponent. It was written for
fun by Johan Walles (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) in October 1998.

The goal of Go-Moku is to get five (or more) marks in a row
(horizontally, vertically or diagonally). You get to put one mark each
time it is your turn.
