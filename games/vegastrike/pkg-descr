Vega Strike is an OpenSource 3d Space Simulator. Work is proceeding
on both the Vega Strike game engine and a Vega Strike Universe game
data set. Both engine and data are in a playable state, but still
under development. Each release serves as a beta for both engine
and data.

The project goal is, at version 1.0, is to be a generic space
simulator. Currently developed features include:

* Trading
* Exploration
* Plenty of shoot 'em up action
* Preliminary multiplayer Deathmatch (testing server only)
