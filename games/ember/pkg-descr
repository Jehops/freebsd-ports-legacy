Ember is a WorldForge 3d client using the OGRE 3d library. It's a fork from the
Dime code base. The main differences between Dime and Ember is the latters focus
on using third party libraries instead of in house development, and its
commitment to OGRE.

Some of the features are:

    * Full 3d world with dynamic terrain generation
    * Easy to use GUI system
    * Context menus for in game interaction
    * Support for experimental graphical features such as dynamically generated
      trees, realistic water and ground cover
