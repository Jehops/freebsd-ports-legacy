XSokoban is a puzzle of pushing objects. This is the X-Window version of 
'Sokoban', developed in Japan.

Usage:
       xsokoban [ -s -r -c -nn -display <disp> {-w | -walls} {-rv
       | -reverse} {-f | -font} <fn> {-b | -bitdir} <path> {-fg |
       -foregound}  <color>  {-bg  |  -backgound}  <color> {-bd |
       -border} <color> {-pr | -pointer} <color> -xrm <arg> ]

Description:

       The goal of xsokoban is to push all the round objects into
       the  score area of each level using the mouse or the arrow
       keys. The arrow keys move the player in the  corresponding
       direction, pushing an object if it is in the way and there
       is a clear space on the other side. The mouse buttons each
       have a distinct function.

       If the left mouse button is pressed on a clear square, the
       player will move to that location via the optimal path  if
       such a path exists; otherwise, the game will beep.

       If the middle button is pressed on an object that is adja-
       cent to the player, the object will be  pushed  one  step.
       If  the  middle mouse button is pressed on an empty space,
       the player will move the  closest  object  that  is  on  a
       straight  line  with the destination, such that the object
       can be pushed in that direction, and  the  player  is  not
       directly  between  the destination and the object.  Before
       pushing the object, the player is moved optimally to start
       the push.

       The  right  button  mouse undoes the last user action, and
       may be used any number of times.


       The rest of the functions are bound to the keyboard:

       ?       Display a help screen.

       q       Quit the game.

       s       Save and quit.

       u       Undo the last action. Same as right mouse  button.

       U       Restart a level.

       ^R      Redraw the screen.

       h,j,k,l Act just like the arrow keys, as in vi.

Options:

       -s      Show the scores

       -c      Create  a  new  score file (can be ran only by the
               owner of the game).

       -r      Restore a saved game.

       -nn     Start at level nn, provided that levels  below  it
               are completed.
