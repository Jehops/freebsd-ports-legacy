ATTENTION!

This is a first demo release of Hero of Allacrost, so don't expect
it to be much playable.

From the website:
"One thing we wish to mention right off the bat is: don't expect too
much from this first release. This release demonstrates the basic
components of map exploration, dialogue, battles, and character
management, but not much more. We are still missing a lot of artwork
and some important sections from the code that would have made this
release much more interactive and fun to play. What you will
experience is nothing but the foundation to which we will continue
to build the game off of, so don't be mistaken into thinking to
yourself "What, that's it?" when you play the demo for the first
time."
