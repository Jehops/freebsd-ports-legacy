Wargus is a Warcraft2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft2 with the 
Stratagus engine, as opposed to playing it with the original Warcraft2 
one. 

So unless you have a legal copy of Warcraft2 (original DOS Version required,
won't work with the battle.net edition) Wargus will be pretty useless to you, 
since it doesn't come with any graphics or sounds itself.

Since Wargus uses a different engine, not all things will work 100% the same 
as they did in the original Warcraft2. If you want the original unchanged 
Warcraft2 experience, you will still have to play the original.
