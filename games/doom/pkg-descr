This package contains all of the items you'll need to play DOOM
under Linux/FreeBSD, except for an X server if you want to use the X
version.  These files are for Linux DOOM version 1.8.

doom1.wad is the shareware DOOM wad for version 1.8.  If you have
DOOM or DOOM II for MS-DOS, then you can use those files instead.
