Wormux is a free game where funny animals fight on a 2D map with funny weapons.
Though currently under heavy development, it is already very playable, with
lots of weapons (Dynamite, Baseball Bat, Teleportation, etc.). For the moment,
you can not play against computer opponents. There are also lots of maps
available for your battling pleasure!  Wormux takes the genre to the next level,
with great customisation options leading to great gameplay. There is a wide
selection of teams, from the Aliens to the Chickens. Also, new battlefields can
be downloaded from the Internet, making strategy an important part of each
battle.
