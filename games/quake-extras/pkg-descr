This port installs various optional add-ons for games of Quake/QuakeWorld
and their spin-offs, collected all over the Internet.

To load a skybox, type "loadsky <skybox>", where "<skybox>" can be one of
"dmcw", "frozendust", and "snow2".

Note that the lits are only for FuhQuake and JoeQuake based clients.  Low
quality textures require a client with JPEG support.
