You're the world's deadliest soldier of fortune and your mission
is clear: survive. Track your prey across the globe in a series
of secret missions to take down a fanatical terrorist organization
before it takes you down. Maintain your cover as a covert warrior
in a startling variety of explosive missions ranging from underhanded
sabotage to stealthy assassination to full frontal assaults where
skill marks the difference between the hunter and the hunted.

Tear your way past enemy lines utilizing the world's most lethal
weaponry, including a sniper rifle, white phosphorous grenades, and
prototype microwave pulse guns. Real bullets do real damage: shoot
someone in the leg and he falls, writhing and grasping his wound;
shoot someone in the head and he falls down dead.

Based on the popular magazine of the same name, Soldier of Fortune
delivers the most realistic, covert-operative themed shooter experience
ever created. Like a blockbuster action-thriller, Soldier of Fortune
plunges you into the secret and deadly world of the modern-day
gun-for-hire via dozens of real-to-life missions spanning five continents
and innovative multiplayer modes.

You need an original game CD of Soldier of Fortune for Linux to use
this port.
