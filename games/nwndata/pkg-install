need the data files from one of two sources.  You can copy the files 
from an installation on a Windows machine to the 
/usr/compat/linux/usr/games/nwn/ directory on your machine, or you can 
use this port.  If you use this port, the game resources will be 
downloaded, however this is a very large file (over 1.2 gig in size). 
If you wish to use a Windows installation to do this, exit out of this 
port now.  NOTE:  If you are using a Windows installation, You should 
upgrade the installation to 1.29 before coping the files.  Are you sure 
you wish to proceed?" 14 70 || /usr/bin/false
