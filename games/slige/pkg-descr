SLIGE is a Win32 (i.e. Windows 95 or NT or 3.1 with Win32s) program
(compilable also for DOS and Linux) that produces brand-new levels for DOOM or
DOOM II. If you're tired of the levels and PWADs that you have, you can use
SLIGE to generate dozens or hundreds or thousands more. Some of them will
probably be pretty good, too (he said modestly).
