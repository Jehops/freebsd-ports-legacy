This game is installed as ${LOCALBASE}/bin/enigma (most likely
/usr/local/bin/enigma). If you run "enigma", you might end up in
/usr/bin/enigma (very simple file encryption). Also, read enigma(6)
instead of enigma(1).

Please note that this program used LUA4, not LUA5.

To play the game, please use "/usr/local/bin/enigma"
