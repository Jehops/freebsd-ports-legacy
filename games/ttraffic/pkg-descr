TTraffic is a Tcl/Tk version of the board game Rush Hour created by
Binary Arts Coporation. The goal is to remove the red car(s) out of the
grid through the slot on the right. To do this you have to slide the
other cars out of the way. TTraffic is inspired by GTraffic, the Gnome
version Rush Hour. TTraffic comes with about 15.000 puzzles ranging from
intermediate to expert. These puzzles were automatically created by the
program gtlevel.
