This package contains the files to run a FreeBSD Half-Life
Wizard Wars server under Linux emulation.

Wizard Wars is a new Half-Life add on (mod) that pits teams of
spell flinging wizards head to head in a magical maelstrom! Wizard
Wars lets you choose from eight different sorcerers, each with
varying strengths and special abilities, to battle other mages in
a variety of settings and objectives. From "Capture the Grail" to
all out Combo Chaos, in teams or with every magician on his own,
Wizard Wars allows great flexibility in the maps played, objectives
set (if any), and points earned. For who like the idea of fast-paced
all-out fighting with impressive and surprising magical staffs and
spells, Wizard Wars is sure to please.
