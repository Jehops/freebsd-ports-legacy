==============================================================================

If you have sound problems with SDL try setting the variable "s_sdlSpeed" to
"44100". It will be saved to the configuration file.

If you have sound problems with OpenAL recompile without it. Also the OPENAL
option causes the program to omit restoring gamma and mouse sensivity after
exitting.

The configuration files are saved to ~/.ioquake3 instead of ~/.q3a because
they have additional variables which would be removed if other engines
overwrite them. But you can safely copy the original directory to the new one
for the first time.

If you enabled CELLSHADING, check files/extra-patch-cellshading for variables.
