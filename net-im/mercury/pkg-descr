Mercury is a Java Based MSN client.

With Mercury you can do the same things as with your normal messenger:
    * Talk to friends
    * Change your nickname and status
    * Add a display picture (also know as avatar)
    * Send files through the MSN server (for people with a firewall etc..) or
	direct
    * Play games (Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 only at the moment)
    * Look through the webcam of your friends (webcam receiving only)

But Mercury has many extra functions that your normal messenger doesn't have.
