WARINING: 
If you use default self-sined certificates in wildfire 3.1.1 
version to support SSL, you need to necessarily regenerate them. 
After the installation please go to the "Server Certificates" menu 
and generate your certificates. After this you will be able to
connect through SSL again.

You can find the documentation files for this package in the 
directory %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wildfire.

To enable wildfire startup script please add wildfire_enable="YES" 
in your rc.conf
