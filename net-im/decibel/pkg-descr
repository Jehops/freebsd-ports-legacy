Decibel is a realtime communications framework, integrating services
like CTI (Computer Telephone Integration), VoIP (Voice over IP), text
based chat and instant messaging.
Desktop users find in Decibel one central place to manage all their
realtime communication settings and can easily configure and change responses
to communication requests.
By providing a simple, DBus-based API to the services like communication
accountmanagement, connection to contacts, etc. Decibel reduces the
complexity and effort of accessing realtime communication technologies in
applications. This allows for integration of realtime communication
technologies into applications that are not focused on communication.
