    <config xmlns="jabber:config:yahoo">

  <!-- This is the name that will appear when the transport is browsed or
  discovered.  REQUIRED -->
      <vCard>
        <NAME>Yahoo! IM Gateway</NAME>
      </vCard>

  <!-- This is the text that is presented to the user when they register with

    </config>
  </service>

Add this section to the browse area of the jsm to advertise it to
your users (around line 382 of the sample config):
