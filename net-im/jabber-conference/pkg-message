NOTE: if you want this service to be accessible from other servers,
 change any 'conference.localhost' or 'private.localhost' listed below
 to a fully qualified domain name!  Please make sure that your directives
 are _NOT_ in an XML comment: there are many multi-line comments.

Conference can be configured as a private conferencing server (no browse,
all rooms locked up).  Add the following to make a private conferencing
server (around line 446 in the sample configuration file):

  <service id='private.localhost'>
    <load><conference>${PREFIX}/lib/jabber/conference.so</conference></load>
    <conference xmlns="jabberd:config:conference">
      <private/>
      <history>30</history>
      <vCard>
        <FN>Private Conferences</FN>
        <DESC>This service is for private conferencing rooms.</DESC>
        <URL>http://foo.bar/</URL>
      </vCard>
      <notice>
        <join> has become available</join>
        <leave> has left</leave>
        <rename> is now known as </rename>
      </notice>
    </conference>
  </service>

Add this section to the browse area of the jsm service to advertise it
to your users (around line 246 of the sample config file):

    <conference type="private" jid="private.localhost" name="Private Conferencing"/>


Conference can ALSO be configured as a public chatroom server (add this
around line 446 in the sample config file):

(NOTE: don't forget to change the secret and note that this is transmitted
  in plain text.)

  <service id='conference.localhost'>
    <load><conference>${PREFIX}/lib/jabber/conference.so</conference></load>
    <conference xmlns="jabber:config:conference">
      <public/>
      <vCard>
        <FN>Public Chatrooms</FN>
        <DESC>This service is for public chatrooms.</DESC>
        <URL>http://foo.bar/</URL>
      </vCard>
      <history>20</history>
      <notice>
        <join> has become available</join>
        <leave> has left</leave>

      </room>
      <room jid="admin@conference.localhost">

        <secret>con0r</secret>
        <notice>

          <leave> gets lost</leave>
          <rename> feels it is more important to be known as </rename>
        </notice>
