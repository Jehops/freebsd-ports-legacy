You can connect to ICQ using this transport, however you cannot
retrieve ICQ away status messages or user information, nor search for
users. A simple SMS sending hack is included, but for now responses do
not come through and no SMS sending confirmation is sent.  For SMS,
send "SEND-SMS:number:text" to any ICQ user, for example
"SEND-SMS:+4917012345:Test".

To activate aim-transport, you will need to edit your jabber.xml to
tell jabberd to load this file, and let clients be aware of it's
availability.  In the browse section of the jsm service you need to
add (uncomment out this block around line 248 of the sample
configuration):

	<!--
	 * Don't forget to change aim.localhost to your hostname
	 * if you want to make this publicly available.
	-->
	<service type="aim" jid="aim.localhost" name="AIM Transport">
	  <ns>jabber:iq:gateway</ns>
	  <ns>jabber:iq:register</ns>
	</service>

Next you need to add the lines to load in the transport and it's
configuration options.  Please note that the following is
substantially different than what comes in the sample config
file. (near line 457):

  <!--
   * Don't forget to change aim.localhost to your hostname
   * if you want to make this publicly available.
  -->
  <service id='aim.localhost'>
    <load><aim_transport>${PREFIX}/lib/jabber/aimtrans.so</aim_transport></load>

    <aimtrans xmlns='jabber:config:aimtrans'>
      <!--
        * This is the path to the aim binary neede by libfain for
        * for providing access to AIM's servers
      -->
      <aimbinarydir>/path/to/aim_install</aimbinarydir>
      <vCard>
        <FN>AIM Transport</FN>
        <DESC>An AIM Transport!</DESC>
        <URL>http://foo.bar/</URL>
      </vCard>
      
    </aimtrans>
  </service>

The most interesting of these is the <aimbinarydir/> flag.  For
aimtransport to be able to work you need a valid directory from AIM
version 3.5.1670.  It has to be that version.  I would suggest
searching on Google.  For legal reasons I can not distribute this
file.

The installer version that works for me is this with md5sum:

04eba0bd0ea5fe1756612e14663093aa  /win/Install_AIM_3.5.1670.exe

After these changes everything should be running smoothly.
