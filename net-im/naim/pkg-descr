naim is a console client for AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), AOL I Seek You
(ICQ), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and The lily CMC.

It includes unique features like zero-configuration peer to peer encryption,
automatic message queueing, and incoming message modification (to correct
common spelling mistakes and expand common abbreviations; see /help filter).

It also includes powerful dynamic module support, allowing developers to
modify all major aspects of naim's behavior.

When combined with GNU Screen, naim is great to use as a chat client as
well as an answering machine. Individual users can detach, log out, pack
up and go home, then log back in from anywhere on the Internet to resume
their naim session.
