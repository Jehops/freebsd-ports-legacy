This GPLed project is the approach to provide a good gtk2
interface to the popular licq program. There were other
efforts, but they are discontinued or just outdated. The
reason for creating this plugin is, regarding the original
qt-gui for licq, on the one hand a question of the integration
of the user interface. In my eyes the qt-gui lacks a certain
usability and good look in some points, also it does not really
integrate with gtk desktops. On the other hand it is a question
of qt itself. I don't want to let all the big qt libs be shoveled
into the memory just for using one program, also I basically
like gtk-2 more. There are other icq clients for gtk, but there
is none that has the completeness of Licq.
