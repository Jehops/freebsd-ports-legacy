The Jabber transport (jserver) is a daemon for Jabber clients to connect
and communicate with. It only handles native Jabber protocol.

After editing $PREFIX/etc/jserver.xml, the server can be started by
rc.d script.

Complete information about configuration can be found in the Jabber Server
mini-HOWTO at http://docs.jabber.org/.
