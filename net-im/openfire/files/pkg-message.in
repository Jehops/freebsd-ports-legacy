NOTE: 
Due to the name change the product releases will work as follows:

o  3.2.x series: these releases will continue to use the Wildfire name so
   that critical bug fixes can be delivered with minimal hassle to existing
   users.

o  3.3.x series: starting with 3.3.0, the server is called Openfire. 
   There will be a small amount of upgrade pain associated with this release
   since configuration files like wildfire.xml will now be openfire.xml, etc.

If you use default self-sined certificates in wildfire 3.1.1 version to
