NOTE: 
Due to the name change the product releases will work as follows:

o  3.2.x series: these releases will continue to use the Wildfire name so
   that critical bug fixes can be delivered with minimal hassle to existing
   users. (/usr/ports/net-im/wildfire)

o  3.3.x series: starting with 3.3.0, the server is called Openfire. 
   There will be a small amount of upgrade pain associated with this release
   since configuration files like wildfire.xml will now be openfire.xml, etc.
   (/usr/ports/net-im/openfire)

WARNING:
===========================================================================
This is an upgrade procedure from wildfire 3.2.4 to openfire 3.3.0:

1) Stop the wildfire server if it still running.
2) Back up setup.
3) Go to %%PREFIX%%/etc/openfire and copy configuration from old setup
   a) Copy wildfire.xml and rename it to openfire.xml.
   b) Search for org.jivesoftware.wildfire. and replace with
      org.jivesoftware.openfire. in openfire.xml
   c) Change owner for configurations files:
      chown -R openfire:openfire %%PREFIX%%/etc/openfire
4) If using embedded database:
   a) Copy and rename files:
      /var/db/wildfire/wildfire* files to /var/db/openfire/openfire*
   b) Change owner for the database files:
      chown -R openfire:openfire /var/db/openfire
5) Copy old certificates from resources/security directory to same 
   location in openfire. If you are using self-signed certificates then 
   regenerate them after start up.
