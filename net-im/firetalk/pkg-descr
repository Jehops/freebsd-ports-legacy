FireTalk is a library designed to make writing applications for online
chat and instant messenging easier. It was originally written as a
replacement for libfaim. It currently supports AIM via the TOC
protocol, but IRC and ICQ support should be implemented within the
near future. The package also includes a simple AIM client that has
many of the same command names as functions in the library. This
allows developers to examine the behavior of the library closely while
writing their own code.
