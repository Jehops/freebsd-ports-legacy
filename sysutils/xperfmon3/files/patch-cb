  		program will compile correctly under X11R5 and/or Motif.
  
  1-11-94		Revised by Roger Smith, Sterling Software @NASA-Ames Research Center,
! 		rsmith@proteus.arc.nasa.gov. 
  		Changed name to "xperfmon++".
  		Replaced Perfmon widget with a highly modified StripChart widget. Charts
  		now smooth scroll, scales update immediately, and there is a scrolling timestamp

  1-25-94		Completed port to DEC-Ultrix by Roger Smith, Sterling Software @ NASA-Ames
  		Research Center, rsmith@proteus.arc.nasa.gov. Imake will build for correct
  		O/S if x11r5 is fully installed in all the right places.

+ 3-15-95		Completely new port of systemdependent file (bsd_system.c) for FreeBSD-2.X
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Rostock, Germany.
+ 		E-Mail: <lars.koeller@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de>
+ 
+ 8-16-95		Quick and dirty workaround of -geometry option bug.
+ 		But there are still some side effects when changing the geometry.
+ 		Fix memory leak in bsd_system.c
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Rostock, Germany.
+ 		E-Mail: <lars.koeller@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de>
+ 
+ 30-10-95	Change 'Free Mem' graph to 'Free Swap' cause the FreeBSD memory system
+ 		tries to minimize the free unused amount of memory.
+ 		Include basic support for FreeBSD > 2.1.
+ 		Number of interrupts now independent from 'Update Intervall'
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Rostock, Germany.
+ 		E-Mail: <Lars_Koeller@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de>
+ 
+ 11-12-95        Fix -geometry bug! Now there is only a MIN_WIDTH of 185 pixels, and the
+ 		MIN_HEIGTH is calculates dynamically depending on the number of active
+ 		graphs.	FreeBSD-2.X only:
+ 		Change 'Free  Swap' graph from absolut into percent values.
+ 		All graphs shoud be independent of the 'Update Intervall'.
+ 		Modify graph labels and add unit of each graph.
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Rostock, Germany.

+ 
+ 5-4-96		Fix some event problems that consumes a lot of cpu power after resizing
+ 		(mwm) or restart of an window manager. Make xperfmon compile with
+ 		FreeBSD-current (2.2, changes in get_swapspace)
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Rostock, Germany.

+ 4-30-98		Add System Load graph
+ 		Add CPU Nice and Interrupt graph
+ 		Compiles on FreeBSD-2.2.X and 3.X
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Bielefeld, Germany.
+ 		E-Mail: Lars.Koeller@Uni-Bielefeld.DE
+ 
+ 10-10-98	Add graphs for: disk/tape/cdrom transfers, disktape/cdrom io in MB/s,
+                                 NFS client and server cache hits/misses
+ 		Complete rewrite of freebsd_system.c!
+ 		Graphs now scales and displays floating point values correctly
+ 		Compiles on FreeBSD-3.X
+ 		by Lars Köller @University of Bielefeld, Germany.
+ 		E-Mail: Lars.Koeller@Uni-Bielefeld.DE
+ 
+ 04-10-01	Correct several bugs in V3.0:
+ 		Calc etime correct for multi CPU machines, show disk stats for new
+ 		"ad" disk devices, count number of network in/out packets correctly,
+ 		get free swapspace only every 10 intervals to limit CPU usage.
+ 		Compiles on FreeBSD-3.X/4.X
+                 by Lars Köller @University of Bielefeld, Germany.
