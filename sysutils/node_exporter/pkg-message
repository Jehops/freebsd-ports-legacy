  message: <<EOM
Text collector examples have been moved to a new repository at
https://github.com/prometheus-community/node-exporter-textfile-collector-scripts.

The netdev collector CLI argument `--collector.netdev.ignored-devices` was
renamed to `--collector.netdev.device-blacklist`.

Additional label `mountaddr` added to NFS device metrics to distinguish mounts
from the same URL, but different IP addresses.

Metrics `node_cpu_scaling_frequency_min_hrts` and
`node_cpu_scaling_frequency_max_hrts` of the cpufreq collector were renamed to
`node_cpu_scaling_frequency_min_hertz` and
`node_cpu_scaling_frequency_max_hertz`.

Collectors that are enabled, but are unable to find data to collect, now return
`0` for `node_scrape_collector_success`.

  message: <<EOM
If upgrading from a version of node_exporter <0.15.0 you'll need to update any
custom command line flags that you may have set as it now requires a
double-dash (--flag) instead of a single dash (-flag).
The collector flags in 0.15.0 have now been replaced with individual boolean
flags and the -collector.procfs` and -collector.sysfs` flags have been renamed
to --path.procfs and --path.sysfs respectively.
