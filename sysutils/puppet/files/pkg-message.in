To enable puppetd and/or puppetmasterd, add:

puppetd_enable="YES"
puppetmasterd_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf

Individual config files such as %%PREFIX%%/etc/puppetmasterd.conf are
deprecated. Use a single file, %%PREFIX%%/etc/puppet/puppet.conf.

Now the default PID directory is %%PUPPET_RUNDIR%%.
