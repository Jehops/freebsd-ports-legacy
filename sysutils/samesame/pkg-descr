These applications find identical / duplicate files and hard- or symlink
them to save space. This port was inspired by the application samefile
written by Jens Schweikhardt. It has a own version of samefile that is
noticeable faster and is able to process very large file list.

This port contains the applications: samefile, samelink and samearchive.
The latter does the same as samefile but for file-based archives. The
port also contains a version that uses just 10% of the resources compared
to samearchive. The application samelink (hard) links files for you.

Typical usage would be:

   find / | samefile -i | samelink

This would search for identical files and clean up wasted disk space by
linking them together. Add the option -n after samelink for a dry-run.
