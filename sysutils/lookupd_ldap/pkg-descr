lookupd_ldap is the LDAP plugin for the lookupd daemon.
It is, basically, a slightly changed PADL.com's nss_ldap. The
most important changes are:
	1) It's a bit smaller and is only for FreeBSD
	2) It's adapted to the lookupd threaded model

For the information about configuring lookupd-ldap see
the nss_ldap website (we use the same configuration
file: /usr/local/etc/nss_ldap.conf).
