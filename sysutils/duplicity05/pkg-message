* The following two backends are supported by duplicity itself,         *
* but will require manual installation of their respective dependencies *
* because they are not yet available in the ports tree:                 *
*                                                                       *
*   - The CloudFiles backend (for RackSpace's CloudFiles).              *
*   - The tahoe backend for Tahoe-LAFS.                                 *
*                                                                       *
* Please refer to upstream duplicity documentation for information on   *
