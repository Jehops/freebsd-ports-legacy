Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes an
d
uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses
librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record t
he
parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicit
y uses
GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spyi
ng
and/or modification by the server.
