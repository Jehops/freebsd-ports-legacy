A simple CPU meter for the KDE Kicker which displays percent usage,
with support for SMP and separate user/system loads. It will show
the CPU usage in form of one or two configurable diagrams. There are
settings for colors and some different styles. Note that it isn't
the real system load that's shown, but the percent used of the total
CPU power, which is calculated from the number of CPU ticks.
