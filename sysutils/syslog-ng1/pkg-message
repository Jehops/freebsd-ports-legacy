syslog-ng is now installed!  To replace FreeBSD's standard syslogd
(/usr/sbin/syslogd), complete these steps:

1. Create a configuration file named __PREFIX__/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
   (a sample named syslog-ng.conf.sample has been included)

2. Configure syslog-ng to start automatically by creating a startup script
   in __PREFIX__/etc/rc.d.  (a sample named syslog-ng.sh.sample has been
   included)

3. Prevent the standard FreeBSD syslogd from starting automatically by
   adding a line to the end of your /etc/rc.conf file that reads:

     syslogd_enable="NO"
 
4. Reboot.
