syslog-ng is now installed!  To replace FreeBSD's standard syslogd
(/usr/sbin/syslogd), complete these steps:

1. Create a configuration file named __PREFIX__/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
   (a sample named syslog-ng.conf.sample has been included)

2. If you are using FreeBSD 4.4 or later, add these lines to your /etc/rc.conf:

     syslogd_program="__PREFIX__/sbin/syslog-ng"
     syslogd_flags=""

3. If you are using FreeBSD 4.3 or earlier, follow these steps:

   a. Configure syslog-ng to start automatically by creating a startup script
      in __PREFIX__/etc/rc.d.  (a sample named syslog-ng.sh.sample has been
      included)

   b. Prevent the standard FreeBSD syslogd from starting automatically by
      adding a line to the end of your /etc/rc.conf file that reads:

        syslogd_enable="NO"
 
4. Shut down the standard FreeBSD syslogd:

     kill `cat /var/run/syslog.pid`

5. Start syslog-ng:

     __PREFIX__/sbin/syslog-ng
