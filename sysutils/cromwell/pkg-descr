Cromwell is a 100% open source BIOS for the Microsoft Xbox. Its original intent
is to boot Linux on the Xbox, but later versions can boot FreeBSD as well.

As there have been no recent releases, this version was checked out of the
SourceForge xbox-linux CVS. An patch is provided to allow Cromwell to load
kernels from UFS partitions.
