log_analysis is a log file analysis engine that extracts relevant
data for any of the recognized log messages and produces a summary
that is much easier to read. It can be configured to recognize
entirely new log types. log_analysis natively understands about
100 different kinds of syslog messages, as well as wtmp messages.
