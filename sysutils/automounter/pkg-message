Please restart the devd(8) daemon after install, especially when updating from
a previous version of automounter.

Note that stopping devd often leaves a stale PID file behind, which then
blocks restarting it. Use a more roundabout way of restarting the service:
	service devd stop; rm /var/run/devd.pid; service devd start
