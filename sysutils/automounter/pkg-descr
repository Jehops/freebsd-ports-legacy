A script to dynamically configure amd and populate /media with appropriate
links, when USB mass storage devices appear. It relies on geom labels, hence
it only works for properly labeled devices.

It also allows to automatically attach geli encrypted devices and images with
keys polled from file systems it makes mountable.
