===================================

To reconfigure usermin you should
run the following command as root:

  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/usermin/setup.sh

You won't have to perform this step
after every usermin upgrade.

Since 1.080_2, to run usermin from
startup, add usermin_enable="YES"
in your /etc/rc.conf.
