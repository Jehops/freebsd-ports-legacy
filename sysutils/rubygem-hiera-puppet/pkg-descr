Hiera-puppet is a data backend for Hiera that queries the internal
Puppet scope for data. The data structure and approach is heavily
based on work by Nigel Kersten but made more configurable and with
full hierarchy.

It also includes a Puppet function that works like extlookup() but
uses the Hiera backends.
