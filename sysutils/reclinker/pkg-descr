reclinker is a recursive symlinking utility. It mirrors a hierarchy of
files by means of symlinks. It's similar to GNU Stow, however:
* written in pure C (no dependencies, fast)
* free of forced, confusing package management terminology (like stow
  dir, target dir, package)
* supports both absolut and relative linking
* supports linking into existing hierarchies, handles properly already
  existing directory symlinks in the target hierarchy (like /usr/man ->
  share/man)
* supports access control (set ownership/mode of created
  links/directories, filter processed files based on ownership/mode
  requirements)
