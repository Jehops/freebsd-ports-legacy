.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a simple tool for managing your ports.
It uses no external database to track what you
have installed,
rather it uses the existing ports infrastructure,
including what is located in
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
The focus of this tool is to keep the dependency
tracking information for your ports up to date,
which allows you to update a specific port without
having to update all of the ports
.Dq above
it.
In the rare case where you do need to recompile
ports which depend on a port you are updating,
the -r option exists to accomplish this.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl C
Prevents 'make clean' being run in port directory
.It Fl a
check all ports, update as necessary
.It Fl n
do not launch child process to update dependencies
.It Fl v
verbose output
.It Fl f
always rebuild ports (overrides -i)
.It Fl i
interactive update mode
.It Fl D
prevents cleaning of distfiles
.It Fl d
always clean distfiles
.It Fl p Ar port directory in /usr/ports
Specify the full path to a port directory
.It Fl m Ar arguments for make
any arguments to supply to
.Xr make 1
.It Fl r Ar name/glob of port in /var/db/pkg
rebuild port, and all ports that depend on it
.It Fl h
display help file
.It Fl l
list all installed ports by category
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa $HOME/.portmaster.rc" -compact
.It Pa /etc/portmaster.rc
.It Pa $HOME/.portmaster.rc
Optional system and user configuration files.
The variables set in the script's getopts routine
can be specified in these files to enable those options.
