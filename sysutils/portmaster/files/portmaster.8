.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a simple tool for managing your ports.
It uses no external database to track what you
have installed.
Rather it uses the existing ports infrastructure,
including what is located in
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
The focus of this tool is to keep the dependency
tracking information for your ports up to date,
which allows you to update a specific port without
having to update all of the ports
.Dq above
it.
In the rare case where you do need to recompile
ports which depend on a port you are updating,
the
.Fl r
option exists to accomplish this.
.Pp
By default
.Nm
will first recurse through the port to update,
and all of its dependencies (if any) to handle
any port OPTIONS via the 'make config' interface.
It will then start building all ports that need
updating.
While recursing through dependencies,
a 'make checksum' process will be launched
in the background to either verify that the
correct distfiles are available,
or start downloading the new ones.
If you stop
.Nm
with ^C, an attempt will be made to kill off all
the child processes started for this purpose.
.Pp
If the recursion through the ports for 'make
config' does not find a port that needs updating,
the dependency check step will be skipped prior
to building the port specified on the command line.
In addition to this optimization,
information about up-to-date dependencies,
choices made on which ports to build for
interactive mode,
and ports already visited for 'make config' are
all cached to enhance performance and prevent
duplicated efforts.
.Pp
While recursing through the dependencies,
if a port is marked IS_INTERACTIVE this will
be flagged.
In the absence of this notification,
under normal circumstances the only user interaction
required after the port starts building is to answer
questions about the deletion of stale distfiles.
This can be eliminated with the
.Fl d
option.
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl C
prevents 'make clean' being run in port directory
.It Fl G
prevents the recursive 'make config'
.It Fl b
create a backup package of the installed port (if any)
.It Fl g
create a package of the new port
.It Fl n
do not actually perform any updates
.It Fl v
verbose output
.It Fl u
unattended mode, accepts defaults for all
.Nm
dialogues
.It Fl f
always rebuild ports (overrides -i)
.It Fl i
interactive update mode
.It Fl D
prevents cleaning of distfiles
.It Fl d
always clean distfiles
.It Fl m Ar arguments for make
any arguments to supply to
.Xr make 1
.It Fl p Ar port directory in /usr/ports
Specify the full path to a port directory
.It Fl o Ar <new port dir in /usr/ports> <installed port>
Replace the installed port with a port from a different origin
.It Fl r Ar name/glob of port in /var/db/pkg
rebuild port, and all ports that depend on it
.It Fl a
check all ports, update as necessary
.It Fl l
list all installed ports by category
.It Fl L
list all installed ports by category, and search for updates
.It Fl e Ar name of port directory in /var/db/pkg
Expunge port using
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
and optionally removing all distfiles.
Calls
.Fl s
mode after it is done expunging in case removing
the port causes a dependency to no longer be
necessary.
.It Fl s
clean out stale ports that used to be depended on
.It Fl h
display help file
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa $HOME/.portmasterrc" -compact
.It Pa /etc/portmaster.rc
.It Pa $HOME/.portmasterrc
Optional system and user configuration files.
The variables set in the script's getopts routine
can be specified in these files to enable those options.
.It Pa /var/db/pkg/*/+IGNOREME
If this file exists,
.Nm
will ignore this port for the purpose of dependency
updates.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of a typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl "portmaster fooport-1.23"
.Dl "portmaster fooport"
.Dl "portmaster -p /usr/ports/foo/fooport"
.Dl "portmaster foo/fooport"
.Dl "portmaster -r fooport-1.23"
.Dl "portmaster -o emulators/linux_base-fc4 linux_base-8-8.0_15"
.Pp
.Dl "portmaster -L | grep -B1 '	'"
Print only the ports that have available updates.
(Note that the whitespace between single quotes is a tab.)
