This script provides a simple way to manage your ports.  It uses the existing
ports infrastructure to track dependencies, and to keep those dependencies
up to date.

Because portmaster is written in /bin/sh, it needs no other languages installed.

Portmaster has the following features:
  * User can specify the port to upgrade (or install) either by directory
    in /usr/ports (whether the port is already installed or not), or by
    directory in /var/db/pkg
  * Updates and repairs (as needed) entries for dependencies in both +CONTENTS
    and +REQUIRED_BY files for both the port that is being updated, and any
    ports that depend on it
  * Runs make config
  * Recursively checks and upgrades (or installs) all dependencies
  * User can force upgrades of all dependent ports
  * Runs make clean before starting the build (can be disabled)
  * Offers the user the opportunity to delete stale distfiles
  * Supports /usr/ports/MOVED
  * Supports non-default settings of PORTSDIR and PKG_DBDIR
  * Interactive update mode (prompts for each update)
  * Option to rebuild port, and ports that depend on it
