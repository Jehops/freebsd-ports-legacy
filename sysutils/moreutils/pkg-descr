moreutils is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to
write thirty years ago.

So far, it includes the following utilities:
- chronic: run a command quietly, unless it fails
- combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
- ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
- isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
- lckdo: execute a program with a lock held
- mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
- pee: tee standard input to pipes
- sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
- ts: timestamp standard input
- vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
- vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
- zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command

The Linux-specific 'ifdata' utility is not included in this FreeBSD port.
