.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmispipe\fR pipes two commands
together like the shell does, but unlike piping in the
shell, which returns the exit status of the last command;
when using mispipe, the exit status of the first command
is returned.
.PP
Note that some shells, notably \fBbash\fR,
do offer a pipefail option, however, that option does not
behave the same since it makes a failure of any command in
the pipeline be returned, not just the exit status of the
first.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The exit status of the first command. If the process
terminated abnormally (due to a signal), 128 will be added
to its exit status.
