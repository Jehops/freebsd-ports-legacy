.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsponge\fR reads standard input and
writes it out to the specified file. Unlike a shell
redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before
opening the output file. This allows constructing
pipelines that read from and write to
the same file.
.PP
It also creates the output file
atomically by renaming a temp file into place,
and preserves the permissions of the output file
if it already exists.
If the output file is a special file or symlink,
the data will be written to it.
.PP
If no output file is specified, sponge outputs to
stdout.
