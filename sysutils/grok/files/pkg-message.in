============================================================
You'll have to edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/grok.conf to your
liking.  Examples and documentation are available at
grok(1) and at:

http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/grok/

Also, modifications to syslog.conf may be necessary.
Usually "user.info /var/log/messages" is enough.
