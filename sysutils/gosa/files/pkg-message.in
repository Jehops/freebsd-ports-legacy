Now GOsa is installed. To use it you should:

1. Include settings for GOsa in your webserver's config. Like this:

       Alias /gosa %%WWWDIR%%/html

   Restart your webserver.

2. Do your first GOsa dry run without configuration:

       http[s]://your-server/gosa/setup.php

    GOsa setup will perform some basic system checks about general
    prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a basic
    gosa.conf to save in %%PREFIX%%/etc/gosa. Follow the instructions
    until you're able to log in.
