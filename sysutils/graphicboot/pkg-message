WARNING: This port port will start X during the startup.
Before adding the graphboot="YES" line to your rc.conf
file please test the port by running it in multi-user
mode.  If you need to make any changes to the xorg.conf
file, please remember to leave the resolution at 640x480.

Please note that if you are using XDM or another display
manager for graphical logon, please edit its startup
script by adding the line at the beginning:

	sendgbmsg -e

This will cause the graphicboot to end before the
display manager starts.

To use graphicboot, simply add the line to your rc.conf
file:

	graphicboot="YES"
