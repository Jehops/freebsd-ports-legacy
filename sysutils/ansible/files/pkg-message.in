To use Ansible, you need at least a host database.
If you installed examples, you will have a sample
host database and a sample configuration file: 

  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/hosts
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/ansible.cfg

Ansible 1.3.0+, includes "accelerate" mode, which is
faster and has fewer dependencies than "fireball" mode.
To use it, install security/py-keyczar.
