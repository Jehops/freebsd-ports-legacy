To use ansible, you need at least a host database.
You can find a sample host database file in

  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/hosts

You can also find a sample configuration file in

  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/ansible.cfg

Ansible 1.3.0, includes "accelerate" mode, which is
faster and has fewer dependencies than "fireball" mode.
To use it, install security/py-keyczar.
