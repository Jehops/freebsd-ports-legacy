**************************************************
NOTE IF you install a apcupsd server:

Change to /dev and create a softlink to usv from
the serial line the USV is connected to, e.g.

  cd /dev
  ln -s cuaa1 usv

Read the manual to do site specific configuration
assigenments! Especially have a detailed look into
the chapter describing the shutdown procedure.

Sample files are installed in ${PREFIX}/etc/apcupsd:

  apcupsd.conf.sample, apcupsd.conf.net-master.sample
  apcupsd.conf.net-slave.sample, hosts.conf.sample
  multimon.conf.sample and cgi/apcupsd.css.sample

These files must be copied and/or configured for a
proper working apcupsd. Look into the manual!
