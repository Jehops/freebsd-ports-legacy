NOTE IF you install a apcupsd server:

Change to /dev and create a softlink to e.g. ups from the serial line
the USV is connected to, e.g.

  cd /dev
  ln -s cuaa1 ups

Read the manual

  ${PREFIX}/share/doc/apcupsd/manual.pdf

to do site specific configuration assigenments! Especially have a
detailed look into the chapter describing the shutdown procedure.

Sample files are installed in ${PREFIX}/etc/apcupsd. These files
must be copied and/or configured for a proper working apcupsd.
You need to modify ${PREFIX}/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf as follows:

  For serial cable: DEVICE /dev/ups (or /dev/cuaaX)
  For USB cable: DEVICE (yes, leave it blank after DEVICE)

NOTE that for USB cable you must comment out the line

  device         uhid            # "Human Interface Devices"

in your kernel configuration file and recompile the kernel.
Your keyboard and mouse will still work.

WARNING USB support on FreeBSD is still considered BETA!
