[from README]
LCDproc is a client/server suite including drivers for all kinds
of nifty LCD devices. The server works with different display sizes
and supports several serial devices: Matrix Orbital, Crystal Fontz,
Bayrad, LB216, LCDM001 (kernelconcepts.de), Wirz-SLI and PIC-an-LCD;
and some devices connected to the parallel port: HD44780, STV5730,
T6963, SED1520 and SED1330. Various clients are available that
display things like CPU load, system load, memory usage, uptime,
and a lot more.

LCDproc also supports key or remote control input for controlling
the clients.

The client and the server use a TCP connection to communicate, so
it is possible to have a client on a box in Sweden showing its stats
on a LCD display in the United States.
