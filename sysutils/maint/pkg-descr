  Maint is a system maintenance script wrapper package written in Python and CSH
to handle common tasks, such as updating ports and source trees, building the
OS, readmes, cleaning ports and source trees, and other common tasks.  Maint
is very modular and easy to extend and/or add new functions to. Maint also
includes a batch facility to allow creating batch files for the most often
done or special sequences of commands - and is cronable.

  A fully automatic system build facility is in the works, which will include
building the OS and kernel, as well as software from the ports collection.
This will make duplicating or restoring a system setup extremely easy.
