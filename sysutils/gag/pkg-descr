GAG (initials, in spanish, of Graphical Boot Manager) is a Boot Manager
program. It's loaded when the computer is turned on and allows you to choose
the operating system you want to use. Its main features are:

- Allows boot of up to 9 different operating systems.
- It can boot operating systems installed in primary and extended partitions
  on any available hard disk.
- Can be installed from nearly all operating systems.
- GAG doesn't need its own partition. It installs itself in the first track of
  the hard disk, wich is reserved for these kinds of programs. It can also be
  instaled on a floppy disk, without using the hard disk.
- It has a timer to boot a default operating system (selectable by the user).
- The configuration menu can be protected with a password.
- The program works in graphic mode (>=VGA card), and has a lot of icons.
- Hides the primary partitions which allows the user to have instaled more
  than one DOS and/or Windows in the same hard disk.
- Allows a password to be put on each operating system, restricting access.
- Allows the boot manager text to be translated to all languages.
- Can exchange disk drives, allowing disk operating systems such as MS-DOS.
- Has the SafeBoot system, allowing to boot if GAG is accidentally overwrited.
- Supports a great variety of keyboards (QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ and DVORAK).
- Fully support for hard disks up to 4 terabytes (4096 gigabytes).
