This is the initial release of the FreeBSD port for osquery.

We aren't anywhere near 100% feature parity when compared to
Linux, however, we are actively working to get there.

osqueryd does not yet have the required functionality to run,
however, osqueryi (the interactive CLI version) can perform
basic tasks.
