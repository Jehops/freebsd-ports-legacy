iocage is a zero dependency drop in jail/container manager
amalgamating some of the best features and technologies
FreeBSD operating system has to offer.

It is geared for ease of use with a simple and easy to
understand command syntax.

This version of iocage is now deprecated in favor of
Python based version in sysutils/py-iocage.
