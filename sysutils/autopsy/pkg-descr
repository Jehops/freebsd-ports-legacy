The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to the command line
digital forensic analysis tools in The Sleuth Kit.  Together, The Sleuth Kit
and Autopsy provide many of the same features as commercial digital
forensics tools for the analysis of Windows and UNIX file systems (NTFS,
FAT, FFS, EXT2FS, and EXT3FS).

The Sleuth Kit and Autopsy are both Open Source and run on UNIX platforms.
As Autopsy is HTML-based, the investigator can connect to the Autopsy
server from any platform using an HTML browser.  Autopsy provides
a "File Manager"-like interface and shows details about deleted data
and file system structures.
