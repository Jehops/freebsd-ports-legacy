lmmon

This program displays information gathered from a motherboard
power management controller (e.g. LM78/79).  Displayed values
include fan speeds, motherboard temperature, and various
voltages.  By default it cycles once per second using a curses-
based display.

Currently, the /dev/smb0 interface is only supported in FreeBSD
4.0; however, the /dev/io interface may work with many
motherboards in FreeBSD 3.x and some non-LM78/79 motherboards.
