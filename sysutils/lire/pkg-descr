Lire, the french word for `to read', is a toolset of logfile analysers.

The Lire package is targeted at automatically generating useful
reports from raw log files from various services. Currently, Lire
can generate reports for a variety of email, web, dns, ftp, print
servers and firewalls, and supports multiple output formats.

Lire is built around the concept of a superservice. A superservice
is a class of applications which share the same reports. Lire
supports 6 superservices: dns, email, firewall, ftp, print and www.
This means that log files for all supported email servers (service
in Lire's parlance) will get similar reports. This is important for
heterogeneous environments where you could have e.g. Sendmail and
Postfix mail servers running. You will get similar reports which
you can compare.

Notes:
- PDF output can be enabled if you follow the instructions coming
  with "make pdf"
- Excel output only works if you have Perl 5.6.1
