With the change to a new rc system in FreeBSD 5.x, common routines for
starting, stopping, and restarting daemons was placed into /etc/rc.subr.
this makes it easier to write new startup/shutdown scripts and to have
them ordered correctly with rcorder.

While FreeBSD < 5.x won't be able to take advantage of rcorder.  We can
take advantage of the simplified startup/shutdown scripts by using rc.subr.
