    This is a kernel 'config' wrapper for the simple people, based off the
    'doconfig' command in Digital Unix.  It is actually composed of two
    commands written in perl4: doconfig and autokernconf.  doconfig calls
    autokernconf if no config file is specified--in the future it is intended
    that autokernconf can be crufted up to chew on the output of dmesg and
    other sources to give a somewhat intelligently defaulted kernel config
    template, based off the GENERIC template.  For now it just copies GENERIC
    and changes ident as appropriate.
