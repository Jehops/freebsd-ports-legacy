  To use LDAP account manager, you have to install
  and set up Samba 3.x schemas.
  Like this :
     include       %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
     include       %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
     include       %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
     include       %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
     include       %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/schema/samba.schema
