--------------------- Networker Configuration Information --------------------

The networker clients need to have a Networker server somewhere on
the network that will agree to take these clients on. Please consult
Networker documentation from Legato about this.

As of NetWorker Release 5.5, the more stringent client licencing
is now being enforced.  This means that Linux and *BSD clients that
have identified themselves to the server as being such are now part
of the 'Unix Workstation' group of clients. Legato requires some
additional licences installed on the server in addition to normal
client resource limits. You have to purchase this from Legato if
you haven't already.

This version of the client places all binaries in the director

	ROOTDIR/nsr/bin

Adjust your PATH environment variable to reflect this.

Also- very important- please remember to edit the file

	ROOTDIR/etc/rc.d/networker.sh

to restrict the access rights to servers you want to have access
to this machine.

This release is known to work under FreeBSD 4.4. It should work
under FreeBSD-4.3. It should also work under FreeBSD-5.0.
