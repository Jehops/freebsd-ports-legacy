This is a simple plugin for gkrellm that shows you how fast your
mouse is going (in the chart) and the total distance in pixels it
has travelled since the plugin was started. It's pretty simple and
mindless, and probably shouldn't be relied upon to produce
ultra-accurate data, but it gets the point across.
