--------------------- Networker Configuration Information --------------------

The networker clients need to have a Networker server somewhere on
the network that will agree to take these clients on. Please consult
Networker documentation from Legato about this.

This version of the client places all binaries in ROOTDIR/nsr/bin-
adjust your PATH environment variable to reflect this.

Also- very important- please remember to edit ROOTDIR/etc/rc.d/networker.sh
to restrict the access rights to servers you want to have access to this
machine.
