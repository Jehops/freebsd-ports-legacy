This program displays information gathered from a motherboard
power management controller (e.g. LM78/79) onto a [standard]
WindowMaker dock app.  Displayed values include fan speeds,
motherboard temperature, and various voltages. 

Currently, the /dev/smb0 interface is only supported in FreeBSD
4.0 and 3.3-STABLE (after 01 November 1999); however, the
/dev/io interface may work with many motherboards in FreeBSD
3.x and some non-LM78/79 motherboards.
