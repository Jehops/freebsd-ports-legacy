`phttpget' is a Pipelined HTTP GET utility.

This is different from "normal" HTTP in that it allows the HTTP
client to have several HTTP requests "in flight" at once, and can
dramatically increase performance when a large number of small files
need to be downloaded. (This was the case with portsnap, where
downloading 300 files of 200 bytes each is not unusual). 

Note that phttpget is currently extremely minimalist.
