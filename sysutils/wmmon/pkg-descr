WMMon monitors the realtime CPU load as well the average system load and gives
you some nice additional features too...

WMMon currently provides:

        * Realtime CPU 'stress' meter;
        * Average systemload, like xload & wmavgload;
        * Average systemload graphic is autoscaling;
        * Realtime Disk I/O 'stress' meter;
        * Average Disk I/O load grapic (autoscaling);
        * Realtime total Mem & Swap usage meters;
        * System uptime display;
        * Realtime cycling through all monitor modes;
        * Can lauch 3 user definable commands through ~/.wmmonrc;
        * Can be started multiple times;
        * Commandline options for help (-h), version (-v),
          start mode (-i & -s) and display (-d);

** NOTE - a trivial root exploit was discovered in the current version. As
   a result, we no longer install the binary setuid root - meaning it
   cannot be run by arbitrary users.
