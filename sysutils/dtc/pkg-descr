A hosting web GUI for admin and accounting apache/named/proftpd/qmail
Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a set of PHP scripts and a web
interface that manage a MySQL database that handles all the host
information. It generates backup scripts, statistic calculation scripts, and
config files for bind, Apache, qmail, and proftpd, using a single system
UID/GID. With DTC, you can delegate the task of creating subdomains, email,
and FTP accounts to users for the domain names they own, and monitor
bandwidth per user and service.
