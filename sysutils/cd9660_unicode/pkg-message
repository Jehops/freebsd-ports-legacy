 You can load the module by typing (as root of course):

 # kldload %%PREFIX%%/lib/cd9660_unicode/cd9660_<encoding>.ko

 where <encoding> is any name from the following list:

 %%ENCODINGS%%.

 If you have a CD with filenames in a single byte language/encoding
 that doesn't listed here, feel free to send me conversion table
 between that encoding and Unicode and I'll include it into the
 distribution.
