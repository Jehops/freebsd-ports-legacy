Note:
 * Be sure your kernel is built with "options SYSVMSG" and "options SYSVSHM".
   Cdrdao requires kernel with these options. 
 * Also, you must include 
    
        options             "P1003_1B"
        options             "_KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING"
        options             "_KPOSIX_VERSION=199309L"

   in your kernel configuration. These options are required by POSIX thread
   control functions.
