The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection of UNIX-based
command line file system and media management forensic analysis tools.  The
file system tools allow you to examine file systems of a suspect computer in
a non-intrusive fashion.

The media management tools allow you to examine the layout of disks and
other media.  The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk
labels), Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT
disks.  With these tools, you can identify where partitions are located and
extract them so that they can be analyzed with file system analysis tools.
