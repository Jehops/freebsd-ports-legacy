NDir is a console-based utility to display the contents of
directories, just like 'ls' or 'dir'.

NDir is designed to present its output in a more informative way to
the user. This includes a summary line with some directory statistics,
different levels of verbosity, colourized output and intelligent
handling of very long file names.
