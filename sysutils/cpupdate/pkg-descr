x86 CPU microcode utility for BSD.

It is still work in progress but should do its job for Intel chips already.

Note: update FreeBSD to OSVERSION level 1101507 for 11.x or 1200055 for 12.0+
before building/using this utility if your microcode update brings
new CPU features like Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS).
