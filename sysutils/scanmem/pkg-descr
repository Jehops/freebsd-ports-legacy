Scanmem is a simple interactive debugging utility for Linux, used to locate
the address of a variable in an executing process. This can be used for the
analysis or modification of a hostile process on a compromised machine,
reverse engineering, or as a "pokefinder" to cheat at video games.

It requires linprocfs(5) to be mounted under /compat/linux/proc to operate.
