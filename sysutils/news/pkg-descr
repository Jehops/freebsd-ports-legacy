Introduction

News is used to read and maintain news relevant to a local system.  
Typically it is run from the .login script so it can automatically 
check for any new news items.  If it finds any, it will report,  
"You have news:  item1 item2 etc..."

To read the news, simply type "news".  Note, you may wish to type
"news | more" in case the news is too long to fit on a single
screen.

For complete information on the program, see the man page.


Administration

To add news items to your system, simply copy a text file containing
the information to the news directory.  (This directory defaults to 
/var/news, but can be changed in the Makefile or through the
environment variable, NEWS_PATH)
