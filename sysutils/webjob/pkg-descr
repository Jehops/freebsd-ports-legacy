WebJob downloads a program over HTTP/HTTPS and executes it in one
unified operation. The output, if any, may be directed to stdout/stderr
or a Web resource. WebJob may be useful in incident response and
intrusion analysis as it provides a mechanism to run known good
diagnostic programs on a potentially compromised system. It can
also support a variety of centralized management and host-based
monitoring solutions.
