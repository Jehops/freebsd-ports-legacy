Nctop is a remote system monitor for unix hosts.

It is a client/server-application using UDP-packets to receive the information 
of the hosts running the daemon and listed in the clients configuration file. 
For each host the client displays a line containing:

    * hostname
    * load averages
    * cpu states (sys/user/idle)
    * real memory usage (used/free/total)
    * number of users currently logged in
