Multitail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail program.
The difference is that this program creates multiple windows on your console
(with ncurses). It can also use colors while displaying the logfiles for faster
recognizing which lines are important and which are not. It is optimized for
terminal-sessions through slow links.
