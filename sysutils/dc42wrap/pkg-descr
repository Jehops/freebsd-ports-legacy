dc42wrap was created several years ago to produce open-source
operating system boot floppies for a PC that couldn't boot from
CD-ROM, in an environment where the only physically accessible
machines with floppy disk drives were Apple Macintoshes.

"raw" disk image -> FTP -> dc42wrap
FTP -> [Macintosh OS 7/8/9] -> physical floppy

When Apple stopped including floppy drives in their hardware,
this software fell into disuse ... until someone needed to copy
the contents of an ancient pile of HFS-formatted floppies onto a
floppy drive-less Macintosh running OS X, and the only physically
accessible machines with floppy disk drives were PCs running an
open-source operating system.

Even though Apple now uses NDIF as their preferred disk image
format, modern software still understands DiskCopy 4.2 files ...
and OS X will happily mount those old HFS images on the desktop.

physical floppy -> dd -> dc42wrap
SSH -> [Macintosh OS X] -> mounted filesystem
