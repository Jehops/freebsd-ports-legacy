To use uhidd daemon for USB HID devices, depends on which sub class
driver you want to attach, to avoid confilicts between the daemon and
the kernel drivers, you need to remove some of these entries 'device
ums', 'device ukbd', or 'device uhid' from your kernel config file and
recompile the kernel. Or if these drivers are loaded as kernel
modules, kldunload those that conflicts.

If you want to run uhidd deamon at the startup, add the following lines to
/etc/rc.conf:

	uhidd_flags="-kmohs"
	uhidd_enable="YES"

Note that you need to modify the uhidd_flags (command line options)
according to which sub class drivers you want to use.

To manually start/stop uhidd daemon on certain device, run:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/uhidd [start|stop] /dev/ugen.X.Y

See http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/uhidd for more details about how to install and
setup the daemon.
