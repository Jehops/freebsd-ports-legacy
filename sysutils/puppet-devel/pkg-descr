Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using
a cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate
elements normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and
hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and
files.

This is a developement version of sysutils/puppet. Use this if you'd like to
give the latest release a try. Do NOT use in production environment.

What makes it stable depends on comments from developers, such as
http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/DownloadingPuppet and feedback from
users.
