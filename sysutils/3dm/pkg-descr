The 3DM, disk management utility, allows you to view status and version
information about your 3ware storage controller. 3DM alerts you when a
disk array needs maintenance and from 3DM, you can maintain your disk
arrays. You can add or remove drives, specify an available drive as a
hot spare or launch the rebuild process. Array status can be viewed or
arrays can be maintained remotely via a standard web browser provided
you have access to the network containing the 3ware controller. In the
Windows environment, array status can also be checked in the local popup
notifier.

Event notification occurs from 3DM when the controller requires attention,
such as when a disk array becomes degraded and is no longer fault tolerant.
Event notification will only occur while 3DM is running, so we recommend
that 3DM be left running as a background utility on the controller's
machine. Event notifications email feature can send an email to a specified
recipient when there is a problem with the array.
