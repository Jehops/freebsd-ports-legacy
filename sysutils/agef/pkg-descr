This is the third revision of the AGEF (please pronounce this
AGE-F, for "age files") program, which was initially posted to
net.sources March 2, 1987.

This version of the program can age by inode change time (-c),
file modification time (-m), or time of last access (-a).

This program is useful for cleaning up disks and maintaining
large collections of small files, such as mail or news spools.
