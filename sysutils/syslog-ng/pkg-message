syslog-ng is now installed!  To replace FreeBSD's standard syslogd
(/usr/sbin/syslogd), complete these steps:

1. Create a configuration file named __PREFIX__/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
   (a sample named syslog-ng.conf.sample has been included)

2. Configure syslog-ng to start automatically by adding the following
   to /etc/rc.conf:

        syslog_ng_enable="YES"

3. Prevent the standard FreeBSD syslogd from starting automatically by
   adding a line to the end of your /etc/rc.conf file that reads:

        syslogd_enable="NO"
 
4. Shut down the standard FreeBSD syslogd:

     kill `cat /var/run/syslog.pid`

5. Start syslog-ng:

     __PREFIX__/etc/rc.d/syslog-ng.sh start
