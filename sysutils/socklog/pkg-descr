socklog in cooperation with djb's daemontools is a small and secure replacement
for syslogd. There are three main features, syslogd provides:

- receiving syslog messages from an unix domain socket (/dev/log) or UDP socket
  (0.0.0.0:514) and writing them to various files on disk depending on facility
  and priority.  
- writing received syslog messages to an udp socket (a.b.c.d:514)

socklog provides the first two features with the help of daemontools svscan,
supervise and multilog, provides a different network logging concept and
additionally does log event notification.

multilog has a built in logfile rotation based on file size, so there is no
need for any cron jobs or similar to rotate the logs. Log partitions can be
calculated properly.
