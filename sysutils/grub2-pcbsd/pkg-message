This version of GRUB includes support for PC-BSD style boot
environments. For it to properly detect / populate your
BE menus you must have your root zpool setup in the following
manner:

<tank>/ROOT/<be>

Where <tank> is your zpool, and <be> is your '/' mountpoint.
The "beadm" utility must be installed and working before using
GRUB utilities. 

Additionally, when using GPT, you must have a created a
"bios-boot" partition at install time. This partition is used
for GRUB's modules for GELI/ZFS and related bits.

To install GRUB as your boot-loader, use the following command:

# grub-install /dev/ada0 (replace ada0 with your disk)
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
