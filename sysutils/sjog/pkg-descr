From the website:

S-Jog is a program that uses the Sony Vaio laptop's Jog Wheel to do
various things:

    * Launch applications
    * Adjust screen brightness
    * Adjust volume
    * Act like a mousewheel

S-Jog pops up when you click the Jog Wheel then disappears after 3 seconds
of idle time. The mousewheel feature is turned on when S-Jog is hidden.
