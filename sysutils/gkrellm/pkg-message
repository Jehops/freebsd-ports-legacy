  If you want to support LM78/79 feature,
  `make install WITH_SENSOR=yes' at the "${PORTSDIR}/sysutils/gkrellm"
  directory to re-make this package.
  You should aware that GKrellM must be setuid root to obtain
  temperatures.  Furthermore, this causes problem on some
  motherboards.  If your motherboard doesn't support LM78/79 feature,
  you should not enable this.
