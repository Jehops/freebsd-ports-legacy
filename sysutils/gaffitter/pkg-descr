Genetic Algorithm File Fitter, GAFFitter for short, is a tool based
on a genetic algorithm (GA) that tries to fit a collection of items
into as few as possible volumes of a specific size.

For example, the items might be files/directories and the volumes
might be CDs or DVDs.

The task of arranging items in such manner that the number of
required bins is minimized is called Bin Packing, a NP-hard
combinatorial problem for which no deterministic polynomial-time
algorithm is known. Using heuristics, such as GAs, it is usually
possible to approximate -- and often reach -- the best solution for
the problem within a reasonable time.
