gpkgdep shows the FreeBSD package dependencies
in three different views:
- a tree view shows all packages required by each package
- a tree view shows all packages which depend on each package
- a list view allows to play with the packages. By marking all
wanted packages all reqiured are marked as well. This helps to
identify unused packages.
