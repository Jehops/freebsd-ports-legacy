WMAPM is an APM/Battery Monitor.  It is used  to  visually
display  and  interpret details of APM/Battery status from
the system's BIOS via Linux and FreeBSD kernels.

WMAPM is dockable using WindowMaker and AfterStep  window-
managers;  under other window-managers, WMAPM appears as a
nicely-sized 64x64 application.

NOTE: You need APM driver in your kernel. And enable it to edit
      file /etc/rc.conf at `apm_enable=NO' to `YES'.

NOTE2: You should add your acount name to operetor in /etc/group, if
you resume or suspend your PC by clicking the button in wmapm.
