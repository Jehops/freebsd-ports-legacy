Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of server.conf, log4j.xml, and
graylog_logging.xml, and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb36
- textproc/elasticsearch5

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.
