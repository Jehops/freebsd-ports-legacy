Quoting IPMITool homepage:

"IPMItool is a simple command-line interface to systems that support the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) v1.5 specification. It
provides the ability to read the SDR and print sensor values, display
the contents of the SEL, print FRU information, read and set LAN
configuration parameters, and perform chassis power control."

FreeBSD has ipmi(4) driver for in-band IPMI operations in
7-current after 2006-02-12. On older systems only out-of-band
LAN and LANPlus interfaces are supported.
