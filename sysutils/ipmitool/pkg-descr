Quoting IPMITool homepage:

"IPMItool is a simple command-line interface to systems that support the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) v1.5 specification. It
provides the ability to read the SDR and print sensor values, display
the contents of the SEL, print FRU information, read and set LAN
configuration parameters, and perform chassis power control."

Currently only LAN and LANPlus interfaces are supported on FreeBSD.
