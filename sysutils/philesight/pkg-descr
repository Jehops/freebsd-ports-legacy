Philesight is a tool to browse your filesystem and see where the diskspace
is being used at a glance. Philesight is implemented as a simple command
line program that generates PNG files; a wrapper CGI script is supplied to
allow navigating through the filesystem.

Philesight is actually a clone of the filelight program. Wheres filelight
is ment as an interactive, user friendly application for the X-windows
desktop, philesight is designed to run on a remote server without
graphical user interface.
