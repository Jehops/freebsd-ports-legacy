The goals of this project are: create a new Linux kernel driver for the NTFS
file system (v1.2 and later 3.0), user space utilities (e.g. format, ntfs
check, etc.) and a library to avoid code duplication and provide access to
NTFS to other GPLed programs.

It includes a read-only fusefs driver to mount NTFS volumes, but a read-write
version exists in sysutils/fusefs-ntfs. They can be installed simultaneously.
