heat allows you to monitor the thermal aspects measured by the
Winbond chipset on your motherboard.  It also supports the
ability to monitor fans, and provides workarounds for known bugs
with certain motherboard models.  It does not monitor voltages
(yet).

Currently, the only supported chipsets are the following:
  * Winbond 83781D  <untested>
  * Winbond 83627HF <untested>
  * Winbond 83782D
  * Winbond 83783S  <untested>
