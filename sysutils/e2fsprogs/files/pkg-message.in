To have your ext2 and ext3 filesystems fsck'ed correctly without explicitly
invoking the fsck_ext2fs utility installed by this port you will need to
create links for the fsck utilities installed by this port in /sbin, e.g.

ln -f %%PREFIX%%/sbin/fsck_ext2fs /sbin/ 2>/dev/null \
  || install -m755 %%PREFIX%%/sbin/fsck_ext2fs /sbin/
ln -f %%PREFIX%%/sbin/e2fsck.static /sbin/e2fsck 2>/dev/null \
  || install -m755 %%PREFIX%%/sbin/e2fsck.static /sbin/e2fsck

IMPORTANT: you also need to repeat the above steps after a port upgrade!
