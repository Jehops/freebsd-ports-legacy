===========================================================================
Note: FreeBSD's ext2fs module, as of release 7.1, cannot mount ext2 file
systems with 256-byte large inodes, only 128 byte sized.  Unfortunately,
256 byte is the default size with many recent Linux distributions.
The inode size cannot be changed after creation of a file system either.
This port overrides the default to 128 bytes, but this only applies to ext2
file systems created with this particular mke2fs.  If you format ext2 file
systems with other operating systems, make sure that mke2fs is called with
"-I 128" for partitions that you plan to share with FreeBSD.
Remember to backup your data before re-formatting any existing file
systems!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: this is a modified version of the e2fsprogs package, not the official
package. Report all building and run-time trouble that originates in the
package to the port maintainer, <matthias.andree@gmx.de>.
