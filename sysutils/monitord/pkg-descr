This port allows one to monitor other standalone services and
automatically restart them if they are accidentally and unwittingly
terminated, or crash either because of instability or a DoS attack. It
simplifies a corresponding task capable of being performed by cron(8) by
not requiring scripts to be run from a cron tab that in turn checks for
the *.pid files of services to determine whether they are running, but
instead uses procfs to determine if they are running or not. The
configuration file is simple and easily setup.

Note: version 0.2.0 and up have a slightly different configuration file
format and any previous configuration file from version 0.1.0 should
be updated accordingly.
