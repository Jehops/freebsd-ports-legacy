Use zap to maintain ZFS snapshots with cron.

- Uses neither configuration files nor custom ZFS properties
- all information is supplied when zap is invoked and stored in snapshot
  names.
- Uses namespaces to avoid collisions with other snapshots.
- Creates and destroys snapshots only when it makes sense to.
- Written in POSIX sh.
