Guarding disk space is one of the problems of system management.

Using a list of pathnames, this program filters the output of du(1) to
find the amount of disk space used for each of the paths (actually, it
collects all values in one single du run). It adds the new value to
the list, shifting old values up. It then generates a nice report of
the amount of disk space occupied in each of the specified paths,
together with the amount it grew (or shrinked) since the previous run,
and since 7 runs ago. When run daily, this gives daily and weekly
figures.

This program requires perl version 3.0, patchlevel 4 or higher.
