U-Boot loader and related files for Raspberry Pi 2

To install this bootloader, copy ALL the files in the share/u-boot/u-boot-rpi2
directory to the first partition, formatted as FAT32, on an SD card.

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The default environment is trimmed to just what's needed to boot.
 * The saveenv command writes to the file uboot.env on the FAT partition.
