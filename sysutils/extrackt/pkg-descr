Extrackt is essentially an audio CD ripper and encoder. It allows you to
choose your ripper and encoder based on templates which give Extrackt the
ability to use multiple built in and user defined ones. Extrackt is logically
split into a frontend (gui) and a backend (ripping / encoding / cddb etc).
and allows for frontends to be written using any toolkit like Etk, Ewl, Gtk,
or even pure Evas / Edje (not to mention ncurses or simlpe shell ones).
