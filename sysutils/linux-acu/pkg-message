acu installed under ${PREFIX}/bin
	to allow root access to your X session,
	run 'xhost localhost' or use sudo.
	acu will not run with linprocfs since it needs to see:
		/compact/linux/proc/aironet
	acu annoyingly creates
		/compat/linux/etc/eth?.cfg
	and will use that over the current card's settings.
