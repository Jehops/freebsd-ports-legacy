************************************************************

EasyPBI has been successfully installed on your system.
You can now create your pbi-modules.

You will need to add ports-mgmt/pbi-manager to build and
use PBIs on FreeBSD.

Building from modules is not supported through EasyPBI on 
bare FreeBSD.
