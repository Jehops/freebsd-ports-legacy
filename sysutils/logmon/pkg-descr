This program will monitor one or more log files, updating when more data is
available ala 'tail -f' , within a common terminal window via a "split window".
User can scroll up/down/left/right through all the windows. A header displays
each frames file name, and number of lines in the file. Very usefull when
watching several log files at the same time. I've tested this under Linux, but
it should work under other Unices. Please let me know if you get it working on
another OS.
