In order to automatically load the fuse module on startup, you need to
set the following settings:

 - Set the module path in /etc/sysctl.conf:
   kern.module_path=%%MODULE_PATH%%

 - Add fusefs_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf

%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/fuse.sh start will load the module for the first time
after the installation.
