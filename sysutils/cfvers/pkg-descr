cfvers is a versioning system for configuration files. It is similar to 
cvs and subversion, but different in its orientation toward system 
configuration files (think /etc), dealing with all file types and 
attributes.

Features:
- does not pollute the filesystem outside its dirs; 
- keeps both data and metadata (owner, group, perms, atime, mtime); 
- deals with all types of files (S_IFSOCK, S_IFLNK, S_IFREG, S_IFBLK, 
	S_IFDIR, S_IFCHR, S_IFIFO);
