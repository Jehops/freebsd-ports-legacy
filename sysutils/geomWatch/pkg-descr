geomWatch is a program for monitoring the well-being of GEOM providers. It
checks the state of each configured provider at a configured interval, and, if
it notices that a provider has lost a component, or encounters a problem while
checking a provider's state, it will send an e-mail with details of the
matter--such as what components were lost and which remain, or, in the event of
a problem, what the problem was--to an arbitrary number of recipients, so that
corrective action can be taken (for example, replacing a failed disk).
