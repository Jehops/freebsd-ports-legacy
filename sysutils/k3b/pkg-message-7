Notes for FreeBSD 7.x and onwards users:
1. The FreeBSD k3b port supports SCSI drives only. If you have IDE CD or DVD
   drives, use them through the cam system. See Chapter 12.5.9 of the handbook
   (http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-cds.html#ATAPICAM)
2. Your CD and DVD drives must have a mount point in /etc/fstab. They have
   to be accessed through their atapicam device if possible. I.e. the drives
   have to be adressed by e.g. /dev/cd0 instead of /dev/acd0.
3. k3b has to be started from a root console, which is not recommended.
   Alternatively do ALL of the following:
3a. set the suid flag on cdrecord and cdrdao. The 'Notes' chapter of
    'man cdrecord' discusses this.
3b. - For every user who should be able to use k3b and for every CD or DVD
      device add a directory in the users home directory. These directories
      must be owned by the corresponding user. For each such directory add a
      line in /etc/fstab (see remark 2), like:
        /dev/cd0c  /usr/home/XXX/cdrom  cd9660  ro,noauto,nosuid  0  0
      Furthermore allow user mounts as described in topic 9.22 of the FAQ:
      http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/disks.html#USER-FLOPPYMOUNT
      Every user must have read and write access to /dev/cdX:
        * add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
            add path 'cd*' mode 666
          or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
            add path 'cd*' mode 660 group XXX
        * to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf a
            devfs_system_ruleset="system"
    - or just give mount and umount the suid flag, which is a security leak.
3c. Every user who should be able to use k3b must have read and write access
    to all pass through devices connected with CD and DVD drives and to the 
    /dev/xpt0 device. Run 'camcontrol devlist' to identify those devices (seek 
    string 'passX' at the end of each line). Note, that this is a security 
    leak as well but that there is no alternative! 
        * add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
            add path 'pass*' mode 666
            add path 'xpt0' mode 666
          or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
            add path 'pass*' mode 660 group XXX
            add path 'xpt0' mode 660 group XXX
        * to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf a
            devfs_system_ruleset="system"
        * to apply these changes without reboot, run as root:
            /etc/rc.d/devfs restart
4. Check, that DMA is activated for atapi devices: 'sysctl hw.ata.atapi_dma'
   If not, set it to 1 and put a 'hw.ata.atapi_dma=1' into /boot/loader.conf.
5. Create a directory on a partition, which has enough disk space to hold a CDs
   or DVDs content (usually below /usr). Enter this directory in Settings->
   Configure K3b...->Misc.
6. If you experience problems while burning CDs, try to set the cdrdao driver 
   manually. To do so choose Settings->Configure K3b...->Devices. Below the CD 
   recorder click on the string "auto" behind "Cdrdao driver:" For most of the 
   recent drives "generic-mmc" or "generic-mmc-raw" should work. 
   See http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html.
