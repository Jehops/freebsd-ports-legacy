Memfetch is a very simple utility that can be used to dump process memory of 
any userspace process running on the system without affecting its execution.
Why bother? Well, quite often it is desirable to see what code and what data
actually resides in memory under some pid (/proc entries are not always
accurate). Debuggers like gdb are pretty good for examining small sections
of code or memory, but are pretty much useless for massive comparison, 
sophisticated searches and such. It's good to be able to retrieve full
memory image to run it thru grep, strings, your favorite viewer or any other
tool. Quite obviously, I developed this code not because it's extremely
difficult to do it on your own, but because it is a valuable shell utility
for all kinds of deep hacking activities that simply saves you time.

Memfetch is a convenient screenshot grabber for ssh or screen sessions, by 
the way ;-)
