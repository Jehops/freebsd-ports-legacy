Installing a FreeBSD desktop from scratch can be messy : you often
forget the correct steps/packages. The mkdesktop script helps to
standardize the process as much as possible per user, with plenty of
flexibility as well as modularity. The script sets up X & your desktop,
configures emulation layers (Wine / Linuxulator) if so desired, and
then configures the essential system files under /etc and /boot.
