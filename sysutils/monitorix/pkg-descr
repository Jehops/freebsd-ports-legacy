Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool designed
to monitor as many services and system resources as possible. It has been
created to be used under production UNIX/Linux servers, but due to its
simplicity and small size may also be used to monitor embedded devices as
well.

It mainly consists mainly of two programs: a collector, called monitorix, which
is a Perl daemon that is started automatically like any other system service,
and a CGI script called monitorix.cgi.

Every time 'monitorix' is started it reads the configuration file from the path
specified in the command line (using the -c option), and once checked, it
creates the 'index.html' file that will act as the Monitorix main page.

It also creates a file called '$BASE_DIR/cgi-bin/monitorix.conf.path' that
includes the absolute path of the configuration file. This file will be read
by 'monitorix.cgi' to determine the exact location of the configuration file.
If for any reason it is unable to locate this file, Monitorix will try two
alternative locations: '/etc/monitorix.conf' and
'/usr/local/etc/monitorix.conf'.
