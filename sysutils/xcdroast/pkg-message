                         ATTENTION!

You must be root to use xcdroast.  To use it as normal user,
type "make enable-nonroot" in the ports' directory.
But beware!  This is a security risk!
It modifies the following files and gives them the
set-user-ID-on-execution bit:

cdrecord(1)
readcd(1)
cdda2wav(1)
mkisofs(8)

All members of group "cdwrite" are able to run these files
as root.  Usually, these group has no members.
