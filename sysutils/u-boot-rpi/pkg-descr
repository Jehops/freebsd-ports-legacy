U-Boot loader for Raspberry Pi

To install this bootloader, copy the file uboot.img to the FAT parition
on an SD card.  Other files (not part of this package) are also required.

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The default environment is trimmed to just what's needed to boot.
 * The saveenv command writes to the file uboot.env on the FAT partition.
