The readlink utility when invoked with the pathname of a symbolic link as
its argument dereferences the symbolic link and prints the name of target
on standard output.  If readlink is invoked with an argument other than
the pathname of a symbolic link, it exits with a nonzero exit code with-
out printing anything.

In other words, this is a command-line interface to the readlink(2)
system call.
