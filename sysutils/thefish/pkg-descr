The Fish provides a graphical tool (based on GTK and ncurses) to manage and 
edit system variables stored in /etc/defaults/rc.conf and /etc/rc.conf. For
testing purposes, or, for users that need to have different configurations,
the program honours two environment variables: FISH_RC_DEFAULTS and
FISH_RC.
