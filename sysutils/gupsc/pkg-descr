This is a GNOME client for the Network UPS Tools Package. 
It will display information about battery-status, load-status, AC-current
and AC-frequency in a window. You can choose which machine to get the 
information from, and the rate at which it gets this information.

This package requires NUT on the machine the UPS is connected to. It does
not require NUT installed on the machine you want to run gupsc on. 
For information about how to configure NUT, and how to allow external 
machines to connect to the upsd, please check the documentation for NUT.
