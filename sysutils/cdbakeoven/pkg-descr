CD creation process should be fun and easy, don't you agree?!

However, most graphical CD-creation/copying tools available for
both Linux and Unix today, do just the opposite.

CD Bake Oven was designed with one goal in mind: combine the power
and stability of great command line utilities with contemporary
easy to use user interface. CDBO enables you to create data or music
CDs in the most intuitive matter, allowing you to control every
aspect of the process. It is built on top of very well known
'cdrecord', 'mkisofs', 'cdda2wav' and 'cdparanoia' encapsulating
most of the options those utilities provide. This makes creating
professional quality media as easy as making a few mouse clicks.
