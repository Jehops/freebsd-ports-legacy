gnome-find is an easy-to-use, but powerful, graphical version of the GNU "find"
utility. 

It is not just a front-end which just forks and execs "find", nor is it a
utility that reinvents the wheel by rewriting the "find" utility itself. 

The original source code to the GNU "find" utility (as found in findutils-4.1)
was used, and a GUI component was integrated into it. Consequently, the actual
file finding backend component is based on the very stable and mature code in
GNU "find", while the GUI component provides a modern, easy-to-use, yet
powerful, interface. 

By making it a truely graphical program, it avoids the common portability
problems typically encountered by front-ends when they run on systems without
GNU "find", as well as avoiding messy issues with forking a new process and
communicating with it (e.g., pipes, temporary files, etc.). 

gnome-find features a default, no-nonsense dialog for use in most commonly
specified searches. Additionally, a second, more detailed and advanced dialog
is available to specify more powerful search parameters.
