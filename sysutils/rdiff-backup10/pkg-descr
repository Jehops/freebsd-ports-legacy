rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The
target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse
diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you
can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best
features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves
subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it
is running as root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate
in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use
rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location,
and only the differences will be transmitted.

This port tracks the "old" stable branch 1.0. You can use this one until
you find the time to upgrade to the "new" stable branch 1.2 which is in
sysutils/rdiff-backup. This port will be removed at some point in the future
with advance notice of 3 months.
