Portupgrade is a very powerful tool to upgrade installed packages via
the port or the package.  It upgrades ports without reinstalling
dependent packages by directly modifying the package info recorded in
the files under /var/db/pkg.

This package also includes:

portversion:
	This is a replacement of pkg_version(8), which runs faster
	than pkg_version and is cooperative with portupgrade.

pkgdepfix:
	This is an interactive tool to fix /var/db/pkg's @pkgdep /
	+REQUIRED_BY discrepancies.
