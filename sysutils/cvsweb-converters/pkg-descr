Note: If you don't know what CVS, cvsup and cvsweb.cgi are then this
text is most likely not interesting for you.
This tool is primarily intended for people tracking the development of
FreeBSD and other open source projects with a public CVS repository.

This package provides three Perl scripts:
  + commitlog2cvsweb: converts FreeBSD commitlog files to HTML
  + cvsrdiff2cvsweb:  converts output of "cvs rdiff -s" to HTML
  + cvsuplog2cvsweb:  converts log output of "cvsup" to HTML

They basically transform their input to HTML, adding hyperlinks to a
cvsweb URL (cf. port devel/cvsweb) for each changed file. You can
browse a log of file changes and click on anything of interest to see
the details of the change.
In order to use this tool you need:
  1. access to a CVS repository of interest to you (either by
     local/remote cvs or by cvsup)
  2. WWW access to the repository with the cvsweb CGI.
To use commitlog2cvsweb you have to track the cvsroot-common and
cvsroot-src part of the FreeBSD CVS repository with cvsup. This
requires some 27 megabytes disk space for the commit logs.
