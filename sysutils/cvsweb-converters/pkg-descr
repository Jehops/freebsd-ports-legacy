Note: If you don't know what cvs, cvsup and cvsweb.cgi are then this
text is most likely not interesting for you. This is primarily
intended for people tracking the development of FreeBSD and other open
source projects with a public CVS repository.

This package provides three Perl scripts:
  + commitlog2cvsweb: converts FreeBSD commitlog files to HTML
  + cvsrdiff2cvsweb:  converts output of "cvs rdiff -s" to HTML
  + cvsuplog2cvsweb:  converts log output of "cvsup" to HTML

They basically transform their input almost unchanged to HTML, adding
only hyperlinks to a cvsweb.cgi script for each changed file. In order
to use them you need
  1. access to a CVS repository of interest to you (either by
     local/remote cvs or by cvsup)
  2. WWW access to the repository with a cvsweb CGI.
To use commitlog2cvsweb you have to mirror the src-base part of the
FreeBSD CVS repository. This is currently (2001) about 17 megabytes.

Other than saving you some typing (of URLs) these scripts won't do much
for you. You probably don't need this unless you frequently use cvsweb
or you got used to browse FreeBSD commit logs.
