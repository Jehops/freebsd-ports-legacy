This port helps tracking the development of FreeBSD and other open
source projects with a public CVS repository.

This package provides three Perl scripts:
  + commitlog2cvsweb: converts FreeBSD or DragonFlyBSD commitlog files to HTML
  + cvsrdiff2cvsweb:  converts output of "cvs rdiff -s" to HTML
  + cvsuplog2cvsweb:  converts log output of "cvsup" to HTML

They basically transform their input to HTML, adding hyperlinks to a
cvsweb URL (cf. port devel/cvsweb3) for each changed file. You can
browse a log of file changes and click on anything of interest to see
the details of the commit.
In order to use this tool you need:
  1. access to a CVS repository of interest to you (either by
     local/remote cvs or by cvsup)
  2. WWW access to the repository with the cvsweb CGI.
To use commitlog2cvsweb you have to track (at least) the
cvsroot-common and cvsroot-src part of the FreeBSD CVS repository with
cvsup. This requires about 32 megabytes disk space for the commit logs.
