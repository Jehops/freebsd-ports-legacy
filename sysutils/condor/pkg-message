SECURITY NOTICE:
Condor has been configured to accepted incoming connections from any
domain. This is useful for those that are just getting started with
Condor and does not pose any immediate threat to your system. Nevertheless,
we recommend changing this to only hosts that you trust to communicate with
your Condor pool.

See the manual for more information about tuning the HOSTALLOW_* paramters
in your system's condor_config file.

IMPORTANT:
You must set the CONDOR_CONFIG environment variable to the value shown
below before trying to start the master daemon, or submitting jobs to
Condor. This is will be fixed in future Condor stable series releases.
It is already fixed in the condor-devel port.
