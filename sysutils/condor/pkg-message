SECURITY NOTICE:
Condor has been configured to accepted incoming connections from any
domain. This is useful for those that are just getting started with
Condor and does not pose any immediate threat to your system. Nevertheless,
we recommend changing this to only hosts that you trust to communicate with
your Condor pool.

See the manual for more information about tuning the HOSTALLOW_* paramters
in your system's condor_config file.
