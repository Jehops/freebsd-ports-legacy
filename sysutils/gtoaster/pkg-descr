description from freshmeat.net -

Gnometoaster is a full CD creation suite for X11 and GNOME. It can be used to
copy and create data, audio, and mixed mode CDs on the fly or with precaching
in both TAO and DAO mode. Data tracks can easily be created with the built-in
file manager. GNOME drag-and-drop is supported throughout the program.
Gnometoaster can also write mp3 files on the fly, it is fully multisession
capable, and can be used to encode all sorts of filetypes directly from audio
tracks on a CD.
