This is TUA - "The Uucp Analyzer".

Its purpose is to collect all the information that the Honey Dan Ber
or the Taylor versions of the UUCP package put in their various logs,
tipically located in a few subdirectories on /usr/spool/uucp. It then
builds up a clear report, showing data from several different points of
view. It may even become an interactive customizable application by
linking in the TCL support.

It is fast, because all the data are maintained in binary trees; and
it has no arbitrary restriction on the size of the logs it can eat.
Very large sites can use the SoftChip Btree Library for faster searches.

It can maintains an history of the connections with the various sites
your machine is connected to, and a last-year summary of the amount of
data you received and transmitted, month-by-month.

You can get, in a chart form, the status of the usage of all your
serial port, so you can easily say when your modem is available for a
new link.
