-/* DESCRIPTION
-/*	This program dumps system memory to the standard output stream, 
-/*	skipping over holes in memory maps.
-/*	By default, the program dumps the contents of physical memory
-/*	(\fB/dev/mem\fR).
-/*
-/*	Output is in the form of a raw dump; if necessary, use the \fB-m\fR
-/*	option to capture memory layout information.
-/*
-/*	Output should be sent off-host over the network, to avoid changing
-/*	all the memory in the file system cache. Use netcat, stunnel, or
-/*	openssl, depending on your requirements.
-/*
-/*	The size arguments below understand the \fBk\fR (kilo) \fBm\fR (mega)
-/*	and \fBg\fR (giga) suffixes. Suffixes are case insensitive.

-/*	Warning: kernel virtual memory mappings change frequently. Depending

-/*	\fIbuffer_size\fR may be missed or may be reported incorrectly.

-/* .IP "\fB-d \fIdump-size\fR (default: 0)"

-/*	until the memory device reports an end-of-file (Linux), or until

-/*	by the kernel (FreeBSD, Solaris), or until pointer wrap-around happens.
