Krename is a very powerful batch file renamer for KDE3 which
can rename a list of files based on a set of expressions. It
can copy/move the files to another directory or simply rename
the input files. Krename supports many conversion operations,
including conversion of a filename to lowercase or to
uppercase, conversion of the first letter of every word to
uppercase, adding numbers to filenames, finding and replacing
parts of the filename, and many more. It can also change access
and modification dates, permissions, and file ownership.
