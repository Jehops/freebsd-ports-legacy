This is like comiccron, but stores the tabs in ZConf. For it to run the
command, the last or next time it will be will have to be within a minute
and 15 seconds. For most usages, you will want to have the hour and minute
set to *. This allows a user to do something how ever many times they want
any time during the period it is active.

After running through every entry in the crontab, it then exits.

Why not cron?

You can have cron open opera or the like on a specific display by either
switch or enviromental options, but it will always open it. This allows
you to open it any time along the point it is active.
