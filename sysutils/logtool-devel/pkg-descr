Logtool is a command line program that will parse syslog (and syslog-
like) logfiles into a more palatable format. It will take anything
resembling a standard syslog file (this includes syslog-ng, and
probably most of the other variants out there), and crunch it into one
of the following formats for your viewing pleasure: 

  - ANSI (colorized for easy "at a glance" viewing)
  - ASCII (for e-mail'ed reports, and term's that don't support color)
  - CSV (for importing into your favorite spreadsheet/database)
  - HTML (for generating web pages)
  - RAW (for no good reason)

It can be configured to parse the data any one of several ways,
including stripping the host, and/or program fields, and modifying the
time display format of the log entry's.
