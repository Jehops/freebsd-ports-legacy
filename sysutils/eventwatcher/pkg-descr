EventWatcher is a KDE application which notifies you  about various events.

"Events" are pieces of information about, for example, news ticker or blog
updates, new emails, user logons, system warnings, hardware events etc.
They get collected by EventWatcher plugins and sent to the main application
which lives in the KDE system tray for most of the time and displays this
information.
