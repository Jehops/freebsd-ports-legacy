be a tough job and this one makes it possible and easy too. gfslicer is
mainly aimed at slicing and transferring files using any sort of removable
storage media. Files can be sliced to any arbitrary size as per the
requirement and can be transferred using floppies or things of that sort.

errors in the sliced and desliced files.
