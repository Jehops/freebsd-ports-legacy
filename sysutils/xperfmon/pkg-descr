This package contains the binary release of xperfmon++ V2.0 a X based
system performance meter for several systems, ported to FreeBSD 2.2.X
and FreeBSD-3.X.

The program monitors:
  system load, user-, nice-, system-, interrupt-, idle-cputime,
  free swap, disk io, number of interrupts,
  network-input, -output, -collision packets and
  NFS client and server activity.

Please send BUGS and annotations to: Lars.Koeller@Uni-Bielefeld.DE

Major changes in xperfmon++ V1.3 due to xperfmon++ V1.1:

	- Clean fix of the -geometry option bug, now there is only
	  a MIN_WIDTH of 185 pixels. The MIN_HEIGTH is calculated
	  dynamically out of the number of active graphs.
	- Display 'Free Swap' in percent without resizing of the graph
	- Close some memory leaks
	- Display unit of graph in label field.

Changes from xperfmon++ V1.3 to xperfmon++ V1.33:

	- Fix event bug when resizing or moving the window.
	  (High cpu consumption when running xperfmon++ with mwm)
	- Changes in get_swapspace to compile with FreeBSD 2.2 (-current)

Changes from xperfmon++ V1.33 to xperfmon++ V1.40:

	- Fix -geometry option. Changing the size of the window now wokes
	  well. The start frame of the window has the correct size.
	- Changes in freebsd_system.c to compile with FreeBSD 30-current.
	- Clean the FreeBSD version number #if's

Changes from xperfmon++ V1.40 to xperfmon++ V2.0:

	- Add System Load graph
	- Add Nice and Interrupt CPU percentage graph
