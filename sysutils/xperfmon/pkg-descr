This package contains the binary release of xperfmon++ V1.3 a X based
system performance meter for several systems, ported to FreeBSD 2.X.

The program monitors user-, system-, idle-cputime, free swap, disk io,
number of interrupts, network-input, -output, -collision packets and
NFS client and server activity.

Please send BUGS and annotations to: lars.koeller@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de

Major changes in xperfmon++ V1.3 due to xperfmon++ V1.1:

	- Clean fix of the -geometry option bug, now there is only
	  a MIN_WIDTH of 185 pixels. The MIN_HEIGTH is calculated
	  dynamically out of the number of active graphs.
	- Display 'Free Swap' in percent without resizing of the graph
	- Close some memory leaks
	- Display unit of graph in label field.
