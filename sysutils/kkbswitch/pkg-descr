KKBSwitch is a keyboard layout indicator for KDE. It is useful
when you have configured the XKeyboard extension of your X Server
to have more than one keyboard group, for example US/ASCII and
Russian. KKBSwitch displays an icon in the system tray that
indicates which layout is currently active. Note that KKBSwitch
does not help you configure XKeyboard, it merely serves as the
indicator of the current group. You still have to configure
XKeyboard by editing XF86Config file.

KKBSwitch features:
- displays an icon in the KDE's system tray indicating the active
  keyboard group
- you can switch keyboard groups by clicking the icon or selecting the
  desired group from the icon's menu
- icons corresponding to different groups are configurable (chosen
  from country flag pixmaps that ship with KDE). Also you can set
  your own icon or set "Windows-like" mode with locale letters.
- "Toggle mode" (keyboard layout memorized for each window separately).
