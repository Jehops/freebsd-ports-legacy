Beats is the platform for building lightweight, open source data
shippers for many types of operational data you want to enrich with
Logstash, search and analyze in Elasticsearch, and visualize in Kibana.
Whether you're interested in log files, infrastructure metrics, network
packets, or any other type of data, Beats serves as the foundation for
keeping a beat on your data.

Metricbeat collects metrics from your systems and services. From CPU to
memory, Redis to Nginx, and much more, Metricbeat is a lightweight way to
send system statistics.
