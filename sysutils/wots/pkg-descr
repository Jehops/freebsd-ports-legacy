This is a port of WOTS, a Perl script for monitoring multiple system
logfiles and allowing actions to be carried out upon regexps being matched.
WOTS is able to alert the administrator using email, can perform syntax
coloring of messages (for use with roottail or, better still, in a small
'always-on-top' rxvt window -- or, as I prefer, on a dedicated vty).
