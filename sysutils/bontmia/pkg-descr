This is a port of bontmia, which is a tool to make incremental backups
over network using rsync and ssh. It supports storing of a given number
of archives in wich files that has not been changed since last backup
will be hard linked to previous archive to save space and bandwidth.

Bontmia is an acromyn of Backup Over Network To Multiple Incremental
Archives wich pretty good sums up its intended use.
