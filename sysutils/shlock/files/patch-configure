-WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
-
-  The temporary directory you have configured is world-writeable.  It is
-  currently set to $tmpdir.
-
-  This directory is used by INN for temporary files and should only be
-  writeable by the news user.  INN does not go to great lengths to prevent
-  symlink attacks and the like because it assumes this directory is not
-  world-writeable.  By configuring INN in this fashion, you may be
-  introducing a locally exploitable security hole.
-
-  It is STRONGLY recommended that you use a temporary directory reserved for
-  INN's exclusive use, one which is not world-writeable.  You can do this
-  either with --with-tmp-dir or by setting --prefix to something other than
-  /usr or /.
