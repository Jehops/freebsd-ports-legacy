bsdhwmon is a program for FreeBSD for monitoring hardware sensors (fans,
temperatures, voltages, chassis intrusion, and more) on commerical-grade
server hardware.

bsdhwmon is developed with a very different mentality compared to other
hardware monitoring software:

* Written with stability and production environments in mind
* Intended for use with server products (currently Supermicro, but can be
  extended to others that have proper SMBIOS identification data)
* Uses SMBus (smb(4) driver) exclusively, significantly decreasing risks
  and CPU usage compared to classic LPC I/O
* Based primarily on documentation provided by motherboard/server vendors,
  combined with documentation from chipset manufacturers
* Identifies hardware via strict SMBIOS data matching; device "probing" is
  avoided to minimise false positives and thus risks
* Full tested on both i386 and amd64 systems across multiple versions of
  FreeBSD (legacy and present-day)
* Written entirely in C
* No reliance on third-party libraries or tools (e.g. autotools, libtool,
  etc.)
* Very simple and clean code -- heavily commented, well-documented, built
  with -Werror -Wall and similar flags
* Occasionally tested under valgrind
* Open-source, released under the 2-clause BSD license
