Quantum is a tool to run SQL queries against a database. It allows
a user to bookmark databases and dynamically loads the JDBC driver.
It also allows you to view the tables, views, and sequences in a tree
format. This plugin was converted from a Swing app. New to the plug-in
version is wizards to insert, update, and delete table rows.
