	The OpenJIT project is an ongoing Java the programming language JIT
compiler project as a collaborative effort between Tokyo Institute of Technology
and Fujitsu Laboratory, partly sponsored by the Information Promotion Agency of
Japan.
	OpenJIT is a "reflective" JIT compiler in that not only it is almost
entirely written in Java, but also that it bootstraps and compiles itself during
execution of the user program, and compiler components coexist as first-class
objects in user heap space. Thus, users can tailor and customize the compilation
of classes at runtime for variety of purposes such as application-specific
optimization and partial evaluation, dynamic, compiler-assisted environment
adaptation of programs, debugging, language extension and experimentation, and
other types of advanced compiler-based research and applications. OpenJIT even
allows full dynamic update of itself by loading the compiler classes on the fly
from the network.
	OpenJIT is fully JDK compliant, and plugs into standard JVMs several
Unix platforms such as Solaris (Sparc), Linux (x86), and FreeBSD (x86).
	On Linux/x86 platform, OpenJIT 1.1.14 is faster than the JDK 1.2 classic
VM compiler, runs more or less the same speed as other commercial JIT compilers
on classic VM.
	OpenJIT is completely free so long as it is used for non-commercial
purposes.  Its source, binaries, etc. can be freely distributed and modified
without restriction.
