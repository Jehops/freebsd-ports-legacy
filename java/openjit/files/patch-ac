 A Reflective JIT Compiler for Java
 
-REQUIREMENTS
-============
-OpenJIT requires a running port of the JDK 1.1.x or 1.2.x on Solaris,
-Linux or FreeBSD platform. Please download JDK 1.1.x or later and
-install it on your system. The current version of OpenJIT was tested
-on the following JDK packages:
-
-  * Solaris (SPARC) JDK1.1.8 and JDK1.2.2
-    downloaded from http://java.sun.com/jdk/
-  * Linux (x86) JDK1.1.7 and JDK1.2.2
-    downloaded from http://www.blackdown.org/
-  * FreeBSD (x86) JDK1.1.8
-    downloaded from http://www.freebsd.org/java/
-
-And to build OpenJIT will require the GNU C Compiler (version 2.7.2.3
-or egcs-1.1.2, or later)
-
-
-BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
-=========================
-To install the OpenJIT into JDK, perform the following steps in your
-shell:
-
-    $ ./configure --with-jdk=/path/to/jdk
-    $ make
-    $ make install
-
-
 HOW TO RUN
 ==========
 You may either specify the compiler to the JVM on the command line, or
 you may set an environment variable that will let the JVM find the
 compiler.
+
+In both cases first you should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CLASSPATH enviropment
+variables as follows:
+
+    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=%%PREFIX%%/lib/OpenJIT
+    $ export CLASSPATH=%%PREFIX%%/lib/OpenJIT/OpenJIT.jar
 
 For the command line option, run Java using option "-Djava.compiler=",
 like this example:
