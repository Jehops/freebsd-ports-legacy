This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.
Kaffe comes with an own implementation of the Java standard classes,
including the Awt classes.

Running Kaffe
=============
Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of CLASSPATH, KAFFEHOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

 CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/kaffe/Klasses.jar:\
     /usr/local/share/kaffe/pizza.jar
 KAFFEHOME=/usr/local/share/kaffe
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

You can run "sh /usr/local/share/kaffe/ENVIRONMENT" to have these set for
you.

What's in there
===============

For further info see the file README that comes with the distribution.
