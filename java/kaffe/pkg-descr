This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.  Unlike
other virtual machines available, this machine performs "just-in-time"
code conversion from the abstract code to the host machine's native code.
This will ultimately allow execution of Java code at the same speed as
standard compiled code but while maintaining the advantages and flexibility
of code independence.

Please note, this is version 0.3 and many feature are not yet implemented
(notable there is no graphics support at the moment) and there are likely
to be various odd bugs.  All comments to the mail address below.

Major changes in Kaffe v0.3
===========================

 * Split off Kaffe translator into a shared library.  This makes it
   simpler to encorporate into other programs and is essential to
   getting Kaffe running on some OS's.

 * Added array bounds checks.  This is very slow but the people want it
   slow rather than not at all.

 * Additional ports have been added.

 * Extensive bug fixes for both particular ports as well as the general
   system.
