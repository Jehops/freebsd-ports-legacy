This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.
This machine can be configured in two modes.  In one mode it operates as
a pure bytecode interpreter (not unlike Javasoft's machine); in the second
mode if performs "just-in-time" code conversion from the abstract code to
the host machine's native code.  This will ultimately allow execution of
Java code at the same speed as standard compiled code but while maintaining
the advantages and flexibility of code independence.

Running Kaffe
=============
Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of CLASSPATH, KAFFEHOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

 CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/kaffe/classes.zip
 KAFFEHOME=/usr/local/share/kaffe
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

You can run "sh /usr/local/share/kaffe/ENVIRONMENT" to have these set for
you.

What's in there
===============
