This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.  Unlike
other virtual machines available, this machine performs "just-in-time"
code conversion from the abstract code to the host machine's native code.
This will ultimately allow execution of Java code at the same speed as
standard compiled code but while maintaining the advantages and flexibility
of code independence.

Please note, this is version 0.2 and many feature are not yet implemented
(notable there is no graphics support at the moment) and there are likely
to be various odd bugs.  All comments to the mail address below.
