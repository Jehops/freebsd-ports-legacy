KAFFE v0.5p1 - A JIT and interpreting virtual machine to run Java(tm)* code
===========================================================================

This is Kaffe, a virtual machine design to execute Java bytecode.
This machine can be configured in two modes.  In one mode it operates as
a pure bytecode interpreter (not unlike Javasoft's machine); in the second
mode if performs "just-in-time" code conversion from the abstract code to
the host machine's native code.  This will ultimately allow execution of
Java code at the same speed as standard compiled code but while maintaining
the advantages and flexibility of code independence.

This release include the new JIT system.  Currently only a 386 JIT exists but
I intend to produce a SPARC jit machine in the near future to test is
portablility and then concentrate on improving the generated code quality.
However, these improvements will not effect the JIT target descriptions
(the jit-???.def files) so people may want to consider producing versions
for other platforms.

Running Kaffe
=============

This version of Kaffe is not supplied with a copy of Sun's class library.
FreeBSD users can install the jdk port/package for it.

Before running Kaffe it is necessary to configure the environment.
This requires the setting of CLASSPATH, KAFFEHOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For the standard installation these would be defined as follows:

	CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/kaffe/classes.zip
	KAFFEHOME=/usr/local/share/kaffe
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

A file "ENVIRONMENT" is generated by the configure program which contains
a /bin/sh environment setup.  This may help you to figure out what to
set to what if you alter the standard installation point.
