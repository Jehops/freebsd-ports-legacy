The Janos Virtual Machine (JanosVM) is a virtual machine for executing Java
bytecodes. Unlike any available virtual machine, the JanosVM supports multiple,
separate processes (called "teams" in JanosVM) within a single VM. Based on
KaffeOS (and thus Kaffe), the JanosVM supports per-team separate heaps, per-
team garbage collection threads, inter-team thread migration, safe cross-team
reference objects, and a spiffy tutorial. Designed to support asynchronous
termination of uncooperative or malicious Java bytecode applications, the
JanosVM provides robust and scalable multi-process support within a single
virtual machine.
