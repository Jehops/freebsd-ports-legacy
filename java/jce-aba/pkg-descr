The ABA JCE is a clean room implementation of the Java Cryptography
Extension (JCE) API as defined by Sun MicrosystemsTM, plus a provider of
underlying crypto algorithms. This package does not include any native code.

This JCE is based on the early access beta2 version of the JCE as available
from the Java Developer ConnectionTM early access area. Since the Sun JCE is
written for JDK 1.2, there are three versions of the library included. One
which is compatible with JDK 1.02, one with JDK 1.1 and one with JDK 1.2
(tested against JDK 1.2fcs).

The source for each version of the libraries may be found in this package as
src-1.x.zip. These archives may be unzipped using the jar tool or a zip
compatible archiver.

This package is covered by the ABA Public Licence. Please ensure you review
this licence before making use of this package. Support contracts are also
available.
