Eclipse 3.x caches all plugin.xml files into a single repository for quicker
loading.

If you used eclipse before installing PHPeclipse, you should start eclipse
once with the -clean option. This -clean forces Eclipse to rebuild that 
repository.

Please delete your old project.index files and run menu Project->Clean for
all projects to create the new project.index files.
