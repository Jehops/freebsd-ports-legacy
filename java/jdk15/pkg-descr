This is the latest JDK 1.5.0 patchset from the Java 2 FreeBSD porting
project.  This port allows you to easily build a native JDK1.5.0 for FreeBSD.

Please note that due to the current Sun licensing policy the resulting binaries
can't be distributed and you are only permitted to use/hack it personally.
Due to the same reasons you have to manually fetch the source code and patchset
for FreeBSD.
