The Java3D libraries are not installed in JRE, so you have to add
  %%TARGET_DIR%%/jar/j3daudio.jar
  %%TARGET_DIR%%/jar/j3dcore.jar
  %%TARGET_DIR%%/jar/j3dutils.jar
  %%TARGET_DIR%%/jar/vecmath.jar
to the CLASSPATH environment variable, and add
  %%TARGET_DIR%%/lib
to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
