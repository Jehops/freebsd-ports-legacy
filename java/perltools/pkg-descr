PerlTools(TM) makes using regular expressions in Java almost as
easy as in Perl!  Built on top of the OROMatcher(TM) regular expression
package, PerlTools(TM) provides highly reliable Perl5 regular
expression support for your Java programs while at the same time
taking the burden of compiling and caching pattern objects off of
your shoulders.
