======================================================================
This Java VM will attempt to detect the number of processors by taking
cpuinfo from linux's procfs. You may want to install the Linux
emulation procfs filesystem. You may do so by adding the following
line to your /etc/fstab file:

 linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc   linprocfs   rw   0  0

Also, enable 'options USER_LDT' in your kernel configuration.
