TYA is a ``100% unofficial'' JIT-compiler designed as an
add-on to the Blackdown ports of JDK 1.1.x for Linux (x86),
but currently experimental ported for usage with JDK 1.2.

For the command line option, run Java using option "-Djava.compiler=",
like this example:

java    -Djava.compiler=tya       Iview          Valetta.jpg
#         ^ set property ^        ^your pgm      ^ pgm's options

But a better and easier way is setting the JAVA_COMPILER environment
variable, as in

      export JAVA_COMPILER=tya
