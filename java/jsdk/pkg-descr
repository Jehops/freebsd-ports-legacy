The Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK) can be used to develop and test
server extensions based on the servlet API. Included is a standalone
server (called servletrunner) that can be used to test servlets
before running them in a servlet-enabled web server.

The JSDK serves as the reference implementation for the Java Servlet API.
This release will run on top of JDK 1.1.x. If you are interested in
developing servlets with JDK 1.2, there is no need to use this JSDK
as the servlet API is bundled with JDK1.2.

Please note that the source code for the servlet API is released with this
package.
