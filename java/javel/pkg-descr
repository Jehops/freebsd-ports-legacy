Javel is a java class file disassembler. It is a filter that, given a
compiled java class file, outputs a disassembled version in a java-like
form with all the interface, fields, methods, and the java assembler code
for each method. It can also output dependencies of the class file, suitable
for inclusion in a standard makefile.
