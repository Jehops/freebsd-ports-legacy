Clay is a database design tool that runs as a plug-in in the
Eclipse development environment. Clay has an intuitive user
interface for graphically designing database models. Clay can
also create a database model by reverse engineering an existing
database. Furthermore, Clay generates the SQL (DDL) code
appropriate for your database.
