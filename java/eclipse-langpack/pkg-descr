IBM has donated translations from their products to Eclipse. The
language packs group translations for several languages into a single
download which are distributed as a set of features which you can
install by extracting over your Eclipse directory and restarting
Eclipse. Specifically,

NLpackX contains the NL fragments and the NL features that contain
those fragments for the below languages with each X:

X=1: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
     Portuguese (Brazil), Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.
X=2: Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Russian.
X=2a: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Norwegian, Portuguese,
      Swedish and Turkish.
X=Bidi: Arabic and Hebrew.

These translations are based on the Eclipse 3.2 build but should work
with all subsequent 3.2.x maintenance releases. If new strings are
added to Eclipse after 3.2, they will not show up as translated in the
3.2.x stream when you install this language pack.
