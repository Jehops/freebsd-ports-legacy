The Eclipse Visual Editor project is a framework for creating GUI
builders for Eclipse.  It will include reference implementations of
Swing/JFC and SWT GUI builders, but intends to be useful for creating
GUI builders for other languages such as C/C++ and alternate widget
sets, including those that are not supported under Java.
