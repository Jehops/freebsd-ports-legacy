======================================================================
This Java VM will attempt to detect the number of processors and other
system information by accessing files in linux's procfs.  You must
install the Linux emulation procfs filesystem for this to work
correctly.  The JVM will core dump otherwise.  This can be 
accomplished by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

 linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc   linprocfs   rw   0  0

and then, as root, executing the commands:

kldload linprocfs
mount /compat/linux/proc 

Also, you must use a kernel with the option USER_LDT enabled.  Note
that this option is not enabled in the GENERIC kernel, so you will
need to compile a kernel with this option if you haven't already
done so.

NOTE: The JVM does not currently exit correctly unless the application
      has a specific call to System.exit().
