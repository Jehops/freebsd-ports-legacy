aoTuV is a variant of libvorbis enhanced for sound quality, based on
libvorbis 1.0.1 of Xiph.Org.

On the frequency of 26kHz or more, q-2 (nominal 40kbps/44.1-48kHz) can
be used.  A part of Nominal bitrate has changed.  Use of bitrate
management mode is not recommended. (In the future, psy.c and
mapping0.c will need to be improved.)
