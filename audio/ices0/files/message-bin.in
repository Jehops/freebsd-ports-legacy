To start ices at system boot, copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/ices.conf.dist to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/ices.conf, modify it to suit your environment and add:

ices0_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf.


ATTENTION: Due to mp3 licensing restrictions, this binary package of
	   ices0 does not feature transcoding support. If you want
	   support for transcoding FLAC, mp4 and vorbis data to mp3
	   on-the-fly, you need to compile the audio/ices0 port.
