Mp3stat is a utility to read information about mp3s and oggs bitstream. Most
specifically, how certain bitrates have been placed in the bitstream by the
encoder. Not only does mp3stat give you a graphical representation of the
average bitrate per 1/500th of the file in a linear bar graph to allow you to
compare encoders and settings, it also has a batch file mode. The batch file
mode allows you to use mp3stat as a script utility instead of gui, for use in
your own programs and or scripts. The batch mode can trivially be extended to
give just as much info as the gui version but now defaults to a configurable
output of 3 pieces of info, name, runtime, average bitrate. The batch mode
can take mp3s and oggs in the same directory but it cannot (not yet at least)
recursively run into subdirectories.
