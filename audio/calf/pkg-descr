The Calf project aims at providing a set of high quality open source
audio plugins for musicians. All the included plugins are designed
to be used with multitrack software, as software replacement for
instruments and guitar stomp boxes.

The plugins are available in following formats:

 - DSSI (both synthesizers and effects, GTK+ GUI is included)

 - Standalone JACK client application with GTK+-based GUI

 - LADSPA (only effect plugins, GUI not available unless host supports
   DSSI-style GUI for LADSPA), with LRDF. Note that use of LADSPA
   is strongly discouraged, as the limitations of the standard may cause
   serious inconvenience.
