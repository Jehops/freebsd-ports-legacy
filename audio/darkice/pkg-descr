DarkIce is an IceCast, IceCast2 and ShoutCast live audio streamer. It takes
audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and/or Ogg Vorbis, and
sends the mp3 stream to one or more IceCast and/or ShoutCast servers, the
Ogg Vorbis stream to one or more IceCast2 servers. DarkIce uses lame as a
shared object as its mp3 encoder, and the Ogg Vorbis as its Ogg Vorbis
encoder.
