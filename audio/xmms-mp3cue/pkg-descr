XMMS mp3cue adds cue file support to XMMS. Cue files store 
information (Artist, Title, Time) describing smaller tracks 
within a large audio file. mp3cue allows you to easily manipulate 
these cue files; and more importantly, it presents you with a 
separate playlist composed from the cue information which you can 
use to easily navigate to any of the smaller tracks in the audio 
file, just like a normal playlist. You can also save this cue 
information within an ID3v2 tag (if the audio file is an mp3), 
eliminating the need for an external cue file.
