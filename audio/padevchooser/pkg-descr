PulseAudio Device Chooser (padevchooser) is a simple GTK tool which registers
an icon in the tray area and allows quick access to some features of the
PulseAudio sound server. Specifically it can do for you:

 - Notify about new sink/sources becoming available on the LAN
 - Quickly change the default PulseAudio sink/source/server assigned to the
   current X11 display, selecting devices available on the LAN
 - Start the auxiliary tools PulseAudio Volume Control, PulseAudio Volume
   Meter, PulseAudio Manager, PulseAudio Preferences
