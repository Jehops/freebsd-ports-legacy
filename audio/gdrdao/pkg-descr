GdrDAO is a GTK-based GUI frontend for cdrdao, the disk-at-once audio CD
recorder. Features:

* Contains a simple TOC Editor, which allows you to create (very) simple TOC
files for CDRDAO .
* It can save those TOC files (now to a selectable file).
* GdrDAO supports Pregaps (including "hidden tracks"), and lets you decide
where to start in a file, so it also supports CD burned from one huge file.
* Disk Cataloge Number and ISRC can be changed.
* CD Text is supported.
