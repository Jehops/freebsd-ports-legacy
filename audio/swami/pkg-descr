Swami - Sampled Waveforms and And Musical Instruments - is an advanced
instrument editor for MIDI music composition and a sampler
frontend. Currently SoundFont(r) files can be browsed, edited and
saved and new instrument formats are being added in the Swami
development version. Swami uses FluidSynth for software synthesis, so
almost any sound card can be used. FluidSynth has real time effect
control and SoundFont 2.01 modulator support for controlling effects
in real time with MIDI.
