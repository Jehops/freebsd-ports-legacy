GUI program to semi-automatically download album cover images for a music
collection. It will work through a specified music directory, and for each
subdirectory will download a set of corresponding (best guess) album covers.
The naming format of the subdirectories can be configured, as can the
location to save the results, such as .desktop-entry files, folder.jpg
files, mp3 tags, etc.
