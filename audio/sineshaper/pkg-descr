A monophonic synth plugin that sends the sound from two sine
oscillators through two sine waveshapers in series.  You can control
the vibrato, tremolo, portamento, the tuning of both oscillators,
the oscillator mix, the shape amount (total and split over both
shapers) and the phase of the second waveshaper function.  There is
also an ADSR envelope generator that can control the total shape
amount and the amplification (with controllable sensitivity for
both), an LFO for the total shape amount, distortion, and a feedback
delay.

The shape amount and amplification is velocity sensitive, and the
synth supports MIDI pitch bend events (with a range of +/- 2
semitones).  All parameters can be controlled using MIDI Controller
events.
