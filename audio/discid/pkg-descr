    There may be bugs in the code as well as in the documentation. If
    you find either, I'd appreciate a patch or at least a mail message
    to let me know what's wrong.

    discid has been developed and tested on Linux and FreeBSD.  It may
    work on other platforms with modification, but I don't know.  If
    you install it on another platform, I'd like to hear about it. If
    you develop patches for that platform, I'd REALLY like to hear
    about it. Send me a note. There's nothing that I know to be
    platform-dependent in here yet, but you never know.
