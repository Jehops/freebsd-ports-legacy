This is Eric A. Welsh's collection of Gravis UltraSound MIDI patches,
configured for use with the TiMidity++ MIDI player.  A configuration file
for TiMidity++ to use these patches is also included.

I hope that all of these patches are the best ones you've ever heard.  I've
worked really hard to try to ensure this.  I collected patches from the
Ultrasound mirrors, Midia, Kurzweil archives, Roland archives, Yamaha
archives, Maui, maybe a few from MAZ, and just about every known source of
patches on the net.  I have tried to leave no stone unturned.

I have removed clicks, changed volumes of samples within multipart patches
so that they are the same relative to each other, relooped samples, created
new instruments by combining others, edited out bad samples, remapped the
note mappings to samples, rekeyed samples, retuned samples, changed
envelopes, hand edited some to remove oversampling, and just about any other
kind of manipulation you can think of.

I think by now I have listened to every patch while being played in a midi
file, so I've heard them over all sorts of ranges not intended for the
instruments, in combination with instruments that might be slightly out of
tune with the one in question, and heard most if not all the waveforms in
multipatch instruments.  Hopefully all the patches now in the collection
will sound good in every midi file they are used in.
