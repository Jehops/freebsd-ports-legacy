FX Toolbox plugin for XMMS.

People who enjoyed EaglePlayer II on Amiga, may remember the 8-bit Amplifier,
which featured a nice Surround effect. This plugin is an attempt to recreate
the same effect, plus some other goodies.

About the surround effect: it works like a cross echo. Some amount of the left
channel is delayed of some milliseconds, then added to the right channel, and
vice-versa.

* Provide a feeling of bigger room (that's what they said :).
* Reduce ear pressure when using headphones, especially with mods (try it to
  understand).
* Despite being nearly a stereo -> mono effect, you can still locate the sound
  in space, thanks to the delay.
