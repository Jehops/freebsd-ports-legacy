DeFX is a multi-effects processor plug-in. DeFX supports 6 types of effects,
grouped into 4 different modules.

  - Karaoke: removes the song's voices, trying to preserve the bass and drums.
  - Panning: smoothly selects between the two stereo channels.
  - Modulation: three classical effects: flange, phaser and chorus.
  - Reverberation: simulates the reverberation of a huge room.
