XMMS-EQ has been installed.

***WARNING***

This plugin may crash XMMS with the message "Segmentation fault" when enabling
or disabling it from the GUI.

The temporary solution for this is to edit the XMMS configuration file
directly. It is usually located at "~/.xmms/config". The section that
indicates the effect plugins to load is called "xmms". To enable or disable it
just add or remove the string "libeq.so" to the variable "enabled_eplugins".

For example (XMMS-EQ is enabled):

[xmms]

enabled_eplugins=libeq.so
