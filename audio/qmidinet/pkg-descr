QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives
MIDI data (ALSA Sequencer and/or JACK MIDI) over the network, using UDP/IP
multicast.  Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and
designed to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).

QmidiNet is free, open-source software, distributed under the terms of
