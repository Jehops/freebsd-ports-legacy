XMMS --- X Multimedia System. XMMS is a multimedia player based on the look of
Winamp. Currently it plays mpeg layer 1/2/3, wav, au, CD audio, etc.

The Vorbis plugin included here (if you don't specify WITHOUT_VORBIS) is the
one that is included in the XMMS distribution.  If you have the vorbis-xmms
port installed, the plugin from that port will be overwritten by this one.
