Ermixer is a command-line, ncurses, and Qt-GUI OSS audio mixer that looks
very nice in GUI mode, and can save and restore multiple named profiles. It
also has a command-line mode that makes it useful in scripts.

P.S. I have found the holy grail! Now I don't need to install kdemultimedia
just to get a bloody mixer!
