This is a binary port of the MBROLA speech synthesizer, which uses
"a time-domain algorithm with outstanding diphone smoothing
capabilities."  The audio/mbrola port is for i386 only and requires
FreeBSD 3.x compatibility; the linux-mbrola port is for alpha, i386,
ppc or sparc64 and requires Linux compatibility.
