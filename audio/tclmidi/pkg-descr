Tclmidi is language designed for creating and editing standard
MIDI files.  With the proper device interface it will also play
and record MIDI files.  Since tclmidi is a language supporting
function calls, recursion and conditionals, you can use these
features for editing, sequencing and writing complex scripts.
The brave might even want to try their hand at algorithmic
composition.
