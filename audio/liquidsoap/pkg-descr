Liquidsoap is the audio stream generator of the Savonet project, notably used
for generating the stream of netradios. It has tons of features, it's free and
it's open-source! Liquidsoap lets you to describe your streams in a powerful and
flexible way. Allowing arbitrarily deep-nested composition of streams, it gives
you more power than you need for creating an original netradio. But liquidsoap
is still very light and easy to use, in the Unix tradition of simple strong
components working together.
