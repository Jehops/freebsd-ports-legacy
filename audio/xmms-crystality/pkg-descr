This software consists of XMMS plugin and stdin/stdout plugin. It
was written for realtime remastering of sound from mp3 files. You
will need a reasonably good stereo and a good ear to notice quality
improvement, otherwise this is not for you. This plugin tries to
patch mp3 format flaws, not a poor audio hardware! Yes, you should
be able to hear well enough (sorry) - for some of my friends plugin
is a cool thing, while the others does not hear nothing but echo
and stereo expander (well, you will hear every effect if you set
it to the maximum, but it will not sound nice).
