************************************************************

The musicpd package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the MPD server, you need to create
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/mpd.conf out of
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/mpd.conf.sample
and add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:
  musicpd_enable="YES"

Then start the server with
  %%RC_DIR%%/musicpd%%RC_SUFX%% start
or reboot.

NOTE: The musicpd server is pretty useless without a
      client. You might want to install the mpc-port,
      too.
