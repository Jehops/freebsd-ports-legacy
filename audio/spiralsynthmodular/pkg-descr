SSM is an object orientated modular softsynth / sequencer / sampler.

You can use it in a fairly straight forward way to make tracks with,
or get very experimental. Audio or control data can be freely passed
between the plugins, there is no difference. Data can also be fed
back on itself for chaotic effects.
