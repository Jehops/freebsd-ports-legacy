Musica is a GTK based MIDI player.

- Plays MIDI files on Linux machines with an OSS sound card interface.
- GTK based user interface supporting drag-and-drop for easy file
  selection. Drag a MIDI file from the GNOME-ified Midnight Commander
  to Musica's drop pocket and it automatically loads the file.
- Tempo adjustment, Play a MIDI file up to four times faster or slower.
- Fast forward. Skip those dull passages in a MIDI file.
