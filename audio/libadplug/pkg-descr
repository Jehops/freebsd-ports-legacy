AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++ and released under the LGPL. AdPlug plays
sound data, originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, directly
from its original format on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the real
hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.

AdPlug itself is just the backend to many different audio player frontends,
which are also being developed here. There are plugins for popular audio
players, like Winamp and XMMS, as well as stand-alone players for many
different systems available.
