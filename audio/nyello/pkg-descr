nyello is a command-line XMMS2 client.

It aims at providing a high-level interface to the XMMS2 server, with a concise
and powerful interaction syntax. It boasts (or soon will boast) advanced
features, such as rich pattern expressions to efficiently browse your library,
smart completion of commands and custom song collections to organize your
library.

It can either run a single command or work like a shell (if started without
argument). As a command-line program, it is mostly targetted at Unix
power-users.
