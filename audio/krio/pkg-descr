KRio is a KDE graphical interface to the Rio utility developed by The
Snowblind Alliance, which can be used for uploading and downloading files
to/from the Diamond Rio, a popular portable MP3 player.

KRio can do the following:

* Upload/download files to/from Diamond Rio
* List Rio contents
* Delete files from Rio
* Initialise Rio

Note that while the Rio Manager software that comes with the player does not
allow you to upload non-MP3 files or download files from the device, it is
possible with this utility.   For non-MP3 files, Diamond Rio can be used as
a portable and robust file storage system.

KRio accesses the hardware directly, therefore it needs to be run as root.
You also need to know your parallel port's address - standard port addresses
on PCs are 0x378, 0x3BC and 0x278.
