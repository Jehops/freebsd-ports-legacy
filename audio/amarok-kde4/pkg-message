				ATTENTION:

In order to use certain devices (MTP, iPod, ..) through Amarok you need to be
able to mount USB devices as the user running Amarok. Read more on how to set
this up on FreeBSD here:

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/usb-disks.html

If you are not running a KDE4 desktop, you should consider installing the
x11/kdebase4-runtime and multimedia/phonon ports along with Amarok. You will
also need to pick a Phonon backend port (multimedia/phonon-xine or
multimedia/phonon-gstreamer). It has been reported that icons and audio will
not work properly without these additional ports.
