				ATTENTION:

In order to use certain devices (MTP, iPod, ..) through Amarok you need to be
able to mount USB devices as the user running Amarok. Read more on how to set
this up on FreeBSD here:

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/usb-disks.html

If you are not running a KDE4 desktop, you should consider installing the
x11-themes/kde4-icons-oxygen and multimedia/phonon-xine ports along with Amarok.
It has been reported that icons and audio will not work properly without
these additional ports.
