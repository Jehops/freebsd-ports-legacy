[ excerpt from developer's www site with modifications ]

The PicardTagger is the next generation MusicBrainzTagger. This
version of the tagging application is album oriented, as opposed
to track oriented as the old tagger was. This new application is
also cross platform, which means the same code runs on Windows as
well as Unix.

The PicardTagger will implement most of the MBTaggerImprovements.
