   Xtuner was developed to enable Linux and FreeBSD users to control
   Reveal's RA300 PC Radio Card and the AIMS Lab RadioTrack FM tuner
   card under the X Window System. It implements most all the features
   found with the software included from the manufacturer including
   presets, volume control, fine tuning, and timed auto on/off as well
   as tone control for bass and treble.
