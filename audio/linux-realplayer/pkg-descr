This is the Linux version of RealPlayer 5.0 from RealNetworks, the player
for RealAudio and RealVideo streaming broadcasts from the net. It can be
used as a standalone application, an external "helper" app from Netscape,
or a plugin in the Linux version of netscape.

Playing back video streams such as /usr/local/share/rvplayer5.0/welcome.rm
doesn't seem to work too well on my 4.0-CURRENT machine.

Due to license restrictions, this package must be manually downloaded
from:
