Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format contemporary to
MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike
the MPEG sponsored formats (and other proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2
and Windows' flavor of the month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to
the public domain.  All the technical details are published and documented, and
any software entity may make full use of the format without royalty or patent
concerns.

This package contains a plugin for the XMMS audio player, making it capable
of playing Vorbis-encoded files.
