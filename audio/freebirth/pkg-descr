Freebirth is a software bass synthesizer, step sequencer, and sample player.
It consists of a bass synthesizer vaguely 303ish but, 
it has much more sonic capability such as:

    * three oscillators (saw, sin , sqr)
    * phase offsets for each oscillator.
    * separate filter and amplitude envelopes.
    * separate tuning for each oscillator
    * two effects busses (reverb and delay)
