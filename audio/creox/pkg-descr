Creox is a real-time sound processor. You can plug your electric guitar or
any other musical instrument directly to the PC's sound card and start
experimenting with various sound effects.  Creox has a nice user-friendly
GUI, a preset support, a low-latency DSP engine, and each effect parameter
can be altered "on the fly".

As Creox is a JACK application, the output sound can be routed to the other
JACK-aware applications, and the audio input can be taken as the output from
the other JACK client.
