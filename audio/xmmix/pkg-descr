Xmmix is a sound mixer utility for the X Window System using the
OSF/Motif interface.  It requires the Unix Sound System (formerly
"VoxWare") sound driver by Hannu Savolainen (hannu@voxware.pp.fi).

The home page provides up-to-date information about the
current release version, online README file, FTP service to get
the software, an interactive form to send comments and
suggestions, and late-breaking announcements, if any.

I don't have hardware to test all the features, but it looks ok.
