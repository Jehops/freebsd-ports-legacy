A program to convert mpeg2 and ac3 into DivX with ac3 audio multiplexed
into it.

rebler is mainly intended for people to digitize their home handy cam videos
and preserve them online. For example tapes of weddings and other times that
one might wish to watch over and over. Though there may be other uses for
rebler than this.

Some examples of usage:

./rebler --input-ac3=music.ac3 --output-avi=snakes.avi \
--output-fourcc=DIV3 </tmp/silly-big-pgppipe-file

mpeg2dec -o pgmpipe -s /store/Jan2001Holiday.mpg | ./rebler \
--input-ac3=classic-music.ac3 --output-avi=Jan2001Holiday.avi \
--output-fourcc=DIV3
