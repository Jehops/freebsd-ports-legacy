This is a mod player which uses ncurses as a UI. It can play S3M, XM, MOD, 
MTM, STM, ULT, and UNI module types.
It uses the Open Sound System, and has features like sample interpolation,
random mod playing, and supports playing compressed modules. (Note: its
playing of compressed modules is OK, providing they don't have spaces in
their names...)
