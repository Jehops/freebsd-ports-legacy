MikMod is a portable modules player originally written by
of Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak) for DOS. It has 
subsequently been hacked by many hands and now runs on 
many platforms, this particular distribution intended
to compile fairly painlessly in a Unix (Linux) environment.
It uses the OSS /dev/dsp driver including in all recent 
kernels for output, and will also write wav files. 
Supported file formats include mod, stm, s3m, mtm, xm,
and it.  The player uses ncurses for console output and
supports transparent loading from gzip/pkzip/zoo archives
and the loading/saving of playlists.
Full source included, use of this library for music/sound 
effects in your own programs is encouraged!
