To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the emu10kx kernel
module, by doing

	# kldload snd_emu10kx

or adding

	snd_emu10kx_load="YES"

to your /boot/loader.conf (normally done automatically when installing
the port).

Note you should disable loading of the emu10k1 driver (this driver is for
the same hardware).
