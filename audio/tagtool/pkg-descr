Audio Tag Tool is a program to manage the information fields in MP3 and
Ogg Vorbis files, commonly called tags. Tag Tool can be used to edit tags
one by one, but the most useful features are the ability to easily tag or
rename hundreds of files at once, in any desired format.

The interface is arranged into two sections, with the list of available
files on the left and a set of tabs on the right. Each tab corresponds
to one of the main operations Audio Tag Tool can do:

    * Tag Editor
    * Tag Multiple Files
    * Clear Tags
    * Move/Rename Multiple Files
    * Create Playlists

The mass tag and mass rename features can handle filenames in any format
thanks to an easily configurable format template.
