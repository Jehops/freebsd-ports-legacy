AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player that supports different output systems
including OSS, Esound, NAS (Network Audio Server), Sparc, and SGI.

AlsaPlayer is heavily multi-threaded and has some very interesting features 
unique to Linux/Unix players such as full pitch control and the possibility
of playing music backwards.

Warning: AlsaPlayer consumes a lot of CPU cycles.
