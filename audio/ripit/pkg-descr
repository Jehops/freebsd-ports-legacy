ripit
-----

ripit is a small front-end program written in perl for ripping,
encoding and tagging MP3s or Ogg/Vorbis files from audio CDs. It
is a console program that needs no user intervention. It requires
p5-CDDB for CDDB access. A track ripper program and an encoder are
also needed, but are not installed automatically by this port,
since users' preferences vary.
