ripit can use a number of different programs to do the actual track
extraction and audio encoding. For ripit to be useful you need to
have at least one extract program and one encoder program installed.
However, since the choices are many and the users' needs and wants
are varied, none of these are automatically installed as part of
the ripit install. Remember to make sure you install the extractor(s)
and encoder(s) you want.
