oggsplit is a simple tool for splitting multiplexed (grouped or chained) Ogg
files into separate streams. It can thus be used to take apart two concatenated
streams (i.e. it undoes the process of cat file1.ogg file2.ogg > file3.ogg) or
to split two streams which are grouped, for example the video and audio streams
in a theora+vorbis file.
