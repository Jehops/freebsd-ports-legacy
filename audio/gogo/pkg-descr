gogo, 'Gogo no coder' (which means 'afternoon coder'), is very fast
MP3 encoder based on lame-3.23 which is optimized for MMX, K6-2 3DNow!
and Intel PentiumIII SSE. The latter is available when FreeBSD
supports SSE. (Linux supports it.)

*** DON'T OVERCLOCK YOUR K6-2 ***
Gogo heavily uses the 3DNow! unit that almost slesep in usual,
and the CPU becomes very hot even in normal clock.
So overclock may cause serious internal errors or crazy results.
Also, this may be same on PentiumIII.
