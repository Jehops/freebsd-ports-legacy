Gnomoradio is quickly becoming a fully-featured music player and peer
to peer file sharing system. Here is a quick outline of its current
features that more or less work:

	* Finds and plays mp3's and ogg's that are located on the
	  user's hard drive
	* Sorts songs in playlists, including search playlists for
	  songs that match a given criteria
	* Searches for, downloads and shares songs that are available
	  under a Creative Commons license
	* Recommends songs based on a user's listening preferences,
	  almost like a totally personalized radio broadcast
