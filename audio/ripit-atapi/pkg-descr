ripit
-----

ripit is a small front-end program written in perl for ripping,
encoding & tagging MP3s. It is a console program that needs no user
intervention. It requires cdd, bladeenc and xmcd (for CDDB access).

This version has been modified from the original 'ripit' port to use
CDD (/usr/ports/audio/cdd) to rip the tracks, for those of us (unfortunate
enough) who own ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

Note: This port also requires sox, the SOund eXchanger (/usr/ports/audio/sox)
as part of the ripping process.
