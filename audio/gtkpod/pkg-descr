gtkpod is a graphical user interface to upload and manage songs to your iPod
(1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, mini, nano, photo, and shuffle).  Its allows you to:

    * Read your existing iTunesDB (i.e. import the existing contents of
      your iPod including playcounts, ratings, and on-the-go playlists)
    * Add MP3, WAV, M4A (non-protected AAC), M4B (audio book), and podcast
      files (single files, directories or existing playlists) to the iPod
    * Browse the contents of your local harddisk by album/artist/genre
    * Create and modify playlists, including smart playlists
    * Choose the charset the ID3 tags are encoded in from within gtkpod
    * Extract tag information (artist, album, title, etc.) from the filename
    * Detect duplicates when adding songs (optional)
    * Remove and export tracks from your iPod
    * Modify ID3 tags, optionally updating the original file
    * Refresh ID3 tags from file (after changing tags in the original file)
    * Synchronize directories
    * Normalize the volume of your tracks (via mp3gain or the replay-gain tag)
    * Write the updated iTunesDB and added songs to your iPod
    * Work offline and synchronize your new playlists/songs with the iPod later
    * Export your korganizer/kaddressbook/thunderbird/evocalendar/evolution/
      webcalendar/... data to the iPod (scripts for other programs can be
      easily added)
