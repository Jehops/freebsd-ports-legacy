GKrellMSS displays a VU meter showing left and right channel audio levels
and also has a chart that shows combined left and right audio channels as
an oscilloscope trace.

There are two buttons to the left of the VU Meter which select an oscope
horizontal sweep speed ranging from 100 microseconds (usec) per division
to 50 milliseconds (msec) per division.  There are 5 horizontal divisions,
so a trace sweep time can range from 500 usec (1/2000 sec) to 250 msec
(1/4 sec).  The oscope trace is triggered by a positive zero crossing of
audio signal to give nice stable displays.

There is also a sensitivity level adjustment for the VU Meter and oscope
chart.  Use the mouse wheel to adjust, or left click and drag sensitivity
krell.
