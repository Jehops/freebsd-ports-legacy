Currently you need to manage your play list using the CLI client.
An example session would be:

1) Launch xmms2 daemon using xmms2-launcher command. You can analyze
	debugging output later in /tmp/xmms2.log.

2) Use the following commands to control xmms2:
	$ xmms2 add /path/to/some/files
	$ xmms2 add http://205.188.234.65:8022
	$ xmms2 list
	(now the playlist has stuff in it)

3) Start Euphoria with no options.

See http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se and xmms2(1) for further instructions.
