[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

This app is an audio converter for KDE. It lets you convert to and
from various audio file formats (at the moment: mp3, Ogg and wav),
mantaining, when possible, all the informations attached to those
files (title, author and so on). Its interface is thought as a
wizard (a serie of pages navigable through back-forward buttons),
so it should be quite simple to use, or so I hope.
