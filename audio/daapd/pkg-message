=================================================================

daapd has now been installed.

A sample configuration file has been placed at:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/daapd.conf.sample

You need to copy this to

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/daapd.conf

and edit it to suit your requirements. You must also add:

  daapd_enable="YES"

to /etc/rc.conf.

Documentation is installed at:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/README

Once configured, you can start daapd by running:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/daapd.sh start

daapd keeps its logfile in

  %%LOGDIR%%/daapd.log

To advertise the server, you can either use howl, or run net/mDNSResponder
with a command line like:

  mDNSResponderPosix -p 3689 -t _daap._tcp. -n `hostname`

Enjoy!
