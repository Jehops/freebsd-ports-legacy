DAP is a comprehensive audio sample editing and processing suite. DAP
currently supports AIFF and AIFF-C audio files, 8 or 16 bit resolution
and 1, 2 or 4 channels of audio data. Note however that on Linux and
Solaris, compressed AIFF-C files are not currently supported, only
non-compressed AIFF and AIFF-C files.

The package itself offers comprehensive editing, playback and recording
facilities including full time stretch resampling, manual data editing
and a reasonably complete DSP processing suite.
