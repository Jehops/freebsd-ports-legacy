CMake 2.8.12 support.

It does not make sense to add MYFLTK_LIBRARIES (which translates to
something like "-L/usr/local/lib -lfoo -lbar") to the link interface
library of a static library like libzynaddsubfx_gui.a.

Removing FLTK_LIBRARIES does not cause any problems either, as
GUI_LIBRARIES in src/CMakeLists.txt sets all the required GUI-related
libraries that need to be linked against the zynaddsubfx binary.
