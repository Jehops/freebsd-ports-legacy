You can load the module by typing (as root of course):

# kldload %%PREFIX%%/lib/au88x0/snd_au88X0.ko

where X is 1, 2 or 3 depending on which Auread chipset do you have - au8810,
au8820 or au8830 correspondingly.

Please note that you are also need to have a `snd_pcm.ko' module either already
loaded or placed into appropriate location for modules on your system (default
is /modules/ on 4-STABLE and /boot/kernel/ on 5-CURRENT). You can compile and
install snd_pcm by doing:

# cd /sys/modules/sound/pcm/ && make all install

Please also note that module for 4-STABLE system is untested, so please use it
with caution and if possible please report if it work for you or not to
Maxim Sobolev <sobomax@FreeBSD.org>.

Thanks and enjoy!
