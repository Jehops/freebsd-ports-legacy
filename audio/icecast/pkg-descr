~~~~~~~
Icecast provides nearly all the functionality of the Shoutcast Linux
server.  It will accept encoding streams from either iceplay or WinAmp.
It can also add itself to a directory server such as our own
icecast.linuxpower.org or Nullsoft's yp.shoutcast.com.  It does not yet 
support redirection of streams from other icecast servers, but soon will.
Command-line options are as follows (these can be obtained by running 
'icecast -h' as well):
