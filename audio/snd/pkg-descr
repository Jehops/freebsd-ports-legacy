Snd is a sound editor modeled loosely after Emacs and an old, sorely-missed
PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd. It can accommodate any number of sounds each
with any number of channels, and can be customized and extended using guile and
guile-gtk. It is under LGPL.

Included with it are some command-line utilities:
- sndinfo prints a description of a sound file.
- sndplay plays a sound file.
- sndrecord records sound from a microphone.
- audinfo describes the current state of the audio hardware.
- sndsine writes a mono NeXT/Sun sound file of a 440 Hz sine wave.

To build without the GUI, define WITHOUT_X.  To build without the
enhanced file-selection dialog, define WITHOUT_GTKEXTRA.  To omit
support for GUILE, define WITHOUT_GUILE.

Saving a selection from the Edit menu does not work.
