Snd is a sound editor modeled loosely after Emacs and an old, sorely-missed
PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd.  It can accommodate any number of sounds,
each with any number of channels, and can be customized and extended using
guile and guile-gtk.  It is under LGPL.

Included with it are some command-line utilities:
- snd-info (note:  renamed from sndinfo, for this FreeBSD port) prints a
  description of a sound file.
- sndplay plays a sound file.
- sndrecord records sound from a microphone.
- audinfo describes the current state of the audio hardware.
- sndsine writes a mono NeXT/Sun sound file of a 440 Hz sine wave.

To build without the GUI, define WITHOUT_X11.  To build without the enhanced
file-selection dialog, define WITHOUT_GTKEXTRA (this is implied by WITHOUT_X11).
To omit support for the GUILE or Ruby languages, or the Enlightened Sound
Daemon, define WITHOUT_GUILE, WITHOUT_RUBY or WITHOUT_ESD.

Saving a selection from the Edit menu does not work.
