Snow* is a Tcl/Tk GUI for the Snowblind Alliance 'rio' interface tool.
It wraps the rio command-line tool into a point-click-drag type of 
interface.


Snow* currently supports(or makes a pretty good passing leer at) all the
current SBA 'rio' tool commands, including single up/download, playlist
uploads & downloads, init, dir/TOC,delete. There should be no problem 
with any of the single or multi-file operations, although I don't entirely
rule out the possibility of the multi-select operations going a bit wonky.
