To use XMMS2Scrobbler write your username and password to the config file
like this:

        printf "user: foo\npassword: bar" > \
                ~/.xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/config

If you wish for XMMS2Scrobbler to start when you start xmms2d, make a
symbolic link from %%PREFIX%%/bin/xmms2-scrobbler to ~/.xmms2/startup.d/
