Ecawave is a simple graphical audio file editor. The user-interface is
based on Qt libraries, while almost all audio functionality is taken
directly from ecasound libraries. As ecawave is designed for editing
large audio files, all processing is done direct-to-disk. Simple
waveform caching is used to speed-up file operations. Ecawave supports
all audio file formats and effect algorithms provided by ecasound
libraries. This includes OSS, ALSA, aRts, over 20 file formats, over 30
effect types, LADPSA plugins and multi-operator effect presets.
