Bourne shell script RIPENC (short for "rip and encode"). This script
supports cdparanoia, cdda2wav and tosha (a FreeBSD ripper) for ripping
and bladeenc, 8hz-mp3 and l3enc for encoding. RIPENC also utilizes
CDDB lookups to name the songs as they are ripped.  Cda, which is
included in the XMCD package, must be used if you wish to utilize CDDB
naming. A manual naming option is also available.

This is version 0.6 (released Feb 27, 1999).
