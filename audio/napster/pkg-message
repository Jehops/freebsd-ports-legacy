Each user will have to make their own copy of ${PREFIX}/share/nap/nap.conf
into a directory of their choice, then run nap from that directory.

The first time you run nap, run it with the '-b' file to create an index
of your available MP3's.  You'll have to do this whenever you add new
MP3's to your archives as well.

If you already have a Napster account, just enter it in nap.conf.  Or,
to create an account, enter the desired username/password in nap.conf
and run `nap -m'.

For more documentation on this version of Napster, read the file
${PREFIX}/share/doc/nap.  For information about Napster in general,
check http://www.napster.com/ and http://www.napster.com/FAQ/

Have fun!
