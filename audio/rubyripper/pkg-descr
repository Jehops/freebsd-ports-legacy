Rubyripper is a digital audio extraction tool that uses cdparanoia error
correcting power and its own secure ripping algorithm to ensure that the
rip is done successfully and accurately.  It is very similar to and much
inspired by EAC for Windows, the golden standard of CD ripping software.

Some of the main features:

  - Graphical (GTK+2) and command line interfaces
  - Secure (accurate) ripping method
  - Editable FreeDB tag fetching
  - FLAC, Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, WAV format support; more codecs can be passed
  - Multiple codec encoding in one run
  - Drive offset support (http://www.accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm)
  - Playlist and cue sheet creation
  - Logfile with analysis of corrected and impossible to correct positions
  - MD5 sum for each track included in the logfile
