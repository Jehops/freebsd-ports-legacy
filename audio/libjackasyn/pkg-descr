libjackasyn is a library that allows you to use programs written for the OSS
sound API with the JACK audio server (jackit.sf.net). libjackasyn is a library
that can be used for two purposes.

First it can be loaded via the LD_PRELOAD variable, turning OSS applications
automatically into JACK-aware applications.

Second, it can be used to link against the program during build time, making it
trivial to turn an OSS aware sound application into a JACK aware sound
application in a short time.

libjackasyn got its name from the asynchronous manner in which it communicates
with the JACK server, which means by using libjackasyn you will introduce an
additional delay exactly the size of one JACK audiobuffer (1024 samples or 44
ms with the JACK default settings). This delay can be reduced by reducing the
JACK buffersize. It should not matter for sound generating applications, but
it might introduce phasing effects when doing sound processing.
