This is Festival 1.4.1 with OGIresLPC, the residual LPC synthesizer
plugin from the Center for Spoken Language Understanding at the
Oregon Health & Science University (formerly Oregon Graduate Institute
of Science & Technology).  The plugin "provides a new signal
processing engine and new voices" (it is needed by the abc, aec,
hvs, jph, mwm and tll voices) but is for non-commercial use only.

from the Festival authors:

	The Festival Speech Synthesis System is a general multi-lingual
	text-to-speech system for Unix platforms.  It is written
	in C++ and includes a Scheme-based scripting language.
	Included with Festival are lexicons and voices that together
	form a whole text-to-speech system.

For output via esd do:

	(Parameter.set 'Audio_Method 'esdaudio)
