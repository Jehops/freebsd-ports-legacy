This is a port for icecast. Icecast is a streaming mp3 audio server.
Icecast provides nearly all the functionality of the Shoutcast server.
It will accept encoding streams from either iceplay or WinAmp. It can
also add itself to a directory server such as our own
icecast.linuxpower.org or Nullsoft's yp.shoutcast.com.
