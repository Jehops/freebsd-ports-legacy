Cynthiune is a free software, romantic and extensible music player for
GNUstep and Mac OS X. Similar in look and feel to XMMS, it can read the
most-known sound file formats: MP3, Ogg, FLAC, Mod, XM, AIFF, WAV and more.
Very easy to use, it integrates well with the GNUstep desktop environment
and shows a nice example of a cross-platform OpenStep application.
