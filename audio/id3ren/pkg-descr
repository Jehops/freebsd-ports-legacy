id3 Renamer is used to rename batches of mpeg3 files by reading the
ID3 tag at the end of the file which contains the song name, artist,
album, year, and a comment.  The secondary function of id3 Renamer is
a tagger, which can create, modify, or remove ID3 tags.

If you have questions, comments, or bugs mail me at badcrc@tscnet.com.
