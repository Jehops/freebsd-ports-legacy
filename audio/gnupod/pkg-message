gnuPod < 0.25 had a bad typo:
the 'genere=' tag should be (of course) 'genre='.
It's corrected in gnuPod 0.25, but if you used the
'Genre' tag in older versions you'll have to do this
(To correct your GNUtunesDB)

1) Mount your iPod
2) Run: tunes2pod -m $IPOD_MOUNTPOINT
(Make sure to run tunes2pod from gnupod 0.25!)

This will re-parse your iTunesDB and create a
GNUtunesDB without the typo
