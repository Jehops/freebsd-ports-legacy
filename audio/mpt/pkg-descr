Mike's Playlist Thingie (working title)

You know what is bad about playlists? You set them all up, and
everything seems great, but then you go and get a couple hundred
new mp3s. Now you have to go update all your playlists. If you've
got 10 playlists and 100 new songs, that's 1000 decisions you have
to make. Yuck.

With MPT, playlists are no longer just static catalogs, pointing
to songs on your hard drive. They're more like radio stations, where
each one has a set of rules that define, in general, what kind of
music should be played. Like procmail for music.
