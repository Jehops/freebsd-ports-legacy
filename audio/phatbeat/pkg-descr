In a nutshell, PhatBeat is a cross-platform (Linux and Windows) beat
counter for use by collectors, producers, DJs, and others interested
in beat-oriented music. For now it requires users to tap in the beat
during listening, after which it calculates and displays the track's
BPM and the size of a measure in seconds.
