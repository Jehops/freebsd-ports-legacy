This plugin looks at the songs before and after the current song in
the playlist and determines whether an album is playing or if random
tracks are playing. After that determination, it sets the player's
transition behaviour (crossfade, fade, etc) appropriately. The
transition behaviour for the album/random/default cases can be changed
by modifying the values of the four global variables at the top of
Transitions.pm. There is also a user configurable section for
excluding specific genres from being processed for album/random
detection. In these cases, the 'default' transition preference will be
used (not in v1.5).
