The python intelligent mp3 player can be used to make your mp3 listening
experience above what you currently receive with random play.  By using its
ability to track and rank mp3s based on listener approval or disapproval
it will tend to play the songs you like more than the ones you don't.

Finally everything can be tossed into a bitbucket of a random playlist.
