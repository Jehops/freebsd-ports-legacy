This port makes mp3 creation easy, by ripping tracks from
CD to WAV files and Encoding them to mp3 automatically.

It is basically a front-end (but VERY easy to use) to
dagrab and bladeenc, which must be installed in your
path.

These programs and further documentation are available
from the website.
