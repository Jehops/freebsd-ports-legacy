ezstream is a command line utility which is a improved version 
of the old "shout" utility. It enables you to stream mp3 or vorbis
files to an icecast server without reencoding and thus requires
very little CPU. ezstream is controlled via a XML config file.
ezstream can stream mp3 and ogg vorbis files as well as reading
from stdin. ID3v1 tags are supported in mp3 files and all ogg
vorbis tags are propagated as metadata as well.
