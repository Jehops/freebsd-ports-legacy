ARPWATCH 2.0

This directory contains source code for arpwatch and arpsnmp, tools
that monitors ethernet activity and maintain a database of ethernet/ip
address pairings. It also reports certain changes via email.

Arpsnmp has the same database features of arpwatch but relies on an
external agent to collect the arp data. This distribution contains a
script, arpfetch, that uses snmpwalk from the CMU SNMP package. This
package is available from:

	ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/snmp-dist/cmu-snmp*.tar.Z

It should be trivial to adaptive the output of any snmp query program
for use with arpsnmp.

Please send bugs and comments to arpwatch@ee.lbl.gov.
