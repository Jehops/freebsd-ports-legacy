Knowlan is ARP-based Local Area Network IP and MAC Address Extractor.
It sends ARP REQUEST packets to the LAN and waits for ARP REPLY packets 
from network nodes that are up, producing a table of currently 
active IP and MAC addresses. 
Knowlan uses libpcap and libnet libraries for easy source code review
and maintenance.
