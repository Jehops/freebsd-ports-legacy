dhcp-agent is a suite, or a set of tools, that allow a UNIX host to make use
of the Dynamic Host Configuration protocol.

Currently the suite is packaged with the following tools:
    * dhcp-client : A highly configurable and extendable DHCP client.
    * dhcp-sniff : A command line DHCP sniffer.

In good time the suite will also be packaged with:
    * dhcp-server : A configurable and extendable DHCP server.
    * dhcp-relay : A DHCP relay agent.

Under FreeBSD the client will make use of two bpf devices. This is because
of a limitation in dnet. If you run out of bpf devices you may need to
compile a kernel with more bpf devices.
