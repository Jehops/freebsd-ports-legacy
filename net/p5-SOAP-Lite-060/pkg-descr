SOAP::Lite is a collection of Perl modules which provides a 
simple and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol 
(SOAP) both on client and server side.

This version is maintained because many systems still require functionality
in 0.60, which has become broken/deprecated in later versions.
