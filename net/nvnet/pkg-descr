This port contains a driver for the NVIDIA nForce MCP Ethernet adapter.
It contains a wrapper that replaces the Linux nvnet.c, and links against
the Linux binary only object file (nvenetlib.o) included from the NVIDIA
driver source distribution.

This should work on all nForce and nForce2 based motherboards that have
the onboard MCP MAC enabled.
