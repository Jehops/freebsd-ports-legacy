This is a port of qadsl, a small utility to login on the Telia AB ADSL
service. It also works fine with COMHEM Cable internet. It has
features like keep-alive daemon, login/logout functions. The
keep-alive daemon can be configured to either login or to ping your
login-server after a chosen delay in minutes.
