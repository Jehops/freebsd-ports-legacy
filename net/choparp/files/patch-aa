+.Sh NAME
+.Nm choparp
+.Nd cheap and omitted proxy arp
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm chpoarp
+.Ar if_name mac_addr net_addr net_mask
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Pp
+.Nm choparp 
+is a easy-to-use proxy arp daemon.
+It watches arp request packets visible on the interface specified by argument
+.Ar if_name ,
+and sends proxy arp reply to the sender if the arp request queries the
+MAC address (ethernet hardware address) for the network speicified by
+.Ar net_addr
+and
+.Ar net_mask .
+.Pp
+.Ar mac_addr
+has to be the MAC address assigned to the interface
+.Ar if_name .
+The format of
+.Ar mac_addr
+must be 6 bytes of hexadecimal value, separated by colons (":") ;
+for example, "00:00:01:01:14:46".
+The format of
+.Ar net_addr
+and
+.Ar net_mask
+must be dot notation (say, 133.138.1.134) or 32bit hexadecimal value
+starting with "0x" (say, 0x858a0186).
+.Sh EXAMPLES
+If you have network interface "ne0" with MAC address "00:00:01:01:14:16",
+and would like to send proxy arp reply for 192.168.0.64/26,
+the argument would be as follows:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+choparp ne0 00:00:01:01:14:46 192.168.0.64 255.255.255.192
+.Ed
+.Sh BUGS
+Supports ethernet interfaces only.
+Handles single interface at a time.
+(you can start multiple
+.Nm choparp
+for multiple interfaces, though)
+MAC address should be automatically detected.
