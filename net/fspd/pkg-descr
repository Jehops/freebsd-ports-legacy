This is a server daemon for FSP, the File Service Protocol.  With
it, you can offer files to "anonymous" visitors.  Bandwidth can
easily be limited.
 
Since a service contact port (well-known port) for FSP has not been
assigned by IANA (per RFC 1700), you must choose one yourself when
configuring fspd.  Edit the example.conf file and place it in
${LOCALBASE}/etc/fspd.conf (typically LOCALBASE is set to /usr/local).
You can run fspd from inetd or stand-alone.
