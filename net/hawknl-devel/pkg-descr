HawkNL is a free, open source, game oriented network API released under the GNU
Library General Public License (LGPL). HawkNL (NL) is a fairly low level API, a
wrapper over Berkeley/Unix Sockets and Winsock. 

But NL also provides other features including support for many OSs, groups of 
sockets, socket statistics, high accuracy timer, CRC functions, macros to read 
and write data to packets with endian conversion, and support for multiple 
network transports. 

NL has been tested on Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE, Linux, Solaris, IRIX, AIX, 
BSDs, Mac OSX.
