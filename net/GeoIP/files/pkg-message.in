GeoIP does not ship with the actual data files. You must download
them yourself! To obtain the free database, run:
# %%PREFIX%%/bin/geoipupdate.sh

If you are using the free database, you will need to create some
symlinks for the geoiplookup tools, as described in
https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c/blob/master/NEWS.md
