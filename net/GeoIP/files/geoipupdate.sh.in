===============================================================
Maxmind no longer provides the legacy GeoIP databases, and have
removed the databases from their servers entirely.

If a port has an OPTION that supports GeoIP 2 (via
net/libmaxminddb), please switch to that and use geoipupdate
(net/geoipupdate) to fetch the GeoIP 2 databases.
