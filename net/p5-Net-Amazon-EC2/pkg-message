You need to do some things before you can use the Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud:

1) Visit http://aws.amazon.com/ to create an Amazon AWS account.

2) Obtain your AWS public key and secret key to use with the EC2 service.

3) Create AMIs and use them as needed.

   DISCLAIMER: No one but you is responsible for paying Amazon to use
               the EC2 service. EC2 does not have a free sandbox area,
               so be aware how much money you are spending to use the
               service.
