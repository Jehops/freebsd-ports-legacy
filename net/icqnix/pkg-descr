ICQnix is an ICQ client for the X Window System for UNIX based PCs, designed
to look and feel as much like the Mirabilis ICQ client as possible. ICQnix
has been developed and tested on Linux, and theoretically should work on 
other variants of UNIX. It uses the Qt widget set and was originally based on
Licq v0.41 by Graham Roff. 

Some of it's features include: 

o Send and Receive Online/Offline messages 
o Send and Receive Online/Offline URLs 
o Peer to Peer Chat 
o Message History 
o Visible/Invisible lists 
o ICQ Search 
o View Basic User Info 
o Event sounds 
o X-based user installation 
o Closely resembles the Windows ICQ interface
