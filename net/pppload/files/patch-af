+PPPLoad is designed to display the current throughput of a particular
+PPP link in a format that is similar to xload. Written by Sean Vyain. 
+
+This is a FreeBSD port of the linux program called pppload, available at
+http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/ppp/pppload-1.0.tar.gz
+
+Original program homepage at:
+http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/1029/pppload.html
+
+I have modified the FreeBSD port to be able to show the throughput of
+any network device that will work with netstat, e.g. tun, ppp, ed,
+etc.  I just wanted a program to nicely display throughput
+statistics for the tun device.
+
+ Examples of usage:
+For tun0 (tun is the default device,0 is the default link number):
+% pppload &
+
+For first ne2000 clone:
+% pppload -device ed -link 0 &
+
+for ppp2:
+% pppload -device ppp -link 2 &
+
+BUGS
+Command line is awkward with -device and -link.
+
+Can't detect whether the network device is up or not, so any command
+line options like -cmd -percmd -retry probably don't work.  This is
+different that the original linux version.
+
+Keeps track of all packets network device has ever used, even if it
+has gone down then up again.  This is also different than the linux
+version. 
+
+Requires awk, grep, and netstat to get the data.  Very short polling
+time are definitely not recommended.
+
+Network interface names are limited to a total of 4 characters or less
+at the moment, e.g. ppp0 ed3 ze1.
+
+
+Documentation of this FreeBSD port is not complete.
