This is the lanbrowsing utility package for KDE. It contains:

- The lan:/ kioslave for Konqueror which lets you browse
  several services on your local network like http, ftp, smb and nfs.

- The LISa daemon, the backend for the lan:/ kioslave which scans your network
  for hosts and services.

- A wizard to setup the LISa daemon.
