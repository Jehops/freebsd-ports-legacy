 You need a Google-provided license key to use these services.
 Go http://www.google.com/apis/ to get one. This module will look
 in several places (in this order) for the license key:

  - the module-level LICENSE_KEY variable
  - an environment variable called GOOGLE_LICENSE_KEY
  - a file called ".googlekey" in the current directory
  - a file called ".googlekey" in your home directory
