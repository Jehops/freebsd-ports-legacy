If you want to use samba ports,

1. Copy /usr/local/etc/smb.conf.default to /usr/local/etc/smb.conf, and edit
   it.
2. Copy /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh.sample to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh
3. Type /usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh or reboot.

See document files in /usr/local/share/doc/samba and example config files in
/usr/local/share/examples/samba for details.

FreeBSD Samba ports for localization and encrypt passwords support are
no longer provided because these supports have been integrated into
the original distribution since 1.9.18.  If you're Western European or
Japanese Windows users, please set "client code page" parameter in
smb.conf (1.9.18 does not support Chinese Windows).  See
smb.conf.sample for details.  If you want to use NT4+SP3 or
Win95+updates clients, set "encrypt passwords" parameter to yes and
use smbpasswd [username] to use /usr/local/private/smbpasswd for
authentication.
