Mantissa is an application server.

It provides integration between the Axiom Project object database, and the 
Twisted Framework, as well as web user-interface utilities.

The goal of Mantissa is to provide a common platform that open-source 
contributors can use to help us build customized additions to the Divmod 
service.
