pysmb is an experimental SMB/CIFS library written in Python.
The library has been tested to be able to connect Win 98 SE and Samba 2.0
machines, and upload/download files to and from these machines. Unfortunately,
some users have reported that pysmb is unable to work with Windows 2000 and
Windows XP.

Modules
    smb - Contains all the SMB operations and constants 
    nmb - Contains some of the NetBIOS over TCP/IP operations which is
          neccessary for the smb module to operate.
