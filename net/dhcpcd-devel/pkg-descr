dhcpcd is a DHCP/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 client.
It can also act as a network manager, responding to new interfaces,
listening for carrier up/down events and managing routes.

dhcpcd-9 includes privilege separation; operations which do not require
root privileges are run in a chroot (/var/chroot/dhcpcd) as the
unprivileged user _dhcp.

This is an experimental version for testing purposes.
