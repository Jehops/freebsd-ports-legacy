dhcpcd is a DHCP/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 client.
It can also act as a network manager, responding to new interfaces,
listening for carrier up/down events and managing routes.

dhcpcd-9 introduces a number of security improvements:
- privilege separation; operations which do not require root privileges
  are run in a chroot /var/chroot/dhcpcd as the unprivileged user _dhcp
- capsicumized all network facing processes; all fd's in network facing
  processes are fully limited

This is an experimental version for testing purposes.
