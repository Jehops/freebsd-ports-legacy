CVSup is a software package for distributing and updating collections
of files across a network.  CVSup is specifically tailored to
distributing CVS repositories.  By taking advantage of the special
properties of the files contained in CVS repositories, CVSup is
able to perform updates much faster than traditional systems.  It
is especially valuable for people with slow Internet connections.
