Nam is a Tcl/TK based animation tool for viewing network simulation
traces and real world packet traces. It supports topology layout,
packet level animation, and various data inspection tools.
 
Nam began at LBL. It has evolved substantially over the past few
years. The nam development effort was an ongoing collaboration with
the VINT project. Currently, it is being developed at ISI as part of
the SAMAN and Conser projects.
