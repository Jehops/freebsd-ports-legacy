Corkscrew is a simple utility to help tunnel SSH connections through
web proxies.

Add the following line to your ~/.ssh/config file (replacing HOST and
PORT with your web proxy settings):
	ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/corkscrew HOST -p PORT %h %p

Corkscrew is known to work with the Gauntlet and CacheFlow proxies.
