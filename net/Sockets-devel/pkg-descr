This is a GPL licensed C++ class library wrapping the berkeley
sockets C API, and therefore works on most unixes and also win32.
Features include, but are not limited to, SSL support, IPv6 support,
tcp and udp sockets, encrypted tcp, http protocol, highly customizable
error handling. Testing has been done on Linux and Windows 2000,
and to some part on Solaris and Mac OS X.
