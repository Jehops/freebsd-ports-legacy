kio_fish is a kioslave for KDE 2.0 that lets you view and manipulate
your remote files using just a simple shell account and some standard
unix commands on the remote machine. You get full filesystem access
without setting up a server - no NFS, Samba, ... needed.

Usage is really simple: open up a konqueror window (or use the Alt-F2
dialog) and type 'fish://user@remote.machi.ne'. kio_fish will ask you
for the password, if any is needed, and you will start out in your
home directory. Now you can do everything you do on your local hard
disk.
