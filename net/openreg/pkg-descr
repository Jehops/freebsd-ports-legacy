OpenReg is an implementation of a domain registry, such as might be
used by top-level domain operators to manage the delegation of domains
in a "shared registry" environment. OpenReg:

*) supports the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), the IETF
   standards-track protocol for interaction between registries and
   registrars;
 
*) is designed and debugged as a distributed multi-process system;
 
*) supports PostgreSQL and is designed to accommodate to very large registries;
 
*) publishes zone files to be served using BIND;
 
*) gathers comprehensive profiling and load statistics;
 
*) is published as free software, under a BSD-style licence.
