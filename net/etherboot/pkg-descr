This code was originaly from FreeBSD and then the Linux folks greatly
enhanced its functionality and capabilities.  It tftp's the kernel 
and boots it.  It also has a menu capability.

.rom & .com images are built in work/etherboot/src-32.  Edit "Config"
in that directory for more features.

Note this is a memory corruption issue when I pre-populate the bootinfo
structure I need to look at it more.
