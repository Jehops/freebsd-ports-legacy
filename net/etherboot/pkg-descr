This code was originaly from FreeBSD and then the Linux folks greatly
enhanced its functionality and capabilities. It produces ROM-able
code to boot ELF/aout kernels over NFS or TFTP. It also includes
boot loaders to load the ROM images from raw floppy or hard disks,
or DOS disks.

There are different ROM images for different network cards
(many are supported). They are built in work/etherboot/src/bin32.

Edit "Config" in work/etherboot/src directory for more features,
default is to boot ELF kernels over NFS.

To make a floppy image do
	cd work/etherboot/src ; gmake bin32/<device.fd0
.COM images are made via  gmake bin32/<device type>.com .
