This code was originaly from FreeBSD and then the Linux folks greatly
enhanced its functionality and capabilities.  It tftp's the kernel 
and boots it.  It also has a menu capability.  The only bad part is
that it needs to be built in an Linux environment and needs my patch
to linux_devel to run "brandelf" on static executables.  Without this
patch the intermediate static files will not run.

.rom & .com images are built in work/etherboot/src-32.  Edit "Config"
in that directory for more features.

Note this is a memory corruption issue when I pre-populate the bootinfo
structure I need to look at it more.

Here is a sample dhcpd.conf entry for isc-dhcp.

server-identifier 192.168.1.31;

group {
	subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	   range dynamic-bootp 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.19;
	   dynamic-bootp-lease-length 3600;
	   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
	   option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
	   option routers 192.168.1.30;
	   option root-path "/crab/home1/usr/upgrade";


         host current3 {
           hardware ethernet 0:a0:c9:c7:e1:6f;
           fixed-address 192.168.1.25;
           option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
           option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
           option routers 192.168.1.30;
           option root-path "192.168.1.31:/crab/home1/usr/current";
	   option option-128 "192.168.1.31:/crab/home1/usr/current";
#	   option option-132 00:00:90:40;
	   option option-132 00:00:90:00;  # howto boot flags
	   option option-176 3;
	   option option-160 "timeout=30:default=206:";
	   option option-192 "BSD:::/tftpboot/kernel";
	   option option-193 "Load:::/tftpboot/kernel.load";
	   option option-195 "MiniDOS:::/tftpboot/pcdr";
	   option option-206 "ELF:::tftpboot/kernel.elf";
         }
	}
}
