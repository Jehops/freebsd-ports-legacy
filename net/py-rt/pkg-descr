The Python Routeing Toolkit (`PyRT') enables routeing information in a
network to be collected. The purpose of this software is to enable routeing
information in a network to be collected. This package currently supports
BGPv4 and ISIS and will dump MRTD format files. It also supports parsing of
MRTD TABLE_DUMP files (as available from, eg., RouteViews and RIPE/RIS). A
number of utilities for manipulating these dumps are also provided.
