EUDC is a user-friendly e-lisp client interface to directory servers running
various protocols:

1) LDAP: Lightweight Directory Protocol
2) CCSO: white pages directory system also known as PH/QI (from its standard
   client and server names).
3) BBDB: Big Brother's Insiduous Database (BBDB is a local directory database)

EUDC lets you query your corporate directory server for information such as
phone numbers and office locations. It lets you also query public servers
such as Four11 or BigFoot to complete email addresses directly from the
server while composing email messages in VM, Gnus, Rmail,...
