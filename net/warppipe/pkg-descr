Warp Pipe is free software that runs on your PC or Mac and is
available for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and BSD operating systems.
While running on your PC or Mac, Warp Pipe allows you to play
LAN-enabled Nintendo GameCube games over the Internet with other
GameCube gamers. While Warp Pipe software runs on your PC or Mac,
it talks to the GameCube connected on the same network, allowing
the GameCube to communicate with other GameCubes over the Internet.
