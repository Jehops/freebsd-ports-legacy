CPhone is a H323 Video Conferencing Program compatible with other
H323 video conferencing programs including Microsoft NetMeeting,
OhPhone and GnomeMeeting.

CPhone supports full duplex audio and bi-directional video.
It requires a full duplex sound card for audio support
and a Bt848/878 based video card (using the bktr driver) is required if you
want to send video.

It uses the OpenH323 and PWLib libraries (see ports/net/openh323)
