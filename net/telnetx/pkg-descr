Telnetx was developed by WIDE/WPNC Working Group.  Telnetx supports
several binary file transfer protocols which are provided by some of
major commercial online services.  Zmodem, B plus, transit and kermit
are supported by telnetx.  Telnetx calls external transfer programs to
do the transfer and thus transfer functions are independent from
telnetx itself.  The user can also specify other external programs to
perform file transfer.
