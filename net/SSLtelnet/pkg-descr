This program suports both certification and cryptogoraphic with using SSL.

If you do not have certification (/usr/local/certs/telnet.pem) provided by CA, 
this port make dummy certification. Of cource it is useless to certify but you
can use SSL telnet/telnetd in encryption only mode with it.

You must edit /etc/inetd.conf to make SSL telnetd available. Some examples
below:

1. Accept both normail telnet client and SSL telnet client.

telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/libexec/telnetd	telnetd 

2. Accpet only SSL encrypted client.

telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/libexec/telnetd	telnetd -z secure

3. Accept only SSL certificated client.

telnet	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/libexec/telnetd	telnetd -a valid
