BOINC's boinc-client is now installed.  You now need to register
with and install one or more projects.

Refer to the BOINC web page at
	http://boinc.berkeley.edu/
for a list of projects and refer to each of their sites for info
on how to register with them and how to use them on FreeBSD.
Note that not all projects support FreeBSD; some do, some let
you download the client source code to install yourself, and some
don't work on FreeBSD at all.

SETI@HOME for FreeBSD is available in port astro/boinc-setiathome.
