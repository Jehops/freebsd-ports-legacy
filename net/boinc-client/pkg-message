The BOINC client is now installed.  You now need to register with
and install one or more projects.

Refer to the BOINC web page at:
	http://boinc.berkeley.edu/
for a list of projects and refer to each of their sites for info
on how to register with them and how to use them on FreeBSD.
Note that not all projects support FreeBSD; some do, some let
you download the client source code to install yourself, and some
don't work on FreeBSD at all.

SETI@HOME for FreeBSD is available in port astro/boinc-setiathome.

Einstein@Home will soon be available as a binary port for
	FreeBSD/i386 users; it may also be available as an
	automatic BOINC download.

Read the "boinc" man page for more info on running BOINC and
attaching projects.

This version of the port includes the "boincmgr" GUI management
interface and support for the client application status screens.
Read the "boincmgr" man page for info on setting up your DISPLAY
environment variable and xhost access permissions to use this.
NB: Due to bugs in the x11-toolkits/wxgtk port on FreeBSD 4.x/alpha
boincmgr may not work on that platform.
