boinc \- client for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing
.SH SYNOPSIS
boinc [ options ]
.PP

.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I boinc
is the client for the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network
Computing (BOINC) service.  It is used by projects such as SETI@HOME
and ClimatePredictor to offer your spare CPU cycles to such projects.
BOINC allows you to configure one or more projects to which you offer
your spare CPU cycles for their computations.
.PP
BOINC is a scheduler; you configure projects under BOINC and BOINC
then runs each one according to what percentage of time you have
specified for that project.
When a project is run, BOINC runs the project's client program to
download computational work units from the project, then perform the
work unit computation, and finally upload the results back to the
project.  If no work is available for one of your projects, BOINC
will run another of your projects.
.PP
BOINC runs project clients at low priority, with an
.IR idprio (1)
value of 31, to ensure that as soon as you need your computer for
any other work, BOINC projects stop so that you are not delayed
by them.
.PP
After choosing which projects to participate in, you must register
with each on the project's website.  You can find out about BOINC
projects on the BOINC website.  Upon registering with a project,
you will receive an account ID for the project.
Run
.I "boinc -attach_project"
to add new projects to your BOINC configuration using the project
URL and your account ID.
Depending on what operating system platforms the project supports
you may be able to immediately start the project or you may need to
download the project client's source code and compile it.  For
further information, see the BOINC web site and the project's own
website.  Some projects are already available as FreeBSD ports
(e.g., SETI@HOME in port astro/boinc-setiathome).  Not all projects
support FreeBSD and some do not make their client's source code
available.  In such cases, you will not be able to participate in
that project from FreeBSD.
.PP
Running
.I boinc
with no arguments starts the service and any configured projects.
.PP
You can edit both BOINC general preferences and project-specific
preferences on the website of any BOINC projects which you are
registered with.  Preferences will take effect next time BOINC
contacts that project's server, e.g., to download more work or
to upload results.
.PP
The user
.I %%BOINC_USER%%
needs to exist; all invocations of boinc will run as this
user.  If you want users other than root to be able to start
BOINC, set a password on this account so that anyone can run
.I boinc_client
and supply the password.
.PP
IMPORTANT NOTE:  The project clients are programs running
on your computer with full access (as the user
.IR %%BOINC_USER%% )
to all files and resources of your computer.  Before running any
project client, you should establish for yourself that the
program is trustworthy and will not abuse your computer.  The
BOINC scheduler does not restrict clients in any way other than to
run them as the user
.IR %%BOINC_USER%% .
.SH "GRAPHICAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE"
Running
.I "boinc -allow_remote_gui_rpc"
allows the
.I boincmgr
graphical management interface to interact with the client.
.PP
The
.I boincmgr
program provides a graphical management interface to the core
boinc.  After
.I boinc
has been started, run
.I boincmgr
to add new projects, to see the status of existing projects'
work units, and to control the client.
.PP
.I boincmgr
can also be used to monitor and manage BOINC clients on other
hosts.
.PP
On the
.I Work
tab, there is a
.I "Show graphics"
button which displays a graphical status window from the client
application.
For the
.I "Show graphics"
option to have effect, it must be understood that it is the
client application that opens up the status window.  The value
of the
.I DISPLAY
environment variable of the
.I boincmgr
process is passed to the BOINC core and then to the client
application, and must have meaning to that client.  A value
of
.I ":0.0"
will work for local clients, but for clients on remote hosts,
a value such as
.I "hostname:0.0"
or
.I "hostname.domain.com:0.0"
will be needed.
In addition, the local X-server host access permissions must
allow access to the display by the client.
For local clients, the simplest way to allow this is to use
.IR xhost (1),
e.g.,
.IR "xhost\ +local:" .
.PP
Full documentation of
.I boincmgr
is not provided here, but may be added in a future release.
.SH "STARTING BOINC AT BOOT TIME"
The
.I %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/boinc.sh
script is run automatically at system boot time.
Several variables can be set in
.I %%RC_SUBR%%
to control the BOINC client's behavior.
.IP boinc_enable
set to
.I "YES"
to start BOINC at boot time
.IP boinc_flags
passed to the BOINC client, e.g.,
.I boinc_flags="-allow_remote_gui_rpc"
to allow access from the
.I boincmgr
graphical management interface.
.SH OPTIONS
The command-line client has the following command-line options:
.IP -attach_project
Attach this computer to a new project.
You must have an account with that project.
You will be asked for the project URL and the account ID.
.IP -show_projects
Print a list of projects to which this computer is attached.
.IP -detach_project URL
Detach this computer from a project.
.IP -reset_project URL
Clear pending work for a project.
Use this if there is a problem that is preventing
your computer from working.
.IP -update_prefs URL
Contact a project's server to obtain new preferences.
This will also report completed results
and get new work if needed.
.IP -return_results_immediately
Contact scheduler as soon as any result done.
.IP -run_cpu_benchmarks
Run CPU benchmarks.
Do this if you have modified your computer's hardware.
.IP -check_all_logins
If 'run if user active' preference is off,
check for input activity on all current logins;
default is to check only local mouse/keyboard
.IP -exit_when_idle
Get, process and report work, then exit.
.IP -redirectio
Redirect stdout and stderr to log files.
.IP -allow_remote_gui_rpc
Allow GUI RPCs from remote hosts
.IP -help
Show client options.
.IP -version
Show client version.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The command-line client has the following optional environment variables:
.IP HTTP_PROXY
URL of HTTP proxy
.IP HTTP_USER_NAME
User name for proxy authentication
.IP HTTP_USER_PASSWD
Password for proxy authentication
.IP SOCKS4_SERVER
URL of SOCKS 4 server
.IP SOCKS5_SERVER
URL of SOCKS 5 server
.IP SOCKS5_USER
User name for SOCKS authentication
.IP SOCKS5_PASSWD
Password for SOCKS authentication
.SH FILES
.IP %%BOINC_HOME%%
default home directory for
.I %%BOINC_USER%%
user
.IP %%BOINC_HOME%%/*
boinc configuration files
.IP %%BOINC_HOME%%/projects/*
BOINC projects
.IP %%BOINC_HOME%%/projects/*/*
BOINC project work unit files
.SH BUGS
Suspending
.I boinc
using ^Z works, but resuming using
.I fg
or
.I bg
does not resume any client processes (e.g., SETI).  These need to be
restarted using
.I "kill -CONT"
for each process.
.PP
Placing files in %%BOINC_HOME%% or its subdirectories can cause work
to fail as those files will be counted in disk usage limit checks.  In
addition to configurable overall disk usage limits, each client may
further restrict the size of its project or slot directories.
.PP
On a hyperthreadded processor, performance may be limited due to shared
use of processor modules such as the FPU.
