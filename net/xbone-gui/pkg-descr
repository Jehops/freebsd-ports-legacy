This port installs the GUI frontend for the XBone. The GUI is written
as a set of XML pages and required Apache web server to run. The
following is a detailed description of the XBone taken from XBone
port.

The X-Bone dynamically deploys and manages Internet overlays to reduce
configuration effort and increase network component sharing. The
X-Bone discovers, configures, and monitors network resources to create
overlays over existing IP networks. Overlays are useful for deploying
overlapping virtual networks on shared infrastructure and for
simplifying topology.

The X-Bone's two-layer IP in IP tunneled overlays support existing
applications and unmodified routing, multicast, and DNS services in
unmodified host operating systems. This two-layer scheme uniquely
supports node revisitation and recursive overlays, which is critical
for fault tolerance and dynamic relocation. The X-Bone uses multicast
to simplify resource discovery, and provides secure deployment as well
as secure overlays (VPNs).
