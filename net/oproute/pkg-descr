Everyone knows that no one can agree on a system of metrics for
measuring general performance of the Internet. It's one of these
horrible religious issues that no matter how hard we try, we just
can't reach a happy middle ground.

The purpose of OpRoute is to attempt to establish a *generalized*
measurement system which takes into account all of the factors that
are usually considered to be important when it comes to performance.
Specifically:

   - Packet Loss 
   - Latency 
   - Layer 3 Hops 
   - AS Hops 
   - NAP Hops 
   - Throughput
