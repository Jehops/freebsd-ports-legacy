The ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides
a freely redistributable reference implementation of all aspects
of the DHCP protocol, through a suite of DHCP tools:

    * A DHCP server
    * A DHCP client
    * A DHCP relay agent

Version 3, Beta 2 of the ISC DHCP Distribution includes the following
features that are new since version 2.0:

    * DHCP Failover Protocol support 
    * OMAPI, an API for accessing and modifying the DHCP
      server and client state.
    * Conditional behaviour 
    * Storing arbitrary information on leases 
    * Address pools with access control 
    * Client classing 
    * Address allocation restriction by class 
    * Relay agent information option support 
    * Dynamic DNS updates 
    * Many bug fixes, performance enhancements, and minor
      new DHCP protocol features.

Also, a fully-featured implementation of dynamic DNS updates is
included and there are no build dependencies with any BIND version.

Since patch-level 15, a log-facility configuration parameter has
been added, see the manual pages for details.
