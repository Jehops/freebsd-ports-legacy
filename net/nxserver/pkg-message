*******************************************************************************

This port provides only the NX core binaries and libraries as were released
by NoMachine as source code. To make them work and be used as an NX server,
you will need to:
* either install FreeNX (net/freenx) additionally,
* or install the commercial NoMachine server product (currently not available
  in native FreeBSD form)
