tcpdump(1) hacked to better understand SMB packets. 
smbtcpdump gives the ability to interpret NBT and SMB packets in a fair bit
of detail.

To capture all SMB packets going to or from host "fred" try this:

	tcpdump -i eth0 -s 1500 port 139 host fred

If you want name resolution or browse packets then try ports 137 and
138 respectively.

Example Output:

Here is a sample of a capture of a "SMBsearch" directory search. If
you don't get output that looks like this then smbtcpdump is not working
correctly.
