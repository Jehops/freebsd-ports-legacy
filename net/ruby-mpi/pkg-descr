MPI Ruby is a Ruby binding of MPI. The primary goal in making this binding was
to make the power of MPI available to Ruby users in a way that fits into the
language's object oriented model.  In order to do this, the buffer and datatype
management necessary in the C, C++, and Fortran bindings have been removed.
What this means is that MPI Ruby allows you to treat objects as messages.

MPI Ruby also aims to be a complete binding to MPI in that it offers access to
nearly all functionality of MPI. While there is not a one-to-one correspondence
to functions and constants in the Ruby and C/C++/Fortran bindings, all of the
communication and topology features are available. There are fewer methods in
the Ruby binding than there are functions in the C/C++/Fortran bindings, but
this is mainly due to the fact that the programmer no longer needs to deal with
buffers and datatypes.
