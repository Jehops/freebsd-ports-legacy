Freenet Grab (fngrab.py) is a GPL'd replacement for the official Freenet
Project's freenet_request (Un*x) and frequest.exe (Windows). Freenet Grab has
several features freenet_request/frequest doesn't have:

   - Retrying failed requests with incremental hops to live.
   - New: Multiple simultaneous downloads (multi-threading)
   - Better support for in-Freenet key index searching.
   - Specify a file containing a list of keys to download.
   - Verifying a list of keys in a file.
