This module is just a translation of the C socket.h file. Unlike the old
mechanism of requiring a translated socket.ph file, this uses the h2xs program
(see the Perl source distribution) and your native C compiler. This means
that it has a far more likely chance of getting the numbers right. This includes
all of the commonly used pound-defines like AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, etc.
