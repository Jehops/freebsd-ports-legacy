		scotty - network management extensions to tcl


scotty is a tcl extension which allows to set up TCP and UDP
connections, to send various ICMP packets, to query the domain name
system (DNS), to check clock screw using the NTP protocol and to query
various SUN RPC services (like rstat and mountd).

Included in this package is an interface to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. The
SNMP stack was written from scratch to provide an efficient and
portable tcl SNMP extension. MIB extensions can be written in tcl by
running the scotty extension as an SNMP agent. This allows you to
implement your own specific MIB without getting in contact with the
lowlevel ASN.1/BER stuff.

The scotty package includes scripts for the tkined network editor to
troubleshoot your IP network (ping, traceroute, finger, query tcp
services, query RPC services), for monitoring network status plus
scripts to discover and layout the topology of your IP network. SNMP
based scripts can be used to dump routing tables, to query interface
status and to monitor SNMP variables. There is also a MIB browser to
inspect the MIB hierarchy.
