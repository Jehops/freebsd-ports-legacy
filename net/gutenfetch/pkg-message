gutenfetch must be run once to pick out local Project Gutenberg
servers.  If you are an administrator please copy the generated
file ~/.gutenfetchrc to /etc/gutenfetchrc.  This will prevent other
users from having to pick out their favorite servers.

gutenfetch also performs best with a caching proxy server such as
wwwoffle or squid.
