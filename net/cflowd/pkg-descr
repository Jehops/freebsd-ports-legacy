cflowd is a flow analysis tool currently used for analyzing Cisco's
NetFlow enabled switching method.

The current release includes the collections, storage, and basic
analysis modules for cflowd and for arts++ libraries.

This analysis package permits data collection and analysis by ISPs
and network engineers in support of capacity planning, trends analysis,
and characterization of workloads in a network service provider environment.

Other areas where cflowd may prove useful include usage tracking for Web
hosting, accounting and billing, network planning and analysis, network
monitoring, developing user profiles, data warehousing and mining,
as well as security-related investigations.
