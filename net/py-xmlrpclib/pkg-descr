Fredrik Lundh's original and widely used Python implementation of Userland's
XML-RPC protocol (http://www.xmlrpc.com/) is tightly integrated with Python
and extremely simple to use.  It includes a simple example server based on
Python's SocketServer class, and an XML-RPC handler for Medusa.

Version 0.9.9 is regarded as a beta-quality development release.
