mldonkey is a OCAML/GTK client for both eDonkey and Overnet
peer-to-peer networks.
(see http://www.edonkey2000.com/ and the 'edonkey' ports)
(see http://www.overnet.com/)

This is the official GTK GUI that comes along with the port.
Like all other control methods (telnet, web), it can run on
another box than the client does.

Other features over the original eDonkey client are:
- better stability
- faster operation
- much better control
- saves its current state, checksums and known peers 
  (instead of starting from scratch every time)
