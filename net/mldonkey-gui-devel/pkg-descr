mldonkey is a OCAML/GTK client for the eDonkey peer-to-peer network
(see http://www.edonkey2000.com/ and the 'edonkey' ports).

It is separated into a core with telnet and web interfaces, and
brings a GTK GUI.

Other features over the original client are:
- better stability
- faster operation
- much better control
- saves its current state, checksums and known peers 
  (instead of starting from scratch every time)
