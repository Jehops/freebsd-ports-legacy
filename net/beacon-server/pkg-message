Beacon Server

You must configure your beaconserver by editing:
${PREFIX}/beaconserver/beaconserver_server.pl

You should run 
${PREFIX}/beaconserver/beaconserver_htmlgen.pl
periodically (e.g. via cron) to generate HTML report of the measurement data.

You should need a Web server to make the report available.
