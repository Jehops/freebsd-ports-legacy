DHIS Daemon release 4.0
==============================

dhisd is the DHIS daemon. The deamon is used to update DNS tables on a 
running unix based DNS server, running BIND 8.1.2 or higher. It's clients
should run the dhis-client 3 or 4 software to send updates.

You need a full DNS domain to run this server. You should at least have a 
domain hosted for you with a primary and backup dns server and 1 
backup mail-exchanger.

If you don't know what the previous lines where about, 
you probably shouldn't try and run this software.

For more information on the services of DHIS, you should look at the
