tdetect  A simple  C library for portable packet creation 

  If you're interested to detect all attempts to make "traceroute your-host"
or "traceroute host.your-network", you can try to use this simple program.  
The idea is simple - to detect UDP (Unix traceroute) or ICMP ECHO (Windows  
traceroute) packets with TTL fields == 1.
