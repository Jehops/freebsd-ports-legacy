Samba-TNG (i.e. The Next Generation) is a fork of the Samba codebase
whose goal is to provide the complete functionality of a Windows NT
domain controller.  Like Samba, Samba-TNG can also act as a file and
print server for LanManager clients such as MS-DOS, OS/2, MS-Windows,
Windows NT and Windows 2000, and as a WINS (Windows Internet Name
Service) server.
