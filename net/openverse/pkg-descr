From Web Page:
	OpenVerse is a visual chat program written in Tcl/Tk. The program
	connects to any OpenVerse server (server and client code included).

	The OpenVerse is similar to other graphical chat systems like The
	Palace and Microsoft Chat with the main difference being that it
	is much more OPEN and also runs on a variety of systems including
	Windows, *nix (Yes Linux too), Macintosh OS/2 you name it! Anything
	which Tcl/Tk is available for should run OpenVerse just fine!
