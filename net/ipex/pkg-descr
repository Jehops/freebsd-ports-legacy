Ipex is a packet sniffer similar to tcpdump or ngrep. It allows you
to dump the contents of a packet in hexadecimal or plain old text.
Using ipex, you have the ability to dump packets using the
following methods:

	1) regular expression (standard or extended)
	2) pid, uid or ruid
	3) binary signature
	4) pcap expression

The manual comes with allot of very descriptive examples on
using ipex and its recommended that you read it.
