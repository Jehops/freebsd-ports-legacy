The ipex program is similar to ngrep or tcpdump. It
allows you to dump packet contents in hexidecimal or
plaintext. A very handy tool for debugging network proto-
cols. ipex also gives you the option of running in daemon
mode while dumping contents to a specified file. It also
allows you to supply a regex RC pattern for printing pack-
ets wich contain specific patterns. This man page comes
with some fairly descriptive examples.
