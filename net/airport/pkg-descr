This is a configuration program for the Apple Airport and Lucent RG-1000
in Java.

The Airport and Lucent RG-1000 are the same, except for one detail:
On the RG-1000 the net name cannot be changed and is overridden by
the hex number on the label on the bottom.

This port also installs the Link Monitor and Host Monitor utilities.
It doesn't install the modem utility because there's no version numbered
distfile available.
