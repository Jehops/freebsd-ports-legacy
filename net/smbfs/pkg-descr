This is native SMB/CIFS filesystem (smbfs for short) for FreeBSD.
It is a complete, kernel side implementation of SMB requester and filesystem.

Please note, that this version of smbfs has been tested with recent
FreeBSD-current and FreeBSD 4.X.

I'm would be very grateful for any feedback, bug reports etc.

smbfs has been tested with the following SMB servers:

Samba, Windows 95/98/ME/2000/NT4.0(SPs 4, 5, 6), IBM LanManager, NetApp.
