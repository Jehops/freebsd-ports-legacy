xboxproxy is an xbox system link proxy that bridges xbox network traffic
across multiple separate networks. This allows an XBox to communicate via
system link across multiple networks (eg. two people in different states).
It also supports bridging of the Apple Rendezvous protocol for sharing of
iTunes music shares across different Layer 3 networks..
