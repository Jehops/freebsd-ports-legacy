Streaming Quicktime server for FreeBSD.

Elsa is a standards-based Quicktime server
based on the RTSP (RFC 2326) and RTP (RFC 1889)
standards.  This version is a beta which is
currently free for non-commercial use.

The server can serve media from QuickTime 4.0
"hinted" files which transparently support
multiple media formats (e.g. QuickTime, AVI,
MP3, WAV, AU, etc.).
