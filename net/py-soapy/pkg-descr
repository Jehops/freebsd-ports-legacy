From the website:

  SOAPy is a SOAP/XML Schema Library for Python.  Given either a WSDL or SDL
  document, SOAPy discovers the published API for a web service and exposes
  it to Python applications as transparently as possible.  SOAPy is designed
  to support WSDL 1.0 and SOAP 1.1, and whatever version of SDL is being used
  to power Microsoft's TerraService web service.  :)
