 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .B afpd
 provides an AppleTalk Filing Protocol (AFP)
 interface to the Unix file system.  It is normally started at boot time
 from
-.BR /etc/rc .
-The list of volumes offered to the user is generated from
-.B :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.system
-and one of
-.BR :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.default ,
-.BR $HOME/AppleVolumes ,
-or
-.BR $HOME/.AppleVolumes .
+.BR :ETCDIR:/rc.d/netatalk.sh .
+Configuration information is read from the configuration file 
+.BR :ETCDIR:/afpd.conf ,
+and the command line.
 .LP
-The
-.B AppleVolumes
-files is used to specify volumes to mount and file name extension mappings.
-It is formatted as follows, one specification per line:
-.RS
-.sp
-.I pathname
-[
-.I volumename
-]
-.br
-.RI . extension
-[
-.I type
-[
-.I creator
-]
-]
-.sp
-.RE
-If
-.I volumename
-is unspecified, the last component of
-.I pathname
-is used.  No two volumes may have the same name.  If
-.I type
-is unspecified
-.RB ' ???? '
-is used.  If
-.I creator
-is unspecified
-.RB ' UNIX '
-is used.  The extension
-.RB ' . '
-sets the default creator and type for otherwise untyped Unix files.
-Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.
+.B afpd
+supports some of AFP 2.2's features, in particular access via AFP-over-TCP,
+support for volumes larger than 2\ GB, a login greeting message, ProDOS
+support, and Two-Way Random Number Exchange for Authentication. Access via
+TCP can be protected via TCP Wrappers.
+.B afpd
+can be configured to provide multiple, seperately configured virtual
+servers.

+.SH VOLUME SPECIFICATION
+The
+.B AppleVolumes
+files are used to specify parts of the file system to be made available to
+clients (``volumes'') and file name extension mappings. Empty lines and
+lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored. Each line either contains a volume
+definition or an extention mapping, providing Mac\ OS type and creator
+information for files that do not yet have this information.
+.LP
+The list of volumes offered to the user is generated from
+.B :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.system
+and one of
+.BR :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.default ,
+.BR $HOME/AppleVolumes ,
+or
+.BR $HOME/.AppleVolumes ,
+subject to the configuration file and command line options.
+.LP
+Volume definitons are formatted as follows:
+.RS
+.sp
+.I pathname
+[\fIvolumename\fR]
+.sp
+.RE
+If \fIvolumename\fR is unspecified, the last component of
+\fIpathname\fR is used.  No two volumes may have the same name.  
+.LP
+An extension mapping is formatted as follows:
+.RS
+.sp 
+.I .extension
+[\fItype\fR [\fIcreator\fR] ]
+.sp
+.RE
+If \fItype\fR is unspecified, ``\fB????\fR'' is used.  If \fIcreator\fR is
+unspecified, ``\fBUNIX\fR'' is used.  The extension ``\fB.\fR''
+sets the default creator and type for otherwise untyped Unix files.
+
 .SH AUTHENTICATION
 .B afpd
-currently understands three User Authentication Methods (UAMs):
-.BR NoUserAuthent ,
-or guest,
-.B Cleartxt
-.BR passwrd ,
-and
-.B Kerberos
-.BR IV .
-If a user uses
-.BR NoUserAuthent ,
-s/he will only be offered default volumes to mount, and will only be able
-to read and write files that are permitted to the guest user.  The
-.B -G
-option disables
-.BR NoUserAuthent .
-With
-.B Cleartxt passwd
-and
-.B Kerberos
-.BR IV ,
+provides a number of User Authentication Methods (UAMs). The
+\fBNoUserAuthent\fR (or guest) and the \fBCleartxt\fR methods are always
+available (subject to the configuration file and command line options).
+.LP
+The \fBRandNum\fR and \fBTwoWayRandNum\fR methods are available to a
+particular user if she or he has a file ``\fB.passwd\fR'' in the home
+directory, and that file is readable only by the user herself. When
+authenticating using one of these methods, the user also can change her or
+his password (subject to the configuration file and command line options).
+.LP
+The \fBKerberos IV\fR method depends on both the server and the client
+having installed appropriate Kerberos IV software.
+.LP
+The \fBAFP Kerberos\fR method is deprecated.
+
+.SH FILE STORAGE
 .B afpd
-offers the user all volumes listed in
-.BR $HOME/AppleVolumes .
-The user may also read and write all files that s/he normally could.
-.B Cleartxt passwd
-is not recommended for AFS use.
-.B Kerberos IV
-is recommended for AFS use.
-A forth, depricated UAM is also included in the distribution,
-.B AFS
-.BR Kerberos .
+stores files in the \fBAppleDouble\fR file format, which stores the data for
+a Mac\ OS file in a regular file, and the Finder information and resource
+fork in a file with the same name in a subdirectory named
+``\fB.AppleDouble\fR.''
+.LP
+For files that do not yet have Mac OS Finder information, \fBafpd\fR
+automatically creates this information based on the extension mapping table,
+and subject to access permissions on the respective directory. No
+translation is done for files stored from a client.
+.LP
+Files created from a client whose name contains ASCII control characters or
+characters with the eighth bit set are converted, where each such character
+is replaced by the sequence ``:XX'', with ``XX'' being the hexadecimal code
+for the character. File names starting with a ``.'' or longer than 31
+characters are ignored.
