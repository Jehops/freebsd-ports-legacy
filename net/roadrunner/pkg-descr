RoadRunner is a complete application toolkit library implementing the BEEP
(Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) for use in developing network
applications.

Features:
* Portability -  Runs unmodified on most major platforms.
* Object oriented design - RoadRunner is designed in an object oriented
fashion, making development of new BEEP profiles simple and straight-forward.
* Robustness and stability - The software contains extensive validation checks
and error reporting, allowing for quickly locating and fixing bugs. As a
result, RoadRunner is already at its first release a very stable library.
* High performance - Nonblocking design, constant message processing time and
intra-connection channel scheduling capability makes RoadRunner a suitable
framework for demanding network applications.
* Multithreaded - Using the threads abstraction layer in glib, RoadRunner runs
natively multithreaded on all supported platforms.
* Open Source - Permits royalty-free use, development and modification as part
of open source software.
