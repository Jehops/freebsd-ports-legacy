.Nm tcpmssd
.Nd TCP Maximum Segment Size option corrector
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Fl p Ar port
.Eo \&{
.Fl i Ar iface | Fl m Ar mtu
.Ec \&}
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that adjusts outgoing TCP SYN packets so that the maximum
receive segment size is not greater than the amount allowed by the
interface MTU.
.Pp
This is necessary in many setups to avoid problems caused by routers that
drop ICMP
.Dq Datagram Too Big
messages, thus breaking Path MTU discovery algorithm (RFC 1191).
Without these messages, the originating machine sends data, it passes
the rogue router then hits a machine that has an MTU that is not big
enough for the data.
Because the IP
.Dq don't fragment
option is set, this machine sends an ICMP
.Dq Datagram Too Big
message back to the originator and drops the packet.
The rogue router drops the ICMP and the originator never gets to
discover that it must reduce the Path MTU value or exclude the IP
.Dq don't fragment
option from its outgoing data.
.Pp
.Nm
normally runs in the background as a daemon.
It intercepts TCP packets
from a
.Xr divert 4
socket bound to the
.Ar port
specified with the
.Fl p
option and reduces the value of TCP MSS option if necessary so that
the incoming TCP messages will pass through this host without need to
send ICMP
.Dq Datagram Too Big
messages.
.Pp
The maximum value for the TCP MSS option is determined based on a MTU
given either as an absolute value with the
.Fl m
option or derived from a network interface specified with the
.Fl i
option.
.Pp
If run with the
.Fl v
option,
.Nm
does not detach from its controlling terminal and writes various diagnostic
messages to the standard error output.
.Pp
The following steps are necessary to run
.Nm No :
.Bl -enum
.It
Build your kernel with the following options:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
options IPFIREWALL
options IPDIVERT

kernel.

Make sure to redirect TCP traffic to the
.Xr divert 4
port
.Ar port .
