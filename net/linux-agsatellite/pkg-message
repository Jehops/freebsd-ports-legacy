* Accounts are now created FIRST on the website. To create a new
account and use the software go to http://www.audiogalaxy.com/betatest
and signup (login). Then use the SAME login information you used
on the web when the Satellite asks you for it.

* Feel free to edit the file called shares.txt. Each line in the
text file should specify a directory where your files are. The
first directory is where the files you request are downloaded to.
FreeBSD users must create account.txt and shares.txt in their
favorite text editor before the Satellite will run. The format of
account.txt is simply email that you used to create an account from
the web site on the first line. The second line will be your password

> account.txt
first_line_with_Username_you_have_subscribed
second_line_with_Password_you_have_subscribed

For example,

echo Username_you_have_subscribed > account.txt
echo Password_you_have_subscribed >> account.txt

* Create both account.txt and shares.txt files under the directory
.agsatellite in your HOME directory
