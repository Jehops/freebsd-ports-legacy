This is a port of IPVS (aka LVS) on FreeBSD. IPVS is a highly scalable 
and highly available server built on a cluster of real servers, with the 
load balancer. The architecture of the server cluster is fully 
transparent to end users, and the users interact as if it were a single
high-performance virtual server.
