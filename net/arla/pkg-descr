Arla is a free AFS client implementation.

The main goal of the Arla project is to make a fully functional client with all
capabilities of commercial AFS. Other planned and implemented things are
all the normal management tools and a server.

Version 0.9 status:

* Read/write support
* Authentication (with kth-krb4)
* Working filesystem on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux and Solaris
* Some administration programs (fs, vos and pts)
