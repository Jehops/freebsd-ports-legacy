If you are planning to use the Satellite server (not the client) on
this machine you must complete several additional steps, substituting
your installation prefix (usually /usr/local) for PREFIX:

1) Create the Satellite configuration file:
# PREFIX/sbin/satcfg -L
# chown satellite PREFIX/etc/satellite.db
# chmod 600 PREFIX/etc/satellite.db

2) Create the Satellite log file:
# touch /var/log/satellite
# chown satellite /var/log/satellite

3) Add Satellite to /etc/services with the line:
satellite	1764/tcp

4) Add Satellite to /etc/inetd.conf with the line:
satellite stream tcp nowait satellite PREFIX/sbin/satellited satellited -v
