 Tn3270 permits a full-screen, full-duplex connection from a UNIX machine
 to an IBM (or compatible) machine.  Tn3270 gives the appearance of being
 logged in to the remote machine from an IBM 3270 terminal.  Of course,
 you must have an account on the machine to which you connect in order to
 log in.  Tn3270 looks to the user in many respects like the Yale ASCII
 Terminal Communication System II.  Tn3270 is actually a modification of
 the Arpanet TELNET user interface (see telnet(1))  which will, in certain
 circumstances, interpret and generate raw 3270 control streams.
