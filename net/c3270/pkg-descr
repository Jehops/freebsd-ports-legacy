 From html/Intro.html:

   c3270 is a curses-based IBM 3270 terminal emulator.  It can be used to
   communicate with any IBM host that supports 3270-style connections
   over TELNET.  It can also communicate with hosts that use line-by-line
   ASCII mode to do initial login negotiation before switching to
   full-screen 3270 mode.

 From "pr3287/README":
