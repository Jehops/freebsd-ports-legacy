==================================================================

This port installs the dict daemon but does not envoke dictd
by default.

To invoke dictd on startup, put the following in /etc/rc.conf:

    dictd_enable="YES"

The dict client can be found within ports/textproc/dict.

Don't forget to install ports/net/dictd-database to run
a dictd server without pain.
