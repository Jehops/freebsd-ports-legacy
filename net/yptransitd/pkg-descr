An alternative to nss_ldap using an ldap based NIS/YP server.

This is a UNIX daemon providing NIS services with a modular 
backend interface. The current focus is the development of 
an LDAP module for the backend data source.

This daemon was (and is being written) in order to migrate a 
large install base of UNIX systems utilizing NIS to an LDAP 
based solution, eventually facilititing a migration of all 
corporate services that rely on similar data to LDAP.

This (and future) LDAP related tools are being released under 
the BSD License (with advertising clause).

Please understand that the project is, at best, a beta.

There is no documentation yet.
