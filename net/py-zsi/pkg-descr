Paraphrasing the original (1.0 and 1.1) website:

  ZSI, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a pure Python module that provides
  an implementation of the SOAP 1.1 specification.  ZSI parses and generates
  SOAP messages, and converts between native Python datatypes and SOAP
  syntax.  Simple client and server support are also provided.

  ZSI is built on top of DOM.  It requires Python 2.0 or later, and PyXML 0.6
  or later.  Feedback to <zsi@zolera.com>.
