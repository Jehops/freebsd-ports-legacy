       The Archie module finds files available via anonymous ftp
       by making requests to an Archie server.  The package
       communicates with the Archie server via the Prospero
       protocol, which is layered on the Asynchronous Reliable
       Delivery Protocol, which is layered on UDP.

       The usual entry point is Archie::archie_request, which
       takes arguments similar to the Unix archie command-line
       client, and returns an array of hash references which
       point to the returned data.

       The routine Archie::archie_cancel cancels the request on
       the server; this stops the server from sending packets to
       a canceled client process.

       This release is $Revision: 1.5 $.
