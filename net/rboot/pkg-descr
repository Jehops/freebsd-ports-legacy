RBoot is a remote boot facility for PC operating systems.
More specifically, it allows you to set up several PCs so that they fetch
their operating system from a central UNIX server on boot time.

By having all the clients use the same boot image, and by storing
differences in the clients' configuration in separate files, RBoot allows
the sysadmin to reduce his/her administration efforts from factor N to 
factor 1.

RBoot requires a UNIX server that is capable of exporting a directory via
NFS, and that has a bootpd server (for BOOTP). Any recent UNIX should meet
these criteria. At the moment, RBoot supports only booting the
Windows 95/98 operating systems, but support for Windows NT 4, Win 3.11
and DOS/LanManager eventually be added.

RBoot is freely redistributable under a BSD-style license.

Please note that RBoot is no longer supported by its author, and is not
under active development.
