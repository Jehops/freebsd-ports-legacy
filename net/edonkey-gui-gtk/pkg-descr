[ excerpt from Developer's site]

This is a user interface to tell eDonkey2000 'core' what to do (ie.
connect to servers, do searches, download stuff). The core comes
with a very simple text interface (=command line client), where you
can tell it what to do by typing in commands. Most people do not
find this very convenient and rather have a window with lists and
buttons to click. The 'GUI' is a separate program which connect to
the core via a TCP connection and tells it what to do. Likewise,
the core sends messages to the GUI when something happens (eg. a
download has finished), so the GUI can present this to the user.
