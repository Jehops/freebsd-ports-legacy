This is the Cistron RADIUS daemon. Radiusd is a daemon that handles
remote authentication requests and accounting for RADIUS clients. The
clients may be terminal servers, Network Access Servers or other
RADIUS servers.

NOTE: This version of radiusd-cistron is in BETA, although it appears
to work reliably.
