			** IMPORTANT **

    To activate this port, create a new profile in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
    called ``adsl'' using /usr/local/share/speedtouch/ppp.conf.sample
    as a template, then copy /usr/local/etc/rc.d/asdl.sh.sample to
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/asdl.sh.

    You may need to change the value of MODE in adsl.sh.
