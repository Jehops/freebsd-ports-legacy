4g8 (Forge Gateway) is a tool that allows you to capture
traffic from a third party in a switched environment at the
expense of a slight increase in latency to that third party
host. Utilizing ARP cache poisoning, packet capture, and packet
reconstruction techniques, it works with nearly all TCP, ICMP,
and UDP IPv4 traffic flows.
