This is a port of MCLv3, an open source implementation of the ALC and 
NORM Reliable Multicast Protocols.

The MCLv3 project is an Open-Source GNU/GPL, multi-platform 
implementation of the two major reliable multicast protocols being 
standardized by the RMT IETF working group: ALC/LCT and NORM. It is 
composed of a C/C++ library and several applications built on top of it 
and provides an easy-to-use and integrated solution for reliable and 
highly scalable multicast delivery of data.
