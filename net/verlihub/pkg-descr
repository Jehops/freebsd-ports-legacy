Verlihub is a Linux/Unix Direct Connect protocol server (Hub).
It is written in c++, has relatively low CPU and RAM usage,
and has many useful features. It also uses a MySQL Database.

These are plugins that can be used to provide additional
functionality not present in the Verlihub base. They work
similarly to 'bots' which have been developed for other hub
servers, without the need for uncompiled scripts.
