RADIUS is a protocol which allows network hardware such as remote-access
concentrators and routers to authenticate and log accounting records
for logins.  The FreeRADIUS project is developing an Open Source
alternative to the semi-proprietary Lucent and MERIT servers; it is an
indirect followon to the Cistron RADIUS server.  This server is
presently considered ``alpha-quality'' code by its developers.
