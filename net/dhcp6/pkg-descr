kame-dhcp6 is an open-source implementation of Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) developed by the KAME
project.

The implementation mainly conforms to the following standards:

- RFC3315: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
- RFC3319: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options 
 	   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers
- RFC3633: IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
           Protocol (DHCP)
- RFC3646: DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host
           Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)

Note that the current implementation does not support IPv6 address
allocation by DHCPv6, and there is no plan to implement that feature
at the moment.  The main purpose of this implementation is to provide
a way of IPv6 prefix delegation (RFC3633) and to provide some
"stateless" configuration information such as DNS recursive server
addresses.
