Pure Load Balancer is a high-performance software load balancer for the
HTTP protocol.

It uses an asynchronous non-forking/non-blocking model, and provides
fail-over abilities. When a backend server goes down, it automatically
removes it from the server pool, and tries to bring it back to life later.
