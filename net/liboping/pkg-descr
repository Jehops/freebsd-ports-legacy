liboping is a C library to generate ICMP echo requests, better known as
"ping packets". It is intended for use in network monitoring applications
or applications that would otherwise need to fork ping(1) frequently.
Included is a sample application, called oping, which demostrates the
library's abilities. It is like ping, ping6, and fping rolled into one.
