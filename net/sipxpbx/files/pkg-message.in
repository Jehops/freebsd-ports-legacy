Before you can run sipX, you must perform a number of manual
configuration step.  This includes adding DNS entries, setting up
SSL certificates and modifying your httpd.conf file.  The SSL
certificate is *not* optional, even for quick tests, the various
sipX modules use the SSL certificate when they communcation with
each other).

In general, the following URL is a good place to get information
on installing and running sipX.  We've already taken care of the
compiling and installing bits, but you still need to do some final
configuration:

sipX can take advantage of DNS SRV for your SIP traffic.  This
affords and extra level of flexibility if you choose to use it.
Please read:
	http://sipx-wiki.calivia.com/index.php/DNS_Configuration

sipX provide a couple scripts to simplify the SSL certificate
generation and installation procedure.  Please read:

	%%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.ssl

You will also need to adjust your %%APACHEETCDIR%%/httpd.conf file.
	Ensure httpd runs as user sipx and group sipx.  Ala:
		User sipx
		Group sipx
	Change the document root to
		DocumentRoot %%PREFIX%%/www/sipX/doc
	The <Directory > instance should match
		<Directory "%%PREFIX%%/www/sipX/doc">
	Finally, include these lines:

	<IfModule ssl_module>
		Include %%PREFIX%%/etc/sipxpbx/httpd-sipxchange-common-ssl.conf
	</IfModule>

	Include %%PREFIX%%/etc/sipxpbx/httpd-sipxchange-common.conf
	Include %%PREFIX%%/etc/sipxpbx/httpd-sipxchange-configserver.conf


Edit the sipX configuration file.  Be sure to match the configuration
entries against your DNS configuration.

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/sipxpbx/config.defs

Modify /etc/crontab to run the following daily
	%%PREFIX%%/bin/sipx-chkspace
	%%PREFIX%%/bin/voicemail_clean

You also need to configure unixODBC to map to the postgresql database.
Add the following lines to %%PREFIX%%/etc/odbcinst.ini
	[PostgreSQL]
	Description = PostgreSQL driver
	Driver = %%PREFIX%%/lib/libodbcpsql.so
	Setup = %%PREFIX%%/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
	FileUsage = 1
	Threading = 2

Don't forget to initialize the postgresql database if you haven't already.
See the postgresql port for details.

I've found it necessary to increase the size of Sys V shared memory,
semaphores, etc.  Add the following lines to %%DESTDIR%%/boot/loader.conf
	kern.ipc.shmmax=134217728
	kern.ipc.shmall=65536
	kern.ipc.semmni=40
	kern.ipc.semmns=240
	kern.ipc.semume=40
	kern.ipc.semmnu=120

The newly created user, sipx, will use the directory containing UA (phone)
boot files as its home directory.  Thus you can configure your phones to
FTP their boot files as user sipx.

As of this writing, there is a bug in mod_cplusplus.  This bug causes
httpd to core dump when httpd exits.  httpd behaves fine while running,
so it is usable.  At this point, the core dump is more an annoyance
than anything else.
