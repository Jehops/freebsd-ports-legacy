sipXpbx is a full-featured SIP pbx proxy.  Configuration is done
via a web interface that also configures User Agents (aka SIP
phones).

We think sipX is the leading open source IP PBX in terms of
scalability, robustness and ease of use. The sipX IP PBX has been
successfully deployed in a lot of places. The largest known
installation serves more than 5,000 users connected to one redundant
(HA) system. Small installations go all the way down to a few users
served by very low cost hardware.

There is a detailed list of features on the sipX Wiki (it is too
long to re-produce here). Here is why you should consider using
sipX:

1) sipXconfigYou need an IP PBX that is robust, stable and easy to use

2) Need a system that offers plug & play management of all the
   components including phones

3) It is a mission critical system and therefore you insist in
   high-availability redundat configuration.  A server failure should
   not interrupt calls

4) Voice quality is important to you and therefore you want a system
   that routes media peer-to-peer and not through the PBX

5) SIP standards compliance that allows flexible call routing including
   SIP trunking

6) Need scalability - sipX is known to work for deployments
   in excess of 5,000 users connected to one redundant server

7) Lots of features - of course, who does not want that

8) Unlimited number of simultaneous calls, and unlimited number of
   trunks using distributed gateways

9) Need IT integration with no special needs for specific HW.

10) Runs on off-the-shelf Intel servers
