Sun IPv6socket_scrub program
============================

The ipv6socket_scrub utility searches  recursively  through
the  current directory  (the  default) or any specified
directory or file to find IPv4 socket code that may be a 
candidate for modification when porting to the IPv6 socket API. 
The utility is designed to run from a Solaris machine.
