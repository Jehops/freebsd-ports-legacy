AIM-Transport 0.9
-----------------

This version of the AIM Transport is designed specifically to work with the
Jabber server version 1.4.  It will not work with previous versions due to the
way that it loads itself into the main jabberd binary.

To build the AIM Transport uncompress the tarball, if you uncompressed it into
the Jabber 1.4 directory you can run the configure directly and it will find
jabberd.  Otherwise, you need to use the --with-jabberd=PATH option to
configure.  At this point you can run make and it should build just fine.  Note 
this version of the AIM Transport no longer requires a seperate download of
libfaim.
