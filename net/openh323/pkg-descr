OpenH323 is a multi-platform H323 Video Conferencing library.

This can be used to make H323 Video Conferencing applications
and the port produces a sample application called simph323.

However, a fully featured H323 client, including Video
as well as Audio can be found in the OhPhone Port.

Simph323 and OhPhone can exchange full duplex audio with other H323
compliant video conferencing programs including Microsoft NetMeeting.
OhPhone adds full Video support.

The OpenH323 library makes use of PWLib. http://www.equival.com
PWLib is a multi-platform code library that can be used to write
applications that will compile and run on the BSD Unixes, Windows, Linux
and a few other Unix variants. It was developed by Equivalence Ltd Pty.

By default, the OpenH323 library contains code to display video images
using X Windows. This is not needed in certain applications such
as gatekeepers, gateways or the OpenAM application.
You can compile the port with
  make -DNO_XWINDOWS
to build the port without X Windows support.
