****  To setup dhcrelay, you have to rename %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-\
      dhcrelay.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcrelay.sh to
      enable automatic startup.
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcrelay.conf may need to be edited to setup
      the `dhcrelay_servers' as required.  If needed, you may also tune
      `dhcrelay_options' and `dhcrelay_ifaces', both defaulted to `nothing'.
      See dhcrelay(8) for details about possible options.
