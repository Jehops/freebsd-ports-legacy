****  This port installs dhcp relay daemon, but don't invokes dhcrelay by
      default. If you want to invoke dhcrelay at startup, put these lines
      into /etc/rc.conf.

	    dhcrelay_enable="YES"
	    dhcrelay_flags=""		# command option(s)
	    dhcrelay_servers=""		# dhcrelay server(s)
	    dhcrelay_ifaces=""		# ethernet interface(s)

****  For instance, rc.conf like variables are still read from
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcrelay.conf. They should be move
      into /etc/rc.conf. Also, the dhcrelay_options variable
      must be renamed dhcrelay_flags.
