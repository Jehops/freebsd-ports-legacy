IF you need mod_erlang_event. For right now you have to 

manualy install erlang-lite  in /usr/ports/lang/erlang-lite.

then come back to freeswitch and make the port and choose 

mod_erlang_event in the menu options.

Once the erlang port is fixed to build with other ports this

will be done automaticly.
