bmon is an interface bandwidth monitor using the curses library.
It's able to compute and draw three types of diagrams (overview,
graphical, and detailed). The overview diagram is a list of all
interfaces including the rx/tx rates of each interface. The
graphical diagram is a bar graph in ASCII. All diagrams are
continously updated.
