Unfortunately, this software has shameful history of several vulnerabilities
previously discovered.  FreeBSD Project cannot guarantee that this spree had
come to an end.  It is further complicated, as chronyd(8) requires superuser
permissions to operate; please type ``make deinstall'' to deinstall the port
if tight security is a concern.
