ntop has been installed, but is not quite ready to be used yet!

You need to set an administrator password for ntop before it may be used.
As root, execute the following command to set this password:

  # ntop -A

ntop may now be started.  The recommended method to do so is via the
installed startup script.  As root, execute the following command:

  # sh %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/ntop.sh

The recommended way to change startup flags for ntop is to edit this
startup script.

Note that the installed startup script will NOT be execute at system
startup by default.  If you wish ntop to start when your system boots,
you should make this script executable:

  # chmod 555 %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc/ntop.sh

			       NB!! NB!! NB!!
In the past, ntop has been the subject of repeated security vulner-
abilities, particularly relating to its web interface.  It is strongly
suggested that you protect your ntop web interface via packet filters
or TCP wrappers.
