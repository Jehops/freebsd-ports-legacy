****  To setup dhclient, you may need to edit /etc/rc.conf to replace the
      base system dhclient, such as :
            dhcp_program="%%PREFIX%%/sbin/dhclient"
            dhcp_flags="-q"
      See dhclient(8), using the following command, for details about other
      possible options:
            MANPATH=%%MAN1PREFIX%%/man man 8 dhclient
      
****  To setup dhcpd, you may have to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.  You also have to rename
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-\
      dhcpd.sh to enable automatic startup.
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf may be edited to tune some startup
      variables such as `dhcpd_options' or `dhcpd_ifaces', both defaulted
      to `nothing'. See dhcpd(8) for details about possible options.
      
****  To setup dhcrelay, you have to rename %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-\
      dhcrelay.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcrelay.sh to
      enable automatic startup.
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcrelay.conf may need to be edited to setup
      the `dhcrelay_servers' as required.  If needed, you may also tune
      `dhcrelay_options' and `dhcrelay_ifaces', both defaulted to `nothing'.
      See dhcrelay(8) for details about possible options.
