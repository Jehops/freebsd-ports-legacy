****  To setup dhcpd, please edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.

****  This port installs dhcp daemon, but doesn't invoke dhcpd by default. If
      you want to invoke dhcpd at startup, put these lines into /etc/rc.conf.

	    dhcpd_enable="YES"				# dhcpd enabled?
	    dhcpd_flags="-q"				# command option(s)
	    dhcpd_conf="%%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf"	# configuration file
	    dhcpd_ifaces=""				# ethernet interface(s)
	    dhcpd_withumask="022"			# file creation mask

****  If compiled with paranoia support (the default), the following lines
      are also supported:

	    dhcpd_chuser_enable="YES"		# runs w/o privileges?
	    dhcpd_withuser="dhcpd"		# user name to run as
	    dhcpd_withgroup="dhcpd"		# group name to run as
	    dhcpd_chroot_enable="YES"		# runs chrooted?
	    dhcpd_devfs_enable="YES"		# use devfs if available?
	    dhcpd_rootdir="/var/db/dhcpd"	# directory to run in
	    dhcpd_includedir="<some_dir>"	# directory with config-
						  files to include

****  WARNING: never edit the chrooted or jailed dhcpd.conf file but
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf instead which is always copied where
      needed upon startup.

****  WARNING: %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf is obsolete. rc.conf like
      variables are no longer read from there. Also, the dhcpd_options
      variable is obsolete. Use dhcpd_flags instead.
