Freenet6's TSP is a new initiative launched by Viagenie, a private
company in Canada involved in IPv6 since 1996, to facilitate a
faster deployment of an Internet IPv6. Internet is world-wide
deployed over IPv4, therefore this project has the main goal of
deploying IPv6 at a larger scale by using configured tunnels.

Configured tunnel is a transitional method standardized by the IETF
to use IPv6 in coexistence with IPv4 by encapsulating IPv6 packets
over IPv4. Any host already connected to Internet with IPv4 and
having an IPv6 stack could establish link to Internet IPv6.

Freenet6, developed by Viagenie in 1999-2000, was the first public
tunnel server service and one of the most used in the world to
delegate automatically one single IPv6 address to any host already
connected to an IPv4 network over configured tunnel simply by
filling a Web form and running a script. Freenet6's TSP is representing
another very important step to accelerate the deployment at large
scale of IPv6 to everyone on the net.
