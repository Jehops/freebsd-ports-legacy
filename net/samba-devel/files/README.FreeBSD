If you want to use samba ports,

1. Copy /usr/local/etc/smb.conf.default to /usr/local/etc/smb.conf, and edit
   it.
2. Put string 'samba_enable="YES"' into your /etc/rc.conf.
3. Type '/usr/local/etc/rc.d/samba.sh start' or reboot.

See document files in /usr/local/share/doc/samba and example config files in
/usr/local/share/examples/samba for details.

FreeBSD Samba ports for localization and encrypt passwords support are no
longer provided because these supports have been integrated into the
original distribution since 1.9.18.  If you're Western European or Japanese
Windows users, please set "client code page" parameter in smb.conf (1.9.18
does not support Chinese Windows. If you want to use Chinese samba, please
use chinese/samba port).  See smb.conf.sample for details.  If you want to
use NT4+SP3 or Win95+updates clients, set "encrypt passwords" parameter to
yes and use smbpasswd [username] to use /usr/local/private/smbpasswd for
authentication.
