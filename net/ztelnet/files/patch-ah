+Subject: Asking about ztelnet.tar.gz
+Status: RO
+
+
+Hello!
+I was informed your ztelnet.tar.gz in kaist BBS.
+I received that by the use of anonymous FTP.
+But... I couldn't take a download to my PC.
+I think that is unix compression file. I don't know about it.
+I tried to get it after renaming as ztelnet.tar.
+And succeeded..
+I got it. 
+But, I can't extract the renamed file. (ztelnet.tar) in my PC (DOS).
+
+Could you tell me how to extract that? 
+Was there my fault in this process?
+Please informe me in detail...
+
+Very truly yours.
+Thank you!
+
+Byung Kyu Park.  (Sorry about poor English)
