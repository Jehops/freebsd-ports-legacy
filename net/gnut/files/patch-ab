-    Many people have been submitting patches and suggestions for
-    modifying the auto-generated files, something which cannot be
-    done in the distribution versions.
-
-    Therefore, the file HACKING, located in the same directory as
-    this 'configure' script, has been provided to explain how to
-    change files and rebuild.  Please read that file before
-    submitting patches to the makefiles or scripts.
