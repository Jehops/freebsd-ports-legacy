Dnsmasq is a caching DNS forwarder designed to provide DNS service on a 
small network. It is targeted at home networks using NAT and connected to 
the internet via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection but would be a 
good choice for any small network where low resource use and ease of 
configuration are important.
