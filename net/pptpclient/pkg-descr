NOTE: The maintainer of this port strongly recommends the use of
the "mpd-netgraph" port instead of this port.  The mpd-netgraph
port is more flexible, and it works much better in every respect.
If you choose to use this port, the maintainer will be able to
offer you nothing beyond his sympathy.

This is a port of the "pptp-linux" PPTP client.  It can establish a
PPP connection with an NT server, tunneled through a PPTP link over
the Internet.  In effect, it makes the client machine behave as if
it were on the same LAN as the server.

I have fixed one serious bug in the program, and have patched it to
use FreeBSD's userland "ppp" package rather than "pppd" which it
was originally designed to use.  I found that "ppp" supplied more
versatility and was easier to set up.

There is no manpage for this package, but you will find some
quickstart instructions and example configuration files in
"${PREFIX}/share/examples/pptpclient".
