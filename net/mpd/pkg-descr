MPD MULTI-LINK PPP DAEMON FOR FREEBSD

Release 1.0b5
Written by Archie Cobbs <archie@whistle.com>
Based on IIJ-PPP by Toshiharu OHNO <tony-o@iij.ad.jp>

Please see the CHANGES file if you are updating from mpd-1.0b3.

* WHAT IS IT?

  A user-mode PPP daemon based on iij-ppp which supports multi-link PPP.
  It is a complete re-write of the original iij-ppp code.

* HOW STABLE IS IT?

  Most of this code has been thoroughly tested. Some parts, such
  as compression, have not been tested very much at all. However,
  the core of the daemon is very solid.

* HOW DO I BUILD AND INSTALL IT?

  cd src
  make depend all install

* HOW DO I SET IT UP?

  You will need to create your own versions of the four required
  configuration files in /etc/ppp:

    mpd.conf    - General configuration
    mpd.links   - Description of available links
    mpd.script  - Modem scripts
    mpd.secret  - Login/password pairs

  If you're familiar with iij-ppp, the configuration method is
  similar: commands are read from a file.

  Check the "conf" subdirectory for configuration file examples.

  Then append the following lines to /etc/syslog.conf and create an
  empty /var/log/mpd.log file to get proper logging:

    !mpd
    *.*                        /var/log/mpd.log

  Add a corresponding line to /etc/newsyslog.conf as well to get
  proper log rotation.

  If you want to start it as a background daemon at boot time,
  add the appropriate line to /etc/rc.local, e.g.:

    echo -n " mpd" ; /usr/local/bin/mpd -b

* WHAT'S THE COPYRIGHT STATUS?

  Berkeley style: see ``COPYRIGHT.iij'' and ``COPYRIGHT.whistle''.

* WHERE CAN I READ MORE ABOUT IT?

  In the "docs" directory is a preliminary man page and some other
  assorted stuff. In the "conf" directory are example configuration
  files with descriptive comments.

* WHERE CAN I GO FOR HELP?

  Email me any questions <archie@whistle.com> and I'll do my best
  to answer them.
