MPD MULTI-LINK PPP DAEMON FOR FREEBSD

Release 1.0b4
Written by Archie Cobbs <archie@whistle.com>
Based on IIJ-PPP by Toshiharu OHNO <tony-o@iij.ad.jp>

Please see the CHANGES file if you are updating from mpd-1.0b3.


* WHAT IS IT?

  A user-mode PPP daemon based on iij-ppp which supports multi-link PPP.
  It is a complete re-write of the original iij-ppp code.

* HOW STABLE IS IT?

  Most of this code has been thoroughly tested. Some parts, such
  as compression, have not been tested very much at all. However,
  the core of the daemon is very solid.

* HOW DO I SET IT UP?

  Check the "etc/mpd" directory for configuration file examples.
  There are four configuration files:

	mpd.conf.sample		- General configuration
	mpd.links.sample	- Description of available links
	mpd.script.sample	- Modem scripts
	mpd.secret.sample	- Login/password pairs

  If you're familiar with iij-ppp, the configuration method is
  similar: commands are read from a file.

* WHAT'S THE COPYRIGHT STATUS?

  Berkeley style: see ``COPYRIGHT.iij'' and ``COPYRIGHT.whistle''.

* WHERE CAN I READ MORE ABOUT IT?

  In the "doc/mpd" directory is a preliminary man page and some other
  assorted stuff. In the "etc/mpd" directory are example configuration
  files with descriptive comments.

* WHERE CAN I GO FOR HELP?

  Email me any questions <archie@whistle.com> and I'll do my best
  to answer them.
