************************************************************

The OpenLDAP server package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the LDAP server, you need to edit
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/openldap/slapd.conf
to suit your needs and add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:
  slapd_enable="YES"
  slapd_flags='-h "ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fopenldap%2fldapi/ ldap://0.0.0.0/"'
  slapd_sockets="/var/run/openldap/ldapi"

Then start the server with
  %%RC_DIR%%/slapd%%RC_SUFX%% start
or reboot.

Try `man slapd' and the online manual at
  http://www.OpenLDAP.org/doc/admin22/
for more information.
  
NOTE: Some variable names have been changed to conform with rc.subr(8)

If you are upgrading, you may want to check your configuration with
  grep ^slapd_ /etc/rc.conf

slapd runs under a non-privileged user id (by default `ldap'),
see %%RC_DIR%%/slapd%%RC_SUFX%% for more information.
