entitymib is a utility for displaying the physical configuration of an
SNMPv2c or v3 agent using the SNMP Entity MIB, and, for certain Cisco
Systems switches, displaying additional sensor and configuration
information from proprietary MIBs (which must be obtained separately).

entitymib is written entirely in Perl, but it uses the NetSNMP library
through its Perl binding, SNMP(3), and requires that NetSNMP's MIB
directories be correctly configured to provide, at a minimum, the
Entity MIB.
