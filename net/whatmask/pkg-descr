Notations supported:

	Name                  Example
	---------------------------------
	CIDR                         /24
	Netmask            255.255.255.0
	Wilcard Bits           0.0.0.255

The above notations are all identical. CIDR notation commonly has a "/" in
front of the number (representing the number of bits). Whatmask can accept
these notations with or without a slash. This notation is used more and more
recently. A lot of popular routers and software supprt this notation. 

Netmask notation is pretty much the standard old-school way of doing it. It is
supported by most systems (Un*x, Win, Mac, etc.). 

Wilcard bits are similar to the netmask, but they are the logical not of the
netmask. This notation is used by a number of popular routers.
