%%PKGNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%

Please edit config.php to suit your needs.

To make phpLDAPadmin available through your web site, 
I suggest that you add the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /phpldapadmin/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/htdocs"

Please note: if you are upgrading from version 0.9.7 or earlier, the
layout of the %%PKGNAME%% files has been completely reworked. You
will need to modify your apache configuration and merge the settings
from your original configuration file:

    %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIRX%%/config.php

 to

   %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/config/config.php
