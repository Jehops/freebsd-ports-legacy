    phpLDAPadmin has been installed into:

       %%PREFIX%%/%%WWWDIR%%

    Please copy config.php.example to config.php and edit to suit
    your needs.

    To make phpLDAPadmin available through your web site, I suggest
    that you add the following to httpd.conf:

       Alias /phpldapadmin/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%WWWDIR%%/"

    You will need a version of PHP with LDAP functionality enabled,
    which is not the default.  If necessary, enable the 'OPENLDAP'
    option in the www/mod_php4 port's configuration screen and
    reinstall PHP.
