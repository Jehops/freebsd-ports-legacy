vls -- the VideoLAN Server

The vls is distributed with a GPL license.  See the file COPYING in the
base directory.

The vls is part of the VideoLAN project, a full client/server
solution for video streaming using multicast or unicast.

The VideoLAN web site at http://www.videolan.org/ is a good start for
information about MPEG and DVD playing. Have a look at the documentation
section (http://www.videolan.org/doc/), as well as the bookmarks.
