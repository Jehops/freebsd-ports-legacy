MiniDLNA (aka ReadyDLNA) is server software with the aim of being
fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients.

The media files are listed in an SQLite database allowing prompt
restarts.

Only Linux BINARY releases are available from the author(s) at this
time, so this port builds from a dated snapshot of the CVS-tree.
