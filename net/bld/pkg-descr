BLD stands for "black list daemon" and is intended to build blacklists
using simple rules based on a maximum number of submissions of the same
IP address during a minimum time interval.  BLD was primarily designed to
fight against dictionnary-based spams (by making the MTA report to BLD
any host that tries to send a mail to an unknown user) but can be used  
by any application that needs a blacklist based on connection rate
limits.
