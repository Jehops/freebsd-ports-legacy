nss_ldapd is a NSS module which provides an LDAP backend for C library
functions such as getpwnam(3), getgrnam(3), and gethostbyname(3).  It
is compliant with RFC 2307, ``An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network
Information Service''.

Key differences from nss_ldap:
* lighter nss library (no ldap* dependings)
* server-side connection caching
