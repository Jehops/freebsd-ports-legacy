Apache SOAP is an open-source implementation of the SOAP v1.1 and SOAP
Messages with Attachments specifications in Java. Apache SOAP is developed
by the Apache SOAP community.


Apache SOAP can be used as a client library to invoke SOAP services
available elsewhere or as a server-side tool to implement SOAP accessible
services. As a client library it provides an API for invoking SOAP RPC
services as well as an API for sending and receiving SOAP messages. As a
mechanism to write new RPC accessible services or message accessible
services, it expects to be hosted by a servlet container (such as Apache
Tomcat, for example). While the codebase can be extended to support non-HTTP
transports, the provided code only has limited support for non-HTTP
transports (specifically, only for SMTP).
