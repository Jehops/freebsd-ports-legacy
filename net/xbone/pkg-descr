X-Bone dynamically deploys and manages Internet overlays to reduce 
their configuration effort and increase network component sharing. 
X-Bone discovers, configures, and monitors network resources to 
create overlays over existing IP networks. 

X-Bone uses two-layer IP in IP tunneled overlays and supports existing 
applications and unmodified routing, multicast, and DNS services in 
unmodified operating systems. X-Bone also support IPSec within overlays.
