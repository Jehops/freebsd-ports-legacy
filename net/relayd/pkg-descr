relayd is a daemon to relay and dynamically redirect incoming
connections to a target host. Its main purposes are to run as a
load-balancer, application layer gateway, or transparent proxy. The
daemon is able to monitor groups of hosts for availability, which is
determined by checking for a specific service common to a host group.
