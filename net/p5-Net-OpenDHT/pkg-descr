The Net::OpenDHT module provides a simple interface to the Open DHT
service. Open DHT is a publicly accessible distributed hash table (DHT)
service. In contrast to the usual DHT model, clients of Open DHT do not
need to run a DHT node in order to use the service. Instead, they can
issue put and get operations to any DHT node, which processes the
operations on their behalf. No credentials or accounts are required to use
the service, and the available storage is fairly shared across all active
clients.

This service model of DHT usage greatly simplifies deploying client
applications. By using Open DHT as a highly-available naming and storage
service, clients can ignore the complexities of deploying and maintaining
a DHT and instead concentrate on developing more sophisticated distributed
applications.
