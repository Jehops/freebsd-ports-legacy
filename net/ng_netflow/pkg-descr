The ng_netflow node implements Cisco's Netflow (c) version 5 protocol
on router running FreeBSD.  ng_netflow listens for incoming traffic and
identifies unique flows in it. Flows are distinguished by endpoint IP
addresses, TCP/UDP port numbers and ToS. Expired flows are exported out
of the node.
All operation is done in kernel: both traffic capturing and export
datagram generation. Exported data contaion almost all Netflow version 5
fields, except of AS numbers.
