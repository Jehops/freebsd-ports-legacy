bpft is a superset of trafshow, and extends it by adding a daemon
which collects data about network connections (src, dst, protocol
and length). The resulting data can be dumped to a file for later
processing.

Read /usr/local/share/doc/bpft/README after installation for more
information.

To use bpft, your kernel must be rebuilt with the following line
added to your kernel config file (/sys/i386/conf/<YourMachine>):

pseudo-device   bpfilter        4       # Berkeley packet filter

The number after bpfilter is the number of interfaces that can be
examined simultaneously. See section 6.1 of the Handbook for details.
