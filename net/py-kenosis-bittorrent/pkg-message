	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read
/usr/local/share/doc/kenosis-BitTorrent/README_KENOSIS.txt.  It
contains important information about testing and configuring the
Kenosis enabled BitTorrent client and tracker, and ultimately
replacing the official client with this version.

Non-Kenosis clients can use Kenosis trackers without a problem AND
Kenosis clients can disable Kenosis suppport (I am not sure why
because you can use the non-Kenosis trackers with Kenosis enabled)
if that is desired.

It is fully compatible with current BitTorrent clients so it will
work with or without Kenosis support. This is a modified version
of the official stable BitTorrent distribution version 3.4.2.

In order to make sure this application does not interfere with
previously installed official BitTorrent clients while users perform
the transition, the installation has been customized.

The kenosis_BitTorrent python module files can be found under

/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/kenosis_BitTorrent

and

the BitTorrent scripts under

/usr/local/libexec/kenosis-BitTorrent

If you desire to use the kenosis-BitTorrent instead of the official
BitTorrent client, you should just place that directory in front
of PATH

- For sh based shells

$ export PATH="/usr/local/libexec/kenosis-BitTorrent:${PATH}"

- For csh based shells

$ setenv PATH "/usr/local/libexec/kenosis-BitTorrent:${PATH}"

Now, just use BitTorrent as usual. A file containing a copy of this
message is available as

/usr/local/share/doc/kenosis-BitTorrent/README-FreeBSD.txt
