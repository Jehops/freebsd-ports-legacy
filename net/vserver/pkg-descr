VChat is a fully featured internet conferencing (or chat-) system with
traditional commandline interface, support for ANSI colors, a builtin
user management system with per user assignable permission sets, server side
access control list support and a lot of other useful features. The open
architecture of the system and a range of existing client software that
suits most needs make it the ideal solution for setting up a conferencing
system for your website or network.

This port is the standard UNIX server software suite for setting up a VChat
conference system.

See ports/net/vchat for the client side components of the VChat system.
