****  To setup dhcpd, you may have to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.

****  This port installs dhcp daemon, but don't invokes dhcpd by default. If
      you want to invoke dhcpd at startup, put these lines into /etc/rc.conf.

	    dhcpd_enable="YES"
	    dhcpd_flags=""				# command option(s)
	    dhcpd_conf="%%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf"	# configuration file
	    dhcpd_ifaces=""				# ethernet interface(s)

****  For instance, rc.conf like variables are still read from
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf. They should be move into
      /etc/rc.conf.  Also, the dhcpd_options variable must be
      renamed dhcpd_flags.
