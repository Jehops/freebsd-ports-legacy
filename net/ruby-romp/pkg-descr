ROMP is the Ruby Object Message Proxy.  It is sort of like drb
(distributed Ruby) in that it allows a Ruby client program to
seamlessly talk to an object that is sitting on a server. However, it
has many distinct advantages over drb:

- Much faster, up to 40000 messages per second (compare to 50 messages
  per second for drb).

- Allows more than one object to reside on the server; supports a form
  for naming service for retriving references to objects.

- Fully thread-safe, provided the object sitting on the server is
  thread-safe.

- Supports oneway calls, so the client does not have to block waiting
  for a response from the server.

- Allows exceptions to be propogated from server to client; massages
  the backtrace to make debugging easier.
