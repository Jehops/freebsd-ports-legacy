ROMP is the Ruby Object Message Proxy.  It is sort of like drb
(distributed Ruby) in that it allows a Ruby client program to
transparently talk to an object that is sitting on a server.  Its
features include:

- Up to 40000 messages per second

- Allows more than one object to reside on the server; supports a sort
  for naming service for retrieving references to objects.

- Fully thread-safe, provided the object sitting on the server is
  thread-safe.

- Supports one-way calls, so the client does not have to block waiting
  for a response from the server.

- Allows exceptions to be propagated from server to client; messages
  the backtrace to make debugging easier.
