CAP - The Columbia AppleTalk Package for UNIX

CAP implements the AppleTalk protocol stack on a variety of UNIX
machines.  The main applications provide an AppleShare 2.0 compatible
server (aufs), a LaserWriter Spooler (lwsrv) and a program to print to
LaserWriters (papif).  The latter can be used to talk to EtherTalk
LaserWriters, LocalTalk LaserWriters used on Dayna EtherPrint cards or
on a LocalTalk/EtherTalk gateway.  There are also a number of
contributed packages bundled with CAP.
