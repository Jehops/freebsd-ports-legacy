The classes provided by this module implement direct TCP/IP communications
methods for both clients and servers.  The connections don't use HTTP or any
other higher-level protocol. These classes are selected when the client or
server object being created uses an endpoint URI that starts with tcp://. Both
client and server classes support using Secure Socket Layer if it is available.
If any of the parameters to a new method from either of the classes begins with
SSL_ (such as SSL_server in place of Server), the class attempts to load the
IO::Socket::SSL package and use it to create socket objects.
