To mount shares with LinNeighborhood, there are the following possibilities:
  - run it as root. (not recommended)
  - give LinNeighborhood the suid flag (not recommended)
  - give mount_smbfs and umount the suid flag (very bad!)
  - install and configure sudo correctly and replace mount_smbfs and umount
    in the preferences by "sudo mount_smbfs" and "sudo umount" (recommended).
    Make sure, that all sudo rules concerning mount and umount have the
    NOPASSWD flag. Otherwise two password questions might occur (one
    from sudo and one from mount_smbfs) which will definitely go wrong.
