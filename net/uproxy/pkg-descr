Initially UProxy has been designed to allow playing
Unreal Tournament matches over Internet on computers
connected by a LAN sharing a dial up connection, but
it could be used to play other games (such as Quake)
and by every program using a UDP protocol where clients
don't have to bind a fixed port (not only games!).
