Oooookay, so you have tinyfugue, and you want
it pretty, Well, here's your toy. This should
be -really- straightforward. If you've got this
out of cvs, run ./autogen.sh ; make  and you are
set.

PLEASE READ HACKING, if you are a developer.

If you got this from a dist, then, ./configure
should be what you need. Have fun,
