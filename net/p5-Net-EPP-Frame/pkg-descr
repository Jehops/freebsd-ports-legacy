EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 3730) is 
an application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and 
management of objects stored in a shared central repository. Specified in 
XML, the protocol defines generic object management operations and an 
extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects. As of 
writing, its only well-developed application is the provisioning of 
Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.

EPP uses XML documents called "frames" send data to and from clients and 
servers. This module implements a subclass of the XML::LibXML::Document 
module that simplifies the process of creation of these frames. It is 
designed to be used alongside the Net::EPP::Client module.
