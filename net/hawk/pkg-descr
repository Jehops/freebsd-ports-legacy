Hawk is a web based utility for monitoring and comparing hosts 
on your network with what's in DNS.  Hosts that are answering 
pings but are not in dns may be unauthorized, and hosts that are 
in DNS, but are not answering may be able to be reclaimed.  Hawk 
monitors all hosts on the networks you specify and lets you view
them via a web page.

Hawk consists of a backend written in perl that monitors hosts by
icmp pings and writes the status to a mysql database.  The frontend
is in php and lets you select which network to view, and how to view
it.
