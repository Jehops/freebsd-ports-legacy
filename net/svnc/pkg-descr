This is a VNC viewer for SVGAlib.

from the Web page:

   The viewer doesn't do any scaling or scrolling, so the desktop you
   connect to must be of a resolution supported by your SVGALIB setup.
   Try creating servers of different geometries and connecting to them -
   if your svgalib setup doesn't work for one resolution it may work for
   another.  Persevere - this has a lot of potential. You can use it to
   make a very lightweight graphics terminal with reasonable performance
   on low-end hardware.

   The current version will not generally be able to connect to Windows
   servers, because it requests a palette-based display which the Windows
   server cannot generate.

If you have problems, press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, or log in over the network and
kill the svncviewer process.
