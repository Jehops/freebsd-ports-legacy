proxy is a transparent TCP/IP proxy that listens for connections and forwards
bi-directional data with the ability to log the data to stdout or to files
within a specified directory.

proxy can log the data streams in three formats.  Which format to use (if any)
should be chosen according to the nature of the data being streamed.
