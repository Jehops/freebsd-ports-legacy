TiK is a pure Tcl/Tk 8.0 version of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM).  The 
TiK client began its life as a scaled down version of the native Windows 
and Macintosh clients.  However, TiK now has most of the features the 
native clients have, plus some extras.  TiK includes a graphical buddy 
list display plus packages for away messages, buddy pounce, buddy 
ticker, stock monitoring and IM capturing.  It is very easy for end users 
to add new features to TiK, using Tcl/Tk.  TiK is meant to give UNIX 
users an alternative to the Java client.

With TiK, you will be able to chat with AOL users.
