This library was created to allow a Ruby application to connect to an
existing Jabber account as an additional resource.

This is not meant to be a library to create a complete Ruby-based
Jabber IM client. It was written for ease of use, not completeness. It
does support:

* Account registration
* Connection to an account (plain-text/digest)
* Access to Roster (buddy list)
* Tracking of presence of resources in the Roster (including local
  account resources)
* Sending and receiving messages
* Managing subscriptions
* Pluggable xml parsers (rexml/xmlparser)
