%%PKGNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%

Please edit config.php and edit to suit your needs.

To make phpLDAPadmin available through your web site, 
I suggest that you add the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /phpldapadmin/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/"

You will need a version of PHP with LDAP functionality enabled,
which is not the default.  If necessary, enable the 'OPENLDAP'
option in the PHP port's configuration screen and reinstall.
