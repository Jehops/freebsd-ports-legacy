The purpose with TPTEST is to allow users to measure the speed of
their Internet connection in a simple way. TPTEST measures the
throughput speed to and from various reference servers on the
Internet. The use of TPTEST may help increase the consumer/end user
knowledge of how Internet services work.

TPTEST was originally developed by the Swedish ICT-commission, then
later by the Foundation for Internet Infrastructure (iis.se), the
Swedish Consumer Agency (konsumentverket.se), and the Swedish National
Post- and Telecom Agency (pts.se). The latest development has been to
separate the platform-independent test method software (the test
engine) from the platform-dependent user interface software in order
to make it easier for anyone to write a test client or server that
uses the TPTEST testing method. The test engine code is to be regarded
as a library module and is released under the LGPL license while the
reference client/server applications is released under the GPL
license.
