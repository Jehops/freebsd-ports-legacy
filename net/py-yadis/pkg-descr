Python YADIS
------------

This code implements relying party support for the Yadis service discovery
protocol.  The protocol was developed for use by decentralized URL-based
identity systems, but is useful for advertising services provided by or on
behalf of a certain URL.

The module yadis.xrires also provides a method of resolving XRI.

The JanRain Python OpenID library uses this library for discovery of OpenID
service endpoints.  See that library for an example of library usage.
