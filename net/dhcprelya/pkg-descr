dhcprelya is a light DHCP relay agent written for Yandex company for
high loaded routers with tens interfaces and thousands hosts behind them.

It's fast and does not depend on any side library. Some ideas was
taken from Edwin's dhcprelay (net/dhcprelay) which has some shortages.

It's distributed under BSD license.

How to run:

dhcprelya [-d] [-p<pidfile>] -i<if1>... -i<ifN> <server1>... <serverN>

-d	- do not demonize and output debugging info onto terminal.
-p	- use not default pid file. You can run more than one copy of
	  dhcprelya.
-i	- an interfaces list these should be listened.
server	- a servers list where request will be forward to.

Any questions, bug reports and feature requests are welcome.
