PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a protocol used
by many ADSL service providers. Roaring Penguin's PPPoE software
is a reliable program for connecting unix systems to PPPoE service
providers without requiring any kernel patches.

It currently does not work under FreeBSD. It is being provided in
the hope that the community may help get it working.
