XORP is the eXtensible Open Router Platform.

The XORP project is developing an open source software router. The software
is intended to be stable and fully featured enough for production use, and
flexible and extensible enough for research use.  The software is covered by
a mixture of LGPLv2 / GPLv2 licenses, and the code is publicly available,
allowing for production deployment and commercial development.

This port is for the latest SVN version of XORP.
