WiStumbler2 is a fork of original wistumbler caused by the incommunication
of the original author, because seems that development was getting stopped.

In the fork of wistumbler I add some new features and bugfixes.

Diff on wistumbler:
 - gtk2 support.
 - some gtk widgets wasn't correctly used.
 - Support for console mode (no X needed).
 - Allow log-saving on the fly (new button).
 - Patches some GPS pointers that segfaults.
 - 0 warnings with -Wall on gcc3.3 on NetBSD-current.
 - Speaker beeps like windows-stumbler. (ear-wardriving)
