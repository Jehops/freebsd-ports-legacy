+ This is the core distribution of DGD, providing all the tools needed to
+ implement a MUD server, except for the "mudlib" which must be obtained
+ separately or written from scratch. Normally with DGD, the mudlib exists
+ as two distinct layers -- one to define the programming environment, and
+ the other is the actual programmed "world" that is interacted with.
+ 
+ Mudlib simulations are available for LPmud and LambdaMoo environments.
+ Other such simulations are in various stages of development.
