+ This is the core distribution of DGD, providing all the tools needed
+ to implement interactive servers, for instance MUD, IRC, WWW, etc.
+ A reference implementation of a kernel library is provided, which can
+ be further built on. Normally with DGD, there is a kernel library to
+ define the programming environment and a database library to define the
+ interaction environment.
+ 
+ Mudlib simulations are available for LPmud and LambdaMoo environments.
+ Other such simulations are in various stages of development.
