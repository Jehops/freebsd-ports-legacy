NQS (or more properly Generic NQS) is a Network Queuing System available
for multiple platforms.
It provides for configurable limits on jobs on a per queue basis as well
as for the total queue system.
As its name suggests it allows jobs to be submitted on one machine and
transferred to run on another machine. It can be configured so jobs are
automatically transferred to the least loaded machine in the cluster.
