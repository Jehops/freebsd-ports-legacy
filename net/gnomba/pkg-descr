Gnomba is a stab at writing a GUI machine and share browser for the smb
protocol.  Gnomba allows you to scan any number of subnets for machines
with smb.  The workgroups, machines and share are shown in a tree-view.
For each machine you can then view the list of shares, and mount, unmount
or browse them.
