Centericq is a text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface that
supports the ICQ2000, Yahoo!, AIM, MSN and IRC protocols. It allows you
to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes, contacts, and email
express messages. It also lets you set your own and fetch others' away
messages, and define external handlers for incoming events. You can
mass message-send, search for users, view users' details, maintain
your contact list directly from the program, view the message history,
register a new UIN and update your details, be informed upon receipt
of email messages, automatically set away after the defined period of
inactivity, and have your own ignore, visible, and invisible lists.
It can also associate events with sounds, make log of events, and
allows arrangement of contacts into groups.
