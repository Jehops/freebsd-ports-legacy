****  To setup dhcpd, you may have to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.  You also have to rename
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-\
      dhcpd.sh to enable automatic startup.
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf may be edited to tune some startup
      variables such as `dhcpd_options' or `dhcpd_ifaces', both defaulted
      to `nothing'. See dhcpd(8) for details about possible options.
