wmqmon allows you to keep an eye on any number of Quake 3 Arena
and Half-Life servers. This of course includes CounterStrike. The
display currently includes the ping time, number of players, and
the current map. Note that wmqmon does not interrogate a master
server for a list of running games. It is intended only to monitor
a collection of favorite servers that you set up by hand. The
default configuration file it reads from is $HOME/.wmqmon
