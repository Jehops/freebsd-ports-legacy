This is PPPTraf 1.0

PPPTraf is a ncurses program used to monitor bytes in/out over a PPP
connection. If ran on a router, and supplied with all IPs on the lan,
a table is drawn showing the bytes in/out (sent/received) for all
hosts on the LAN, and a total. This program was primarily written for
people that are charged by volume (bytes recieved).

I'm looking for feedback, as i have some big improvements planned.
