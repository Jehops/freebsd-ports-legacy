Beware of the IPv6 multicast functions.  Sending does work, but the
default interface effectively is invalid on *BSD.  A specific interface
needs to be provided rather than leaving interface blank (zero).

Multicast receiving may not currently work.  The test for IPv6 multicast
fails.  The test chunk is sent (verified with separate monitoring tool)
but never detected.  Hopefully the cause will be understood and fixed
soon.

AF_NETLINK and AF_PACKET protocols are not supported by *BSD, so the
associated tests have been removed.  Every test other than IPv6 Multicast
passes.  You may want to replace "em0" with this system's interface in
the test suite is to be run (see files/patch-tests_socket__tests.adb).
