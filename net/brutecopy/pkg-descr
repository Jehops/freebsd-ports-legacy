It's an application that pushes data using UDP protocol through rotten,
overloaded and otherwise disgusting lines. It should work well even on lines
on which TCP completely chokes. The transmission is performed at
user-preprogrammed fixed data rate with no flow control, only with lost-packet
retransmits. Brutalcopy always transfers the file without error, even on
erroneous lines. It uses a CRC-32 checksum algorithm together with the checksum
in the UDP packets.

Warning: using this utility can cause total line congestion. Don't use it on
with high transfer rates unless you know what you do. On some routers, the
UDP is artificially throttled in order to prevent such practices. Use
FSP for more user and bandwidth friendly file transfers.
