*** ATTENTION ***

You must create a %%PREFIX%%/etc/ifstated.conf file (a sample is
provided).  To run ifstated from startup, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

ifstated_enable="YES"


Available variables you can set in /etc/rc.conf:

- ifstated_enable (bool):      Set to "NO" by default.
                               Set it to "YES" to enable ifstated.
- ifstated_flags (str):        Set to "-f %%PREFIX%%/etc/ifstated.conf" by default.
                               Extra flags passed to start command.
