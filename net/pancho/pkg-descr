Pancho was written with the goal of allowing network
admnistrators make a change to a group of Cisco routers
without being required to log into each host. 

Pancho also provides the flexibility to allow admins to
use its function against a single host, a select group
or the entire whole. In addition to changes to current
configurations on remote routers, pancho is also capable
of archiving router configurations manually or through
automated runs.
