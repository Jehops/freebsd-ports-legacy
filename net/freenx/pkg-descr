NoMachine NX is the next-generation X compression and roundtrip suppression 
scheme. It can operate remote X11 sessions over 56k modem dialup links or 
anything better. 

This package contains a free (GPL) implementation of the nxserver component,
which is a front-end (auth/session management) for the nxserver back-end 
compression libraries.
