	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read
/usr/local/share/doc/mldonkey-perlreactor/README. It contains
important information about configuring perlreactor.

This port/package merely installed the program, you now need to
both configure and enable it.

If your mldonkey runs on a different machine than the script or if
you have set a http-password, you have to edit the top of the script
to make it work.
