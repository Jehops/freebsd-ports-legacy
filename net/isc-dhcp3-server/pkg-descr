ISC-DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server

This is a release of the Internet Software Consortium
DHCP Server (ISC dhcpd).  In this release, support for the core
DHCP protocol is provided.  BOOTP support is also provided for
backwards compatibility. 

Version 3 of the ISC DHCP Distribution adds conditional behaviour,
address pools with access control, and client classing.  An interim
implementation of dynamic DNS updates for the server only is
included, but is not supported. 

Features in upcoming releases, starting with 3.1, will include the
final asynchronous Dynamic DNS Support, DHCPv4 16-bit option codes,
asynchronous DNS query resolution, DHCP Authentication, and support
for a DHCP Interserver Protocol and live querying and update of the
DHCP database.
