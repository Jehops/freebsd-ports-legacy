ISC-DHCP (BETA 0) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server and client

This is the first Beta release of the Internet Software Consortium
DHCP Server (ISC dhcpd).  In this Beta release, support for the core
DHCP protocol is provided.  BOOTP support is also provided for
backwards compatibility. 

This release of dhcpd does not contain support for DHCPINFORM.
Support for DHCPINFORM will be present in the next release.
DHCPINFORM is somewhat tangential to the main purpose of the DHCP
protocol, so this probably won't be a major problem for most users.
