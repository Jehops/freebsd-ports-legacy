****  To setup dhclient, you may need to edit /etc/rc.conf to bypass the
      base system dhclient, such as :
            dhcp_program="%%PREFIX%%/sbin/dhclient"
            dhcp_flags="-q"
      See dhclient(8) using the following command for details about the
      possible options:
            MANPATH=%%MAN1PREFIX%%/man man 8 dhclient
      
****  To setup dhcpd, you may need to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.  Also, you have to rename
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-
      dhcpd.sh.
      
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf may be edited to tune some startup
      variables such as `dhcpd_options' or `dhcpd_ifaces', both defaulted
      to nothing. See dhcpd(8) for details about the possible options.
      
****  To setup dhcrelay, you have to rename %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-
      dhcrelay.sh.sample to %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcrelay.sh.
      
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcrelay.conf may need to be edited to setup
      the `dhcrelay_servers' as required. you may also tune `dhcrelay_options'
      and `dhcrelay_ifaces', both defaulted to nothing, if needed. See
      dhcrelay(8) for details about the possible options.
