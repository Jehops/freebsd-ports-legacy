****  To setup dhcpd, you may have to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.

****  This port installs dhcp daemon, but don't invokes dhcpd by default. If
      you want to invoke dhcpd at startup, put these lines into /etc/rc.conf.

	    dhcpd_enable="YES"				# dhcpd enabled?
	    dhcpd_flags="-q"				# command option(s)
	    dhcpd_conf="%%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf"	# configuration file
	    dhcpd_ifaces=""				# ethernet interface(s)
	    dhcpd_withumask="022"			# file creation mask

****  If compiled with paranoia support (the default), the following lines
      are also supported:

	    dhcpd_chuser_enable="YES"			# runs w/o privileges?
	    dhcpd_withuser="dhcpd"			# user name to run as
	    dhcpd_withgroup="dhcpd"			# group name to run as
	    dhcpd_chroot_enable="YES"			# runs chrooted?
	    dhcpd_devfs_enable="YES"		      # use devfs if available?
	    dhcpd_makedev_enable="YES"		      # use MAKEDEV instead?
	    dhcpd_rootdir="/var/db/dhcpd"		# directory to run in
	    dhcpd_includedir="<some_dir>"		# directory with config-
							  files to include
	    dhcpd_flags="-early_chroot"			# needs full root

      WARNING: -early_chroot requires a jail(8) like environment to work.

      WARNING: dhcpd_devfs_enable and dhcpd_makedev_enable are mutually
               exclusive 
               dhcpd_makedev_enable make NO sense on FreeBSD 5.x and up!

****  If compiled with jail support (the default), the following lines are
      also supported (-early_chroot and dhcpd_chroot_enable=YES are implied):

	    dhcpd_jail_enable="YES"			# runs imprisoned?
            dhcpd_hostname="<hostname>"			# jail hostname
            dhcpd_ipaddress="<ip address>"		# jail ip address

      WARNING: dhcpd_rootdir needs to point to a full jail(8) environment.

****  WARNING: never edit the chrooted or jailed dhcpd.conf file but
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf instead which is always copied where
      needed upon startup.

****  WARNING: %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf is obsolete.  rc.conf like
      variables are still read there but should be moved /etc/rc.conf or
      /etc/rc.conf.d/dhcpd instead.  Also, the dhcpd_options variable must
      be renamed dhcpd_flags if any.
