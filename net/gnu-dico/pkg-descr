Dico is an implementation of DICT server (RFC 2229).  It is fully
modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
functionality, but it knows nothing about database formats.  Actual
searches are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules.  A
single module can serve one or more databases.  The package includes
the following database modules: dictorg, guile, python, and outline.
