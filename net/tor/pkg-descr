[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that
want to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using
Tor can help you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant
messaging, IRC, SSH, and more. Tor also provides a platform on which
software developers can build new applications with built-in
anonymity, safety, and privacy features.
