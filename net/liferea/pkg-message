NOTE THAT 0.4.8 BREAKS DOWNWARD COMPATIBILITY.

When upgrading to 0.4.8 the cache directory structure and the save mechanism
of the feed list will be changed. After the automatic conversion older
versions of Liferea cannot read the cache anymore and the won't see the
converted feed list anymore. To be prepared for problems please export the
feed list using the older version of Liferea! In case of problems you can
reinstall the older version and import the backup feed list.
