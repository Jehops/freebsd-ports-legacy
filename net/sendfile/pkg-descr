SAFT (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) is a new Internet protocol for
sending files and messages asynchronously.  This is useful, because you don't 
have to log on to the receiving site to do it.  You simply tell the
sendfile program a file name and where to send it:
"sendfile your_file user@somedomain" (Of course there are options).

The package includes: A sendfile client (which sends files), a sendmsg
client (which sends messages), a receive client (which copies files from
the local sendfile spool to the recipient's current directory) and a
sendfiled server (which receives files and messages and stores them in the
local sendfile spool).
