To use imq-client in your Java application you need to add following jars
to your classpath:

%%JAVAJARDIR%%/imq.jar - Connector to IMQ broker. REQUIRED.
%%JAVAJARDIR%%/jms.jar - JMS 1.1 API classes. MOST LIKELY NEEDED
			 If you have only one jms provider used in
                         your application or not using application
                         server you will need this. Otherwise other
                         jms provider will most likely to ship this.
%%JAVAJARDIR%%/fscontext.jar - JDNI file based lookups. OPTIONAL
