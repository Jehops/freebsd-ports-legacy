Citrix(R) Presentation Server(TM) runs on Microsoft(R) Windows
Server(TM) and UNIX(R) operating systems, and extends the base
Windows Terminal Services platform by enhancing the end-user
experience as well as increasing manageability, compatibility,
security and scalability to address business-critical environments.
Presentation Server expands the range of supported applications to
include legacy software and Web-based, UNIX and Java solutions. It
also enables any device or operating system including Macintosh and
Linux to access virtualized applications. Other important capabilities
are powerful management and configuration tools and faster, more
flexible printing.

You will need to create the directory ${LINUXBASE}/dev or risk
crashing your system.

If your Citrix server does not have one of the supplied root-certificates,
you can copy the certificate to /usr/ports/distfiles and add the
following line to your /etc/make.conf:

	ICA_CERTS=mycert.crt

It will then automatically be installed and removed with the normal
FreeBSD package tools.
