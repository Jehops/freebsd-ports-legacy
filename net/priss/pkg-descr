PRISS -- The Portable RT[S]P Internet Streaming Server

This is a port of Apple Computer's open source rtsp/rtp server which
streams live content.

With the advent of free, standards based media servers, the industry
is poised to take off. RTP/RTSP are two standards based protocols
which allow many vendors to interoperate. Apple Computer has released
an Open Source server based upon these protocols to support QuickTime 4
streaming media and other RTP/RTSP clients. This server is known as
the Darwin Streaming Server which currently runs on the MacOS X Server
platform. PRISS is a project which is based upon the Darwin source and
provides a Un*x-based server. 

Apple's QuickTime client can use a variety of high-quality new codecs
such as the Sorensen Video codec and the QDesign audio codec. To use these
new codecs, you will need to use a server that supports their use such as
Darwin or PRISS.
