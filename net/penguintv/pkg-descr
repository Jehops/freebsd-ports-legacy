PenguinTV is not just another RSS feed reader. It is designed from
the ground up to work seamlessly with podcasts and video blogs,
allowing you to easily enjoy the audio, music, and video published
around the web in RSS format.

Until now, the only solutions for listening to podcasts on Linux
have been clunky apps and unreliable bash scripts. Many solutions
require the user to browse file directories named by date to find
media files. With the large amount of information in podcasts and
videos, a user needs help to keep track of everything.

PenguinTV eliminates all of these problems with a light-weight but
powerful interface that shows you what you need to know, and hides
what you don't. You can immediately see what you've watched, what's
available to view, and which media are downloading. You don't have
to worry about where files are stored, what their names are, or
what format they are in. Rather than try to reinvent the wheel by
coding its own media player, PenguinTV launches the media player
of your choice to view your downloads.
