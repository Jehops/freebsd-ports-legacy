The Spread package provides a simple wrapper around the spread toolkit. We 
try to provide a much higher level wrapper. By providing:

    - Simple methods to send serialised Perl structures between programs
    - Callback registration
    - Extensible callbacks for command driven programs
    - Lots of accesor functions
    - Handling of incoming messages is supported via callbacks or
    via direct polling for input. Its your choice :-)
