An example of a more complex setup file can be found in
%%PREFIX%%/share/examples/torsocks/

Once you have installed torsocks, just launch it like so: 
	usewithtor [application] 

So, for example you can use ssh to a some.ssh.com by doing: 
	usewithtor ssh username@some.ssh.com -l <user>

or launch pidgin by doing: 
	usewithtor pidgin
