Introduction
============

  This is a port of brouted. brouted is dynamic routing daemon 
  acting on source IP address of TCP connections. It's purpose 
  is to use multiple routing only TCP/IP leased line only with 
  a single host.


How it works
============

  It checks PCB(Protocol Control Block) and kernel routing ta-
  ble. If dedicated source IP appears in PCB, brouted checks 
  whether it's destination IP address exists in kernel routing 
  table. If it doesn't exists, brouted add new routing entry
  which routes destination IP to dedicated gateway.

  In similar manner, when the TCP connection drops, correspond-
  ing routing entry is removed from kernel routing table.
