Kopete is a flexible, extensible, plugin-based,
multiple-protocol instant messaging system. Its
goal is to provide (i) users with a standard and
easy-to-use interface for all their instant
messaging systems, and (ii) developers with a
consistent and flexible framework for creating
plugins for different protocols.
