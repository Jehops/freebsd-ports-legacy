This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (AOL Instant MEssenger, Web
browser, HTML editor, mail user agent and news reader).  Using the Linux
version on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Macromedia Flash
plugin is included in this port.  The German and French region packs, personal
security manager, spell-checker, and talkback are available.  When the browser
is installed, AOL Instant Messenger is installed too.
