This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (AOL Instant Messenger, Web
browser, HTML editor, mail user agent and news reader).  Using the Linux
version on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java and
Macromedia Flash plugins are included in this port.  The German and French
region packs, personal security manager, spell-checker, and talkback are
available.

For use with the Java plugin, linux_base-61 or linux_base-62 are
recommended (not linux_base-7).
