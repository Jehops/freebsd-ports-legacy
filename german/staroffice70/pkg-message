StarOffice 6.0 Personal Install How-To

------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this a a BETA RELEASE of Staroffice6.0

------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:

We have found a workaround for the install-user segfaults.
The installation does not create serveral .dat files, which
leads to segfaults and startup problems.

WARNING:

If you have already Staroffice5.2 installed and your work
directory is a symlink to somewhere else and you do a upgrade,
all your files in this directory will be lost ! Please make
a backup of these files or the entire $HOME/office52 folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You will very shortly have finished  a network install of
StarOffice 6.0. Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as
the user that you usually use. Then run "make install-user" and
do a standard workstation install. Change the install path to
$HOME/staroffice6.0. Then add $HOME/staroffice6.0/ to your path.

It will now be ready to use.

Good Luck
