                  **** NOTE ****
        Before the first use of WordPress, copy wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php
        in ${PREFIX}/${WORDPRESS}
        And Modify it to fit your MySQL.
        Maybe you need 'mysqladmin create wordpress' first

        If you are upgrading from 1.x or 2.0 to 2.1, please run
        http://your.site/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php to upgrade to WordPress 2.1
