Plucker is an offline HTML viewer for PalmOS devices packaged with UNIX and
Linux conduits.  An included set of scripts will spider HTML pages which you
specify to a supplied depth, and parse them on your desktop machine. Those
webpages are processed there and transferred to the Palm for viewing by
Plucker.
