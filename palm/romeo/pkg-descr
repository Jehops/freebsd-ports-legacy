With Romeo, you can construct custom PalmOS ROM images with extra
applications of your choice and without any of the default applications
that you never use. This can be extremely useful if your Palm doesn't
have much RAM, or if you are deploying an application to, say, a sales
team and want to make it as user-proof as possible. There's almost 600K
of unused space on a typical Palm ROM, and you can be taking advantage
of it.
