pdbc is a compiler that converts a source file into a Palm DataBase (PDB) file
or Palm Resource (PRC) file.  The language the pdbc compiler understands is
designed to be easy to understand and write.  Yet it is powerful enough to give
the freedom to describe the binary content of the database records in a variety
of ways.  It is also easy to generate the pdbc source file from another
language (e.g.  Perl).

In addition to the pdbc tool there is also pdbdec.  pdbdec is a decompiler
which converts any PDB or PRC file into a pdbc source file.  This is useful to
check the correctness of the pdbc generated file and to analyze other PDB
files.

pdbc and pdbdec are command line tools.
