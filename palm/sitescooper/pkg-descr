Sitescooper automatically retrieves the stories from several news
web sites, trims off extraneous HTML, and converts them into formats
you can read on your Palm computing device for later reading
on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've
already read. Sitescooper can support any format with a text converter
including: HTML, iSilo and Doc format.
