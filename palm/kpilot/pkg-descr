KPilot is software for syncing the 3Com Palm Pilot and IBM
Workpad (UNTESTED!) with a machine running some flavor of unix. The
actual PC->PP communcations was originally based on pilot-link.0.8.7.
By default it attempts to connnect using /dev/pilot which should be a
link to the actual serial port, however this is configurable in the
settings dialog. 

This is the fouth release of KPilot.  The major change in this 
release is conduit support.  There are currently two included
conduits, a KOrganizer conduit (vcal syncing) and a PopMail conduit
(this fixes the email bug with KPilot 2.1).  Also fixed in this
release is the Address/Memo "off by one" bug.  This release _REQUIRES_ 
KDE Beta 4 or better.  Please see:

for more information on the conduits and requirements.
