The purpose of the SynCE project is to provide a means of communication with
a Windows Mobile device from a computer using USB or Bluetooth.
Synce-serial is a set of wrappers around pppd to initiate communications
with a Windows Mobile device. Once a connection is established, synce-vdccm is
able to accept connections.
