This is the Linux version of the HanDBase desktop software.  It's
purpose is to translate between HanDBase databases and files of
comma-separated data.  It does not include the graphical front-end of
the Windows version, but it does have all of the functionality.

Formerly it was located at
http://www.SilberSoft.com/Software/Database/HanDBase/HBDesk.html,
but it does not seem to be on that site as of October 2003.
