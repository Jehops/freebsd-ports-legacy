This is a bare bones utility to enable people who have Palm OS 
devices to sync to Mobile Application Link (MAL) compliant servers. 
AvantGo (www.avantgo.com) and Puma Technologies (www.pumatech.com) 
are the first two companies committing to producing servers which speak 
this protocol. This utility will allow a user to sync with multiple servers,
simultaneously or separately. The AvantGo.com service (www.avantgo.com) 
is the first such server.   

There is currently no way to set server parameters on the desktop; you 
need to use the MobileLink application on the device. 

MALSync only operates from the command line.  If you want to build it
into some Unix-based, HotSync-like GUI, more power to you.
