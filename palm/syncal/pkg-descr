       Syncal  reads  a  current  ical calendar file, an archived
       ical calendar file from the last time syncal was run,  and
       a  Palm  device DateBook database and reconciles them.  It
       creates a new ical calendar file which replaces  both  the
       current and archived ones and updates the Pilot DateBookDB
       to coincide with them.

       Once syncal is started, the user must  invoke  HotSync  on
       the target device.
