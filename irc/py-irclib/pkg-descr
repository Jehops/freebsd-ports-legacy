This library is intended to encapsulate the IRC protocol at a quite 
low level.  It provides an event-driven IRC client framework.  It has  
a fairly thorough support for the basic IRC protocol and CTCP, but DCC 
connection support is not yet implemented. It actually does CTCP
parsing exactly as the CTCP specifications describe it.
