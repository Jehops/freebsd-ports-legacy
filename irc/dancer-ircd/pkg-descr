This is the ircd designed for use on freenode.net, based on the hybrid
ircd used by efnet.

This port/package is configured for use on a small network or
standalone, and the escape code filter is disabled.  To use it on a
large and/or Western language only network, please re-configure
config.h and rebuild.
