dancer-ircd has now been installed.

Please configure /usr/local/etc/dancer-ircd/ircd.conf to suit your
needs, and you may then start the server by running:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/dancer-ircd.sh start

To make it automatically run on (the next) startup, you must add
``dancer_ircd_enable=YES'' to /etc/rc.conf.
