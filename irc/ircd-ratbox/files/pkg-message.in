ircd-ratbox has been successfully installed.

Sample 'ircd.conf' and 'ircd.motd' files have been created in the
ircd-ratbox configuration directory. A sample configuration file is
included for EFNet-like configurations that can be used instead. You
should now edit these files as per the ratbox documentation.
A configured ircd.conf file is required to start the server.

Once you have added ircd_ratbox_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf, the
server can be started by running:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox start

If you specified options for ircd-shortcut commands, these will have
been added and the module included in the contrib module directory.
You may wish to add an entry to your ircd.conf file for this module to
be loaded when your IRCD starts.

Be sure to check out 'ratbox-services' if you need a services package.
