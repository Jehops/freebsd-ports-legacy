Supybot is installed. 

For a quick start create a new directory from which to run
your bot and run the supybot-wizard command from within it
to create a config file and subdirectories.

If you are want to use the Factoids, GrabQuote, Words (and
possibly a few other) plugins, you need to install the
databases/py-PySQLite port.

For more information see the GETTING_STARTED document.
