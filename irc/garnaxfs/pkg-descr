Garnaxbot (File Server) is a file serving bot for IRC (commonly referred 
to as a DCC bot). It uses the DCC chat/send features of IRC to send files 
to other users. Garnaxbot will connect to an IRC server and allow people 
to request files via DCC chat. This is not a script, it is a standalone 
executable written in C.
