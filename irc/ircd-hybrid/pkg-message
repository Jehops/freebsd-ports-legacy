ircd-hybrid has now been installed.

You should now copy ${PREFIX}/etc/ircd/*.sample to
${PREFIX}/etc/ircd/*, and them to suit your needs.

Please note: you should copy _all_ the sample files to the corresponding
configuration file, even if you just leave it empty, otherwise ircd-hybrid
may refuse to start.

You may then start the server by running:

	${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/ircd.sh start
