ircd-hybrid has now been installed.

*** IMPORTANT: ***
- The old config format WILL NOT WORK
- The old kline format WILL NOT WORK
Please read the INSTALL file for more information.

You should now copy /usr/local/etc/ircd/*.sample to
/usr/local/etc/ircd/*, and them to suit your needs.

Please note: you should copy _all_ the sample files
to the corresponding configuration file, even if you
just leave it empty, otherwise ircd-hybrid may refuse
to start.

You may then start the server by running:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/ircd-hybrid.sh start
