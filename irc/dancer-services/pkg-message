dancer-services has now been installed.

You should now edit /usr/local/etc/dancer-services/services.conf and
make sure you have something like the following lines:

N:services.:Local services
S:<password X>:localhost:6667
O:*@127.0.0.1:<password hash>:<your nick>:segj

Then add the following lines to /usr/local/etc/dancer-ircd/ircd.conf:

C:127.0.0.1:foo:services.::2
N:127.0.0.1:<hash of password X>:services.::2

You may then start the servers by running:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/dancer-ircd.sh start
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/dancer-services.sh start

To make dancer-serives automatically run on (the next) startup, you
must add ``dancer_services_enable=YES'' to /etc/rc.conf.
