Note that xchat-gnome is very young project and is under heavy development.
You can consider xchat-gnome as alpha software, not that its unstable
but in lack of (not-yet) implemented features.

Xchat-gnome is a fork of the popular xchat irc client.
But the difference between the two is that xchat-gnome aims at better
gnome integration.
