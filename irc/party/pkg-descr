Party is a real-time chat program for Unix systems. It simulates a party
line, where any number of users can talk at the same time - if you type a
line of text, everyone else sees it immediately. 

Chat programs are pretty common these days. Party wasn't the first, but it
was an early one. It's antiquity is reflected in the fact that it doesn't
support networked systems especially well, nor have a web 
interface.  However, its maturity is reflected in the fact that it has a
clean and simple interface, and a good set of well-integrated features
that make it easy for first-timers to get into. It remains very popular to
this day on several systems.
