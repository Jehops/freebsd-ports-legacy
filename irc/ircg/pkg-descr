IRCG is a fast, scalable web chat framework that connects
a php frontend with an irc backend. Sascha Schumann created
IRCG a few years ago. Unfortunately, he decided to change the
license to a commercial one starting with Version 3 and
removed all traces of the BSD-Licensed IRCG 2. I kept on
using the IRCG 2 sources and never had a problem with this setup.
IRCG connects an irc server of your choice with a thttpd webserver.
Using PHP, the frontend can be scripted. It?s mainly a framework
for web-based chats, but could be used to pass any type of xml
messages between multiple clients. Memory and CPU usage per client
is quite low, so even an entry-level server can support hundreds of
clients.
