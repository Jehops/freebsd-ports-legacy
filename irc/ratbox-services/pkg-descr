ratbox-services is a services package written mostly from scratch for
use with ircd-ratbox.

It is highly configurable, with nearly all options being set in a config
that can be rehashed rather than set at compile time. It also uses the
SQLite database backend, which works as a database interface to a normal
file, meaning no seperate database software must be running.

Features:
	- User, nick and channel services
	- Jupe service
	- Global message service
	- Oper services
	- Opered bot
	- List service
