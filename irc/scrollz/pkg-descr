ScrollZ is a color-enabled IRC client written by 
Flier <flier@scrollz.com>. Its main difference from other
clients is that it implements many useful features that you
would normally find in a script, thus making it faster than
such scripts paired up with ircII.

It also has many unique features, such as three-line status
bars, CDCC (which has reget/resend ability), and its environment
is highly customizable.
