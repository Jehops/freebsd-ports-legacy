Welcome to Net::IRC, a work in progress. First intended to
be a quick tool for writing an IRC script in Perl,
Net::IRC has grown into a comprehensive Perl
implementation of the IRC protocol (RFC 1459), supported
and developed by several members of the EFnet IRC channel
#perl.

There are 4 component modules which make up Net::IRC:

Net::IRC

Net::IRC::Connection

Net::IRC::Event

Net::IRC::DCC

See their respective man pages for details.
