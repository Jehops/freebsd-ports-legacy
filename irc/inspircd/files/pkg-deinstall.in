The $inspircd_name port has been deleted.  If you are not
upgrading and don't intend to use $inspircd_name any more
then you may wish to delete the $inspircd_usr account,
and the $inspircd_grp group together with the configuration
directory ${etcdir}; which can be done with the
following commands:

    # pw userdel -n $inspircd_usr
    # rm -rf $etcdir
EOMSG
    echo
    ;;
esac
