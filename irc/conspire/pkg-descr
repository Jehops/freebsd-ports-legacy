Conspire is an advanced, lightweight IRC client for UNIX. It includes
a GTK interface, and a "bot" interface which has no UI. Interface
segregation is accomplished through libconspire, which contains the
common code. Conspire started as a fork of XChat 2.9 CVS.

Scripting is not yet officially supported, but is being worked on.
