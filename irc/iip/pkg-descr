[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

Invisible IRC Project (IIP) is a three-tier, peer distributed network
designed to be a secure and private transport medium for high speed,
low volume, dynamic content.

IIP is Internet Relay Chat privacy software designed for anonymity
and security. It acts as an advanced proxy between your IRC client
and servers by utilizing an encrypted mixnet with fake traffic and
three-layered (user, relay, and broadcast) protection.

IIP was originally created so that people interested in facilitating
privacy and free speech could work to these ends in an equally
secure and anonymous environment. It has now become a haven for
anyone seeking anonymous, encrypted Internet Relay Chat. The project's
inspiration arose primarily from a shared interest in the FreeNet
Project and a desire to provide the real-time communications
capabilities that FreeNet could not.
