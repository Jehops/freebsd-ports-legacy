Some of the ports in this directory have restrictive copyrights prohibiting
their actual redistribution on mass media.  When creating compilations
of FreeBSD on such mass media, you should be sure and NOT distribute
the original source tarballs for such ports in your distfiles directory.
To do so will invite needless problems from the various parties involved.

Since those connected to the net will also be able to use the ports framework
to automatically fetch their own original sources and thus complete the puzzle,
the hardship is not as severe as it might otherwise be.

Such ports are listed below:
