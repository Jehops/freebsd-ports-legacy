# Some of the ports in this directory have restrictive copyrights prohibiting
# their actual redistribution on mass media.  When creating compilations
# of FreeBSD on such mass media, you should be sure and NOT distribute
# the original source tarballs for such ports in your distfiles directory.
# To do so will invite needless problems from the various parties involved.
#
# Since those connected to the net will also be able to use the ports framework
# to automatically fetch their own original sources and thus complete the puzzle,
# the hardship is not as severe as it might otherwise be.
#
# Such ports are listed below:
