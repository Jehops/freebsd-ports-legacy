Some of the ports in this directory have restrictive copyrights prohibiting
their actual redistribution on mass media.  When creating compilations
of FreeBSD on such mass media, you should be sure and NOT distribute
the original source tarballs for such ports in your distfiles directory.
To do so will invite needless problems from the various parties involved.

Since those connected to the net will also be able to automatically fetch
their own original sources and complete the puzzle, the hardship is not as
severe as it might otherwise be.

Such ports are listed below:

Dist			Port			Why
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cku190.tar.gz		ports/comms/kermit	Restrictive copyright
pgp262s.zip		ports/utils/pgp*	Various locality restrictions
maxima-5.0-beta		ports/math/maxima	License required
rzsz3_36.zip		ports/comms/rzsz	Restrictive copyright
tkman-1.6.tar.Z		ports/x11/tkman		Restrictive copyright
xrisk-2.13.tar.Z	ports/games/xrisk	Copyright/trademark violation?
xtetris-2.5.2.tar.gz	ports/games/xtetris	Possible trademark violation
