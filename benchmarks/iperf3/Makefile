post-patch:
# automake generates a buggy Makefile.in that tries to do ${RANLIB} on
# libiperf3.a after installing with mode 444; this breaks staging.
# Since ${RANLIB} was already run on the library, this broken
# invocation was redundant, and can be eliminated.  The fix below is
# based on the solution for a similar situation for an unrelated port
# in r339298.
	@${REINPLACE_CMD} -e '/echo.*RANLIB/,+1d' ${WRKSRC}/src/Makefile.in
# Don't build stuff that we're not going to install.  Among other
# things this means we're not going to try to build profiled objects
# and/or executables.
