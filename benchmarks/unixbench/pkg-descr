The BYTE benchmark suite tests several aspects of system performance.

An article which describes the concepts and helps understand the results 
can be found in the doc directory (/usr/local/lib/bytebench/doc usually.)

This benchmark is quite prominent among Linux users, and there is a patched 
version available from some web suite from where results are made available, 
too.
Since they offer some results of non-Linux systems for comparison, they might 
be interested in FreeBSD reports, too ;-)

Quoting from "README.submittal" of the Linux version of this benchmark suite:
% Please e-mail test results along with platform info to:
% results@silkroad.com
% 
% Included CPU info, speed, RAM, and host adapter and bus
% info as well as any special compilation flags.

% results will be included in the URL:
