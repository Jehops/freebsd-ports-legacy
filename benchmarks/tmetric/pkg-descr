Tmetric is a (still raw) tool to aid in determining the available bandwidth
from one host to another. It is inspired by the (closed source) pathchar
utility. Please do not assume that this program works exactly like pathchar
does. It only attempts to report the bandwidth between 2 hosts, and not the
bandwidth available at every hop on a route along the way.

I've only tried compiling this on FreeBSD and Linux. There is some strange
behavior if your system has an outdated or limited FPU. My (oldassed) sparc
(this web server), for example, doesn't handle the floating point precision
types correctly for my tests. Oh well.
