SPECsfs2008: the SPEC NFSv3/CIFS benchmark

SPECsfs2008 is the latest version of the Standard Performance Evaluation
Corporation benchmark suite measuring file server throughput and response time,
providing a standardized method for comparing performance across different
vendor platforms. SPECsfs2008 results summarize the server's capabilities with
respect to the number of operations that can be handled per second, as well as
the overall latency of the operations. The suite is a follow-on to the SFS97_R1
benchmark, adding a CIFS workload, an updated NFSv3 workload, support for
additional client platforms, and a new test harness and reporting/submission
framework.

The ISO for SPECsfs2008 must be purchased from SPEC's web site, before
this port can be built.
