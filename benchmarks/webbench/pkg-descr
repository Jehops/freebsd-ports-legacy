webbench is very simple tool for benchmarking WWW or proxy servers. Uses fork()
for simulating multiple clients and can use HTTP/0.9-HTTP/1.1 requests. This
benchmark is not very realistic, but can test if your HTTPD can realy handle
many clients at once (try to run some CGIs) without taking your machine down.
Displays pages/min and bytes/sec.
