This Haskell library provides a powerful but simple way to measure the
performance of Haskell code. It provides both a framework for executing
and analysing benchmarks and a set of driver functions that makes it
easy to build and run benchmarks, and to analyse their results.

The fastest way to get started is to read the documentation and
examples in the Criterion.Main module.
