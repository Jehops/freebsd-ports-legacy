To use the Direct Rendering Infrastructure, you need to do the following:

- Enable agp support in your kernel, or load the agp kernel module at
  boot time. You can do this by editing /boot/loader.conf(5)
- Load the appropriate kernel module from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/kernel at
  boot time:
	- tdfx.ko	for 3Dfx cards
	- mga.ko	for Matrox G200/G400/G450
- Add the following lines to the "Module" section of your XF86Config:
	Load "glx"
