Common files for X True Type Servers.

I. INSTALL:
  For compiling this ports, you will need about 112 - 140
MBye free space on your HDD.

  XFree86 has many flags (such as "HasXdmAuth"), and they
are related to Xservers. For using them, this port read 
your configuration files in your ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/config/
except "host.def" file. File host.def will be generated 
by this port temporally. So you must write your own 
configuration flags to "xf86site.def" or "site.def".  
${PORTSDIR}/x11/XFree86 use xf86site.def. I recommend to 
use it.

II. CONFIGURATION
  After installing this ports, following instructions are
required.

1. extract your True Type Font to FONTDIR.
    # mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
    # cp *.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/

2. make font.dir file. mkfontdir.pl is a utility script.
    # cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/
    # mkfontdir.pl > font.dir

3. set FontPath in your XF86Config
    add following line to your XF86Config

    FontPath	"/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType"

4. restart your X server.

enjoy!
