Rubyful Soup is a Ruby port of the hit Python HTML/XML parser Beautiful Soup.
It's designed to be a useful quick-and-dirty parser for screen-scraping,
along the same lines as its parent:

1. Rubyful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup. It yields a parse tree
that makes approximately as much sense as your original document.
This is usually good enough to collect the data you need and then run away.

2. Rubyful Soup provides a few simple methods and Ruby-like idioms for
navigating and searching a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document
and extracting what you need. You don't have to create a custom parser for
each application. It's more flexible and easier to learn than XPath.
