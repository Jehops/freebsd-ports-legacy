                                 Apache / PHP

What is it?
-----------

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the NCSA
server version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and
includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which
allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.

This version includes support for the dynamic page language php,
which is a more comprehensive embedded language than SSI, with
built-in support for various databases (such as mSQL, mySQL, 
postgresql, Oracle, Sybase) and page counters.
