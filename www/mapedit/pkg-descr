What is mapedit?
================

mapedit is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for
imagemap files.

Imagemap files are a feature of both NCSA and CERN httpd servers;
they allow you to turn a GIF into a clickable map by designating
polygons, circles and rectangles within the GIF and specifying a
URL for each to link to.

Unfortunately, creating good image maps by hand is a lot of work,
because the points must be located using an editor not explicitly
designed for the purpose.

mapedit allows you to load your GIF image into a scrollable,
resizable window and then draw polygons, circles and rectangles on
top of it, specifying a URL for each. It also allows you to go back
and delete these "hot spots", set a default URL for clicks outside
of the "hot" areas, and so on. In addition, it allows you to
associate comments of arbitrary length with each object if you have
a server that accepts the NCSA imagemap format.

Please take a look at the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/mapedit/mapedit.html
for full usage documentation.
