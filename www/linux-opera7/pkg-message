Subject: Preview 3 of Opera 7.10 for Linux available
Date: 2003-04-03 03:12:15 PST

This is the first release ever that is synchronized with an Opera 
for windows release. Windows is released as 7.10 Beta 1 today and 
since we share the user interface and most of the other components 
we have jumped to the 7.10 tag as well (thus skipping 7.0). We have 
not has as much time to test this release compared with the windows 
version and we lack some linux specific features so we still name it
a Technology Preview.

Please discuss this release in the opera.linux newsgroup or opera-
linux mail list before submitting bugs to our BTS (Bug Tracking 
System). We recommend that you not install it over a current 
version of Opera.

Before you run Opera7:
   Since this is a beta it might be a good idea to backup your
   personal "~/.opera" directory and remove it. This can be done 
   from the command line using "cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup"  
   and "rm -rf ~/.opera".
