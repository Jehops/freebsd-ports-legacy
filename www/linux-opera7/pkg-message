Changelogs for 7.11 Final: http://www.opera.com/linux/changelogs/711/

If you are upgrade from version 6 final or 7 development, it might be a good
idea to backup your personal "~/.opera" directory and remove it. This can be
done from the command line using "cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup" and
"rm -rf ~/.opera".
