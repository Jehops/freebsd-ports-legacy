Campsite is a multilingual content management system (CMS) for news websites.

Campsite follows a print publication paradigm, so it structures sites
by default as Publications> Issues > Sections > Articles.
Campsite works best for medium-to-large-size online news publications,
but it is capable of handling smaller sites as well.
Some of its main features are ease of use, total design freedom for
web designers, built-in subscription support, automatic publishing,
easy article translation and internationalization.
