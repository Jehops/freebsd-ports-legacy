This module restricts access in the same way as an 'allow from'
does (it is derived form this module :), by checking for the exinstence of
a cookie. If a cookie is present it compares it to cookies found in a 
mySQL database. If it can find a equivalent cookie there, access is 
granted, else access is denied.
