Apache::Icon is a perl module that rips out the icon guts of mod_autoindex and
provides a perl interface for looking up icon images.  The motivation is to
piggyback the existing *AddIcon* and related directives for mapping file 
extensions and names to icons, while keeping things as small and fast as
mod_autoindex does.
