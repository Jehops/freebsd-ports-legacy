A mini-framework for Django for creating RESTful APIs.

Piston is a relatively small Django application that lets you
create application programming interfaces (API) for your sites.

It has several unique features:

 * Ties into Django's internal mechanisms.
 * Supports OAuth out of the box (as well as Basic/Digest or custom auth.)
 * Doesn't require tying to models, allowing arbitrary resources.
 * Speaks JSON, YAML, Python Pickle & XML (and HATEOAS.)
 * Ships with a convenient reusable library in Python
 * Respects and encourages proper use of HTTP (status codes, ...)
 * Has built in (optional) form validation (via Django), throttling, etc.
 * Supports streaming, with a small memory footprint.
