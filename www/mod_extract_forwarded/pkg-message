************************************************************
You've installed mod_extract_forward, an Apache module that
can make proxied requests appear with client IPs.

Edit your apache.conf or httpd.conf to enable and setup this
module. Have a look at the files in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_extract_forward for information on
how to configure it.

Then do this to make it work effective:

# apachectl configtest (see if there are any config errors)
# apachectl restart
