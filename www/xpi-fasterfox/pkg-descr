Fasterfox allows you to tweak many network and rendering
settings such as simultaneous connections, pipelining,
cache, DNS cache, and initial paint delay.

Dynamic speed increases can be obtained with the unique
prefetching mechanism, which recycles idle bandwidth by
silently loading and caching all of the links on the page
you are browsing.
