  If this is a first-time installation of RT::Extension::SLA, you will need
  to run the following in order to initialise various settings in the RT
  database:

     rt-setup-database --action insert --datafile \
         %%PREFIX%%/%%RTHOME%%/%%INITIALDATA%%

  This only ever needs to be run once.
