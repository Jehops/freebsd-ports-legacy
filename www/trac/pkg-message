From 0.10.x to 0.11.x
---------------------
You should be careful to check that the plugins you depend on have
been ported to 0.11, as they most probably won't work without adaptation
due to the numerous internal changes that occurred during 0.11 development.
Note however that Clearsilver based plugin are still supported.
