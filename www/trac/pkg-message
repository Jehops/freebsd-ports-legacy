The Trac database schema was changed between versions 0.8 and 0.9.  This
port also started to depend on PySQLite 2 (SQLite 3).

Existing environments must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.9.

Consult the upgrade instructions at:

	http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracUpgrade

You can also find the canonical upgrade instructions at:
