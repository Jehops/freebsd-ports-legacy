AOLserver is a highly-optimized multi-threaded web server. Its main
features include database connection-pooling and a powerful Tcl API
for application development.

The support for FreeBSD probably needs work, and I will gratefully
(and, it is to be hoped, promptly) accept patches or suggestions for
this port.

More information is available at www.aolserver.com.
