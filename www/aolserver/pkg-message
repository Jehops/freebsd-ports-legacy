Assuming you have changed to /usr/local, please copy
www/aolserver/nsd.tcl.sample to www/aolserver/nsd.tcl and season to
taste.  An example server is in at www/aolserver/servers/server1, and
you should similarly copy the contents of this directory to, e.g.,
www/aolserver/servers/www.mydomain.com before modifying them.
