Assuming you have changed to /usr/local, please copy
etc/aolserver3/nsd.tcl.sample to etc/aolserver3/nsd.tcl and season to
taste.  An example server is in at www/data/aolserver/servers, and you
should similarly copy the contents of this directory to, e.g.,
www/data/aolserver/servers/www.mydomain.com before modifying them.
