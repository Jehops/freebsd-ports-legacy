Assuming you have changed to %%PREFIX%%, please copy
aolserver/sample-config.tcl to aolserver/nsd.tcl and season to taste.
An example server is in at aolserver/servers/server1, and you should
similarly copy the contents of this directory to, e.g.,
aolserver/servers/www.mydomain.com before modifying them.

These files are examples only and will be deleted if you remove this
port.
