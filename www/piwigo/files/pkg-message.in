****************************************************************
The Piwigo Photo Gallery has been installed in the directory
%%WWWDIR%% 
with the documentation at 
%%DOCSDIR%% 
and the content of the tools directory at 
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%.

If this is a new installation, don't forget to verify that your
PHP configuration is OK and that you have an mySQL database.
The local.sample directory contains the empty structure 
used to store local configuration.

You must add appropriate configuration directives to your
apache configuration file (%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf).
A typical configuration would be:

    Alias /gallery/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%">
	AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
    </Directory>

For installation and upgrade information, check the readme file.
