                             Apache + SSLeay

Uses the public domain SSL implementation known as SSLeay, integrated into
the Apache server to provide a public domain HTTPS server using Netscape
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), versions 2 and 3.  There are licensing
issues in connection with use of the SSLeay code in the US, and there
are ITAR restrictions on export, even though the SSLeay code is obtained
from an overseas location.
