                       Apache 1.3.3 + SSLeay 1.28 (Apache-SSL)

Uses the public domain SSL implementation known as SSLeay, integrated
into the Apache server to provide a public domain HTTPS server using
Netscape Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), versions 2 and 3 and TLS version
1.  There are licensing issues in connection with use of the SSLeay
code in the US, and there are ITAR restrictions on export, even though
the SSLeay code is obtained from an overseas location.
