Horde is a framework used by several applications written in PHP.

Horde is used by these ports: mail/imp, mail/mimp, mail/turba,
devel/chora, deskutils/kronolith, deskutils/nag, mail/ingo, ftp/gollem
security/jeta, www/horde-passwd and deskutils/mnemo, .

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-port" that depends on other Horde packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the Horde stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency mechanism.
