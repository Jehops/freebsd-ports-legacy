Ziproxy is forwarding, non-caching, compressing HTTP proxy server.
Basically it squeezes images by converting them to lower quality JPEGs or 
JPEG 2000 and compresses (gzip) HTML and other text-like data.
It also provides other features such as: HTML/JS/CSS optimization, preemptive 
hostname resolution, transparent proxying, IP ToS marking (QoS), Ad-Blocker, 
detailed logging and more.
Ziproxy does not require a client software and provides acceleration for any 
web browser, any operational system.
