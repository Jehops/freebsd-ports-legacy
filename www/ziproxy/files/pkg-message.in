By default ziproxy is configured to accept connections on localhost only.
Edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/ziproxy.conf to allow remote access.

There is no man page yet, but information can be found in
%%DOCSDIR%%/README.

ziproxy can be started the following ways:
o daemon mode:
    * add ziproxy_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf
    * use rc(8) script %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ziproxy.sh
o inetd mode:
    * add ``http-proxy      8080/tcp   #HTTP Proxy'' to /etc/services
    * add ``http-proxy      stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/local/bin/ziproxy  ziproxy -i'' to your /etc/inetd.conf
    * reload inetd(8) config files by doing `/etc/rc.d/inetd reload`
