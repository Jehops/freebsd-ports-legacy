Dwoo is a PHP5 Template Engine that was started in early 2008. The idea came
from the fact that Smarty, a well known template engine, is getting older and
older. It carries the weight of it's age, having old features that are
inconsistent compared to newer ones, being written for PHP4 its Object Oriented
aspect doesn't take advantage of PHP5's more advanced features in the area,
etc. Hence Dwoo was born, hoping to provide a more up to date and stronger
engine. So far it has proven to be faster than Smarty in many areas, and it
provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using Smarty
for years to switch their application over to Dwoo progressively.
