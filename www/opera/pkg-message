If you are upgrading from version 6, it is recommended to backup your personal
"~/.opera" directory and remove it before starting the upgraded Opera for the
first time. This can be done from the command line using 
"mv ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup".

If you have installed the www/opera-devel port before, and you'd like to keep
the settings and bookmarks you used in opera-devel, move the opera-devel 
personal directory like this:
"mv ~/.opera-devel ~/.opera"

If you are running FreeBSD 5.x and are experiencing a core dump when starting
Opera, try updating the compat4x port.
