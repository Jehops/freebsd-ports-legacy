If you are running FreeBSD 5.x and are experiencing a core dump when starting
Opera, try updating the compat4x port.

*** IMPORTANT: users with custom search.ini ***

If you have a custom search.ini and you've used opera 7.51 or an earlier
version before this upgrade, edit ~/.opera/search.ini _before_ running the
upgraded Opera for the first time, and change the file version to 4. It should
look like this:

[Version]
File Version=4
