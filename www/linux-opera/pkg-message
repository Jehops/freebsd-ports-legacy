Changelogs for 7.23 Final: http://www.opera.com/linux/changelogs/723/

If you are upgrade from version 6 final, 7 development or 7.11, it might be a
good idea to backup your personal "~/.opera" directory and remove it. This can
be done from the command line using "cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup" and
"rm -rf ~/.opera".
