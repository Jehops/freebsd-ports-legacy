The Trean (Bookmarks) application allows you to store, organize and manage, and
most importantly access your web browser bookmarks on-line and in one central
place accessible from any web browser.

By storing your bookmarks here, you can access them from any browser on any
machine that can access the Horde applications. This means you can easily access
your bookmarks from multiple browsers, multiple machines, remote locations, etc.
And if you upgrade, switch, or test out browsers, you don't have to worry about
what happens to your bookmarks or how to import them into the new browser.
