From the website:

  The Toolserver Framework for Python is a framework for simple building of
  webservices. This is not Twisted - that one is much larger and much richer
  in features. If you need a full fledged webservice or internet protocol
  platform, you better go with Twisted. But if you need a lean and mean
  webservice machine, the Toolserver Framework for Python might be the right
  tool for the job.
