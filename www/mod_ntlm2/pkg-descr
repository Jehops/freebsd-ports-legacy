NTLM is an authentication protocol used by Microsoft Internet
Informations Server(tm) and Microsoft Internet Explorer(tm).  While it
is not really secure, it offers background authentication (the
workstation logon credentials of users are passed through to the web
server).  This feature is widely used in intranets based on these
Microsoft products.

This module is implementing NTLM authentication for Apache2 on Unix
platforms.
