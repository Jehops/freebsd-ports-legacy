The Tables API defined by TAPIr can be used by module developers to
include simple, dynamically configurable tables in their modules.
The tables generated by TAPIr feature dynamic loading of data but
also dynamic positioning and disabling of fields (columns) based on
settings configured in the table's settings page. Settings pages are
auto-generated and include helpful links to preview tables and view a
master tabel list. Tables defined by TAPIr are also extensible, so your
tables will be available for other module developers to hook into in a
method similar to the Forms API.
