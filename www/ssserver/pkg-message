SSServer is installed into /usr/local/www/cgi-bin by default. Make sure 
that your Web server (usually Apache) allows executing scripts in this 
directory.

To configure SSServer, run the Web-based configuration utility at
http://localhost/cgi-bin/ssserverdata/sssconf

You may find additional information in readme.htm and problems.htm files,
located in the ssserverdata subdirectory.
