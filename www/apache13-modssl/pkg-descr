Apache 1.3 + mod_ssl 2.0
========================

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the NCSA server
version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and includes
many frequently requested new features, and has an API which allows it to be
extended to meet users' needs more easily. This version is also SSL-aware by
the help of the mod_ssl module which interfaces Apache to the SSLeay
encryption library.

All the documentation can be found on-line on the Web:
