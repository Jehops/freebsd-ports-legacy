Nevow is a next-generation web application templating system, based on the ideas
developed in the Twisted Woven package. Its main focus is on separating the HTML
template from both the business logic and the display logic, while allowing the
programmer to write pure Python code as much as possible. It separates your code
into 'data' and 'render' functions, a simplified implementation of traditional
MVC. It has various parts which can be used individually or as a whole,
integrated web solution.
