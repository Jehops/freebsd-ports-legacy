After installing Firefox, you must su - to root, and run ``firefox'' before
running it as any other user.  If you do not su - to root, you may lose some
of your user settings.  If you try to run Firefox as a normal user without
first running it as root, the browser will not show up.  This is a known issue
with Firefox, and they hope to address it in a future release.
