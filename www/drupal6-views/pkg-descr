The views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site
designers to control how lists of content (nodes) are presented.
Traditionally, Drupal has hard-coded most of this, particularly
in how taxonomy and tracker lists are formatted.

This tool is essentially a smart query builder that,
given enough information, can build the proper query,
execute it, and display the results. It has four modes,
plus a special mode, and provides an impressive amount
of functionality from these modes.
