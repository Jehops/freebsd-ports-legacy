Cacheboy is a continuation of Squid-2 development which focuses on stability
whilst improving performance, functionality and compliance.

THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY BETA - the bugs need ironing out so please submit
any mishaps as Issues via Google Code. New functionality will only appear after
the code is stable, so please help us find and fix the bugs!

Cacheboy supports all of the features found in Squid-2. This release
currently doesn't support ICAP as it was never intergrated into the Squid-2
release.
