cgic is an ANSI C-language library for the creation of CGI-based World
Wide Web applications. For basic information about the CGI standard,
see the CGI documentation at NCSA.
   
   cgic performs the following tasks:
     * Parses form data, correcting for defective and/or inconsistent
       browsers
     * Transparently accepts both GET and POST form data
     * Handles line breaks in form fields in a consistent manner
     * Provides string, integer, floating-point, and single- and
       multiple-choice functions to retrieve form data
     * Provides bounds checking for numeric fields
     * Loads CGI environment variables into C strings which are always
       non-null
     * Provides a way to capture CGI situations for replay in a debugging
       environment
       
cgic should be compatible with any CGI-compliant server environment.
