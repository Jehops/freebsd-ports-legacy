Junkbuster-zlib is a modified version of the Internet Junkbuster Proxy v2.0.2
which can automatically compress text/html and text/plain documents for clients
which support Accept-Encoding: gzip (e.g. Netscape 4.7, Internet Explorer 5,
Lynx 2.8.3) to save downstream modem/network bandwidth. It uses the zlib
compression library to perform on-the-fly compression of HTML documents.
