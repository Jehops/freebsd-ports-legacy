This is a protocol handler for Mozilla and Firefox that forwards
some link types to a running MLdonkey (see www.mldonkey.net) or
eMule (see www.emule-project.net) client.

Supported protocols are ed2k:, magnet: and sig2dat:. For eMule,
only ed2k: is supported, of course.

Also note that eMule support is still beta and has only been
tested to work with eMule versions 0.45* and 0.46a as of yet.
Please send eMule specific questions to Dan Fritz.

The protocol handler is implemented in JavaScript and should run
on any platform supported by Mozilla or Firefox.
