RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/Zope$ /Zope/ [R]
#
# Zope requires the authentication headers to be passed to it if it is
# called through the cgi of another web server (like apache). An "easy"
# way to do so is to do a little mod_rewrite'ing. See doc/WEBSERVER.txt in
# your Zope base directory for further information.
#
# Uncomment the first RewriteRule if you move Zope.cgi into
# /usr/local/www/cgi-bin
#
# This maps maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi CGI script.
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
#RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/www/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [env=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]
