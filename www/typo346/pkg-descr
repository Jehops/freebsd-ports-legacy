TYPO3 is a free Open Source content management system for enterprise purposes
on the web and in intranets. It offers full flexibility and extendability while
featuring an accomplished set of ready-made interfaces, functions and modules.

Old stable release
Support for this version will be dropped entirely when TYPO3 6.0 is released.
Updating to TYPO3 4.5 LTS or TYPO3 4.7 is seriously recommended, depending on
how long you wish to be supported.
