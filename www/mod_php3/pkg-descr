=================

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the
NCSA server version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in the
NCSA server and includes many frequently requested new features,
and has an API which allows it to be extended to meet users' needs
more easily.

This version has PHP3 compiled in. PHP3 is a server-side, cross-platform,
HTML embedded scripting language which offers easy database integration.
SSL support (mod_ssl + OpenSSL) is available as an option.
