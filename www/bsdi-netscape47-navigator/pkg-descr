This is the BSDI BSD/OS version of the Netscape Navigator Web
browser with strong encryption.  Unlike the FreeBSD version, this
does not require a.out X libraries (because it is statically linked).
This browser is under U.S. export restrictions.  Do "make pre-fetch"
to determine whether you may download it.

If Java applets fail to display, do:
	# cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
	# /usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir
	# chmod 444 fonts.dir
then exit and restart your X server.
