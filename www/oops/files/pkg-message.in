===>  CONFIGURATION NOTE:
	To setup oops, you should check %%PREFIX%%/etc/oops/oops.cfg
	(a copy of %%PREFIX%%/etc/oops/oops.cfg.sample) as well as
	other files in %%PREFIX%%/etc/oops before running oops.

	If you use storages, do not forget to format them before
	the first use (oops -z -c %%PREFIX%%/etc/oops/oops.cfg).
===>  BE CAREFULL HOW TO BOOT on 1.5.24 and above:
	To run oops server from startup, add oops_enable="YES"
	in your /etc/rc.conf.
