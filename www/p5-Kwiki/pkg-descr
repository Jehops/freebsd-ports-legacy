Kwiki - The Kwiki Wiki Building Framework

A Wiki is a website that allows its users to add pages, and edit any
existing pages. It is one of the most popular forms of web
collaboration. If you are new to wiki, visit
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors which is possibly the oldest
wiki, and has lots of information about how wikis work.

Kwiki is a Perl wiki implementation based on the Spoon application
architecture and using the Spiffy object orientation model. The major
goals of Kwiki are that it be easy to install, maintain and extend.

All the features of a Kwiki wiki come from plugin modules. The base
installation comes with the bare minimum plugins to make a working
Kwiki. To make a really nice Kwiki installation you need to install
additional plugins. Which plugins you pick is entirely up to you.
Another goal of Kwiki is that every installation will be unique. When
there are hundreds of plugins available, this will hopefully be the
case.
