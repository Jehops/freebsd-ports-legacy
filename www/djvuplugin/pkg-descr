Over 90 percent of the information in  the world is still on paper. Many
of those paper documents include  color graphics and/or photographs that
represent  significant invested  value.  And almost  none  of that  rich
content is on the Internet.

That's because scanning such documents and  getting them onto a Web site
has  been problematic  at  best.  At the  high  resolution necessary  to
preserve the  quality of images  and to  keep type readable,  file sizes
become far too bulky for  acceptable download speed. Reducing resolution
to  achieve satisfactory  download  speed means  forfeiting quality  and
legibility. Conventional JPEG and  GIF compression techniques only begin
to solve the problem. As a result, Web site content developers have been
unable to leverage existing printed materials.

Until now...
