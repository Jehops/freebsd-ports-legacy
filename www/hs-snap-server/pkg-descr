Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can visit
the Snap project website.

The Snap HTTP server is a high performance, epoll-enabled, iteratee-based web
server library written in Haskell. Together with the "snap-core" library upon
which it depends, it provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming
interface to the HTTP protocol.

Higher-level facilities for building web applications (like user/session
management, component interfaces, data modeling, etc.) are planned but not
yet implemented, so this release will mostly be of interest for those who:

* need a fast and minimal HTTP API at roughly the same level of abstraction
  as Java servlets, or

* are interested in contributing to the Snap Framework project.
