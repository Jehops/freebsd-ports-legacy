Apache::Language objects act like language-aware hashes.  They store
key/language/values triplets.  Using the Accept-Language: field sent by
HTTP clients, they can pick the best fit language for that specific client.
Apache::Language's usage is transparent
and should prove to be quite convenient (and hopefully, efficient).
