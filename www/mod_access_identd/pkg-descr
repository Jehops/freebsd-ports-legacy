A security module for the Apache Web server, supplying
mandatory access control based upon the client username
and host. The credentials are obtained using the identd
(RFC1413) mechanism, so this is of limited usefulness
if document access is through a proxy or by clients not
running an RFC1413 server daemon. As a result, this module
is best suited for intranets.
