  Adzap has now been installed.  To get it up and running, copy
  ${PREFIX}/share/examples/adzap/adzap.conf to ${PREFIX}/etc and modify
  it to match your setup.  Then edit your squid configuration and
  add ${PREFIX}/libexec/adzap as your http-redirector.

  If you run a web server, you can copy the *.{html,js,gif} files from
  ${PREFIX}/share/examples/adzap to your htdocs tree and modify
  the web locations in ${PREFIX}/etc/adzap.conf accordingly.
