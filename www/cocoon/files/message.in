Cocoon is now installed in %%APP_HOME%%.

In order to be able to run Cocoon, please add the following line to
/etc/rc.conf:

  %%APP_NAME%%_enable="YES"

If you wish to start cocoon right now, invoke the startup script with
`%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/%%APP_NAME%%.sh start'
and point your web browser to the default home page at
http://localhost:%%PORT%%/ where you may read the documentation and test the
samples.

For this control script to run seamlessly, it is recommended to increase the
maximum length of commands displayed by ps(1).  Please append the following
setting to /etc/sysctl.conf:

  # Do not truncate command line arguments in ps(1) listing
  kern.ps_arg_cache_limit=10000

This setting will take effect at next reboot, however it is possible to have
immediate effect with the following command as root:

  # sysctl kern.ps_arg_cache_limit=10000

If you wish to skip this setting, please note that the `stop', `restart' and
`status' will not function properly with %%APP_NAME%%.sh.


Enjoy!
