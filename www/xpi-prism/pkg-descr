Prism is designed to create a better environment for running
your favorite web-based applications. Much of what we used to
accomplish using an application running locally on our computers
is moving into the web browser. Thanks to advances in web technology,
these apps are increasingly powerful and usable. As a result,
applications like Gmail, Facebook and Google Docs are soaring
in popularity.
