bk2site will transform your Netscape bookmarks file into a yahoo-like website
with slashdot-like news. Its goal is to enable the user to establish zero-
maintenance high-value (small) websites. 

* Includes hit-counter and display feature (see which URLs are popular). 
* Includes integrated cgi-bin search.pl program. 
* Nice-looking output. 
* Powerful customization. 
* Inserts navigation information into the top of each page. 
* Puts a "new" icon next to new entries. 
* Supports any other icon(s) (e.g., cool.gif, hot.gif) you might want to show. 
* Puts New Additions on the front page. 
* Puts News Items on the front page. 
* Supports URL and directory aliases. 
* Use PRIVATE keyword to keep some URLs/folders from appearing. 
* You can use it to automatically generate almost any sort of structured text
  file, such as a My.Netscape channel
* (see mynetscapebase.rdf), an email newsletter, etc. 
* It can also download (http) other people's channels (RSS files) and display
  their contents in the generated web pages.
