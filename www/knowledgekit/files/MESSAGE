KnowledgeKit

	This port has placed KnowledgeKit in your Zope import directory
	%%PREFIX%%/Zope/import/ with the following files:

	KnowledgeKit-%%VER%%.zexp
	KnowledgeKit_Example.zexp

	To add KnowledgeKit to your Zope install, go into the management
	interface, press the "Import/Export" button, and type in the
	file names above.  The first is the KnowledgeKit Product, and
	the second is a demo.  You can't add the demo as the Zope
	superuser; add it as your Zope user instead.
