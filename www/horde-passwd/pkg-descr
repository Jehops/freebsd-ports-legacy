Passwd is the Horde password changing application. While it has been
released and is in production use at many sites, it is also under
heavy development in an effort to expand and improve the module.

Right now, Passwd provides fairly complete support for changing
passwords via poppassd, ldap, unix expect scripts, the unix smbpasswd
command for smb/cifs password support, servuftp, vmailmgr, vpopmail,
and sql passwords.
