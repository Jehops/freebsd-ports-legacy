# Here are the 3 possible configuration modes.
# The apache module uses one of them to get information
# about your deployed applications.
# 1085 is the reserved port on which wotaskd processes listen to by default.

# Host List Configuration
# wotaskd is started automatically on supported platforms,
# so this is the default mode.
# The apache module gets its configuration from the wotaskds
# listed on the configuration line
# For multiple hosts:
# WebObjectsConfig http://<name-of-a-host>:<port-on-a-host>,http://<name-of-another-host>:<port-on-a-host> <interval>
# For localhost: 
WebObjectsConfig http://localhost:1085 10

# Multicast Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from all wotaskds
# that respond to the multicast call on the subnet
# WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10

# File Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from one file
# WebObjectsConfig file://<path-to-a-xml-config-file> 10

# To change the logging options, read the following comments:
# The option name is "WebObjectsLog" and the first value indicates the path
# of the log file.

# informational order:
#       "Debug",    "Info",    "Warn",    "Error",    "User"
#
# Note: To enable logging, touch '/tmp/logWebObjects' 
# as the administrative user (usually root).
#
# The following line is the default:
# WebObjectsLog /tmp/WebObjects.log Debug
