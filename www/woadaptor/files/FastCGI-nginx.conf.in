# This is a sample snippet from Nginx's config file that is needed to
# run WebObjects FastCGI adaptor
#
# You will need to use a standalone FastCGI server to run the adaptor.
# This can be done by setting woadaptor_enable="YES" in /etc/rc.conf
# and running %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/woadaptor start
#
# Note: You must ensure that the web server user has permission to use
#       the socket.
