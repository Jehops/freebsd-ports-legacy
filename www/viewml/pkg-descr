ViewML (Viewable Markup Language) is the first freely available, open source
web browser targeted specifically at the embedded platform. The web browser,
known as The ViewML Project will be developed and maintained with source code
made available to the public, as well as with contributions from the embedded
community.

As of now, the ViewML browser along with its interface requires 2.1 MB of RAM,
with a small disk image foot-print requiring only 760K.

The ViewML Project selected the KDE Desktop's kfm HTML display engine because
of its superior design and display capabilities. The HTML engine was extracted,
then ported, using a thin glue layer, to the small but fast FLTK (Fast Light
Tool Kit, www.fltk.org) applications framework to keep the RAM usage extremely
small, but still allows to fully implement all of the necessary user interface
controls.
