Post-install Notes for p5-Apache
================================

This port has built a new Apache dynamic shared object (DSO).
If it was built from source, the module has already been
activated in ${PREFIX}/etc/apache/apache.conf.  If, however,
it was installed using the binary package, the activation must be
done manually, using the command
	${PREFIX}/sbin/apxs -e -a -n perl libperl.so

This is actually a bug.  (If you are using conditional module loading
in apache.conf, such as with mod_ssl, apxs may add the module in the
wrong place.)

($PREFIX is usually /usr/local unless you override it).
