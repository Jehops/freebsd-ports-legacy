Post-install Notes for p5-Apache
================================

This port has built a new httpd binary that includes the perl5 module
(mod_perl).  To avoid overwriting an existing httpd binary, it has been
installed as

${PREFIX}/sbin/httpd_modperl

($PREFIX is usually /usr/local unless you override it).

In order to use this module, you should rename it to httpd.  Remember that
this binary is the standard apache port, with mod_perl and nothing else
added.  If you have already built yourself an httpd binary containing
optional modules, you are better off building mod_perl yourself.

The original source for p5-Apache can be found at any CPAN mirror, in the
directory
