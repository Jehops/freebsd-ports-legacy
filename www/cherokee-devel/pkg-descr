Cherokee is a very fast, flexible, and lightweight Web server. It is
implemented entirely in C, and has no dependencies beyond a standard C
library. It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly
configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL),
virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error
management, and much more.
