WebGlimpse adds search capabilities to your WWW site automatically and
easily. It attaches a small search box to the bottom of every HTML page,
and allows the search to cover the neighborhood of that page or the whole
site. With WebGlimpse there is no need to construct separate search pages,
and no need to interrupt the users from their browsings. All pages remain
unchanged except for the extra search capabilities. It is even possible
for the search to efficiently cover remote pages linked from your pages.
(WebGlimpse will collect such remote pages to your disk and index them.)
Installation, customization (e.g., deciding which pages to collect and
which ones to index), and maintenance are easy.
