Congratulations!

You have just installed the scoop distribution into $PREFIX/www/scoop. It has
not yet been configured to actually run.

Before going any further, you should:

  1. Move the scoop directory into your desired web-accessible location (e.g.
     /usr/local/www/data/).
  2. Read the INSTALL file in the scoop directory.
  3. Then, run scoop/scripts/install.pl to set up the database and
     configuration files.
     
  >>> IMPORTANT: when the install script asks to install CPAN
  >>> libraries, you can skip this step: the port has installed all the perl
  >>> libraries scoop needs.

  4. Finally, follow the instructions on how to configure
     your apache server, including modifying your httpd.conf file.
  5. Restart apache.

Then, enjoy Scoop!
