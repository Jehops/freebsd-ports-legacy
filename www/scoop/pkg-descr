Scoop is a "collaborative media application". It falls somewhere between a
content management system, a web bulletin board system, and a weblog. Scoop is
designed to enable your website to become a community. It empowers your
visitors to be the producers of the site, contributing news and discussion, and
making sure that the signal remains high.

A scoop site can be run almost entirely by the readers. The whole life-cycle of
content is reader-driven. They submit news, they choose what to post, and they
can discuss what they post. Readers can rate other readers comments, as well,
providing a collaborative filtering tool to let the best contributions float to
the top. Based on this rating, you can also reward consistently good
contributors with greater power to review potentially untrusted content. The
real power of Scoop is that it is almost totally collaborative.
