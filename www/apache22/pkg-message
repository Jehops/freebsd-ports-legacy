To run apache www server from startup, add apache22_enable="YES"
in your /etc/rc.conf. Extra options can be found in startup script.

Your hostname must be resolvable using at least 1 mechanism in
/etc/nsswitch.conf typically DNS or /etc/hosts or apache might
have issues starting depending on the modules you are using.

  The default version was changed from www/apache22 to www/apache24,
  pre-build apache modules will also reflect this!

  In case ports are build by yourself and apache22 is required
  use the following command to keep apache22 as default

  echo "DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=apache=2.2" >> /etc/make.conf
