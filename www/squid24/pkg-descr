This is the Squid Internet Object Cache developed by the National
Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR) and Internet
volunteers.  This software is freely available for anyone to use.

This software is based on the Harvest Object Cache developed by
the University of Colorado and the University of Southern California.
The Harvest home page is http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/.

ARPA funding for the Harvest project has ended, the squid project has
continued development of the cache where Harvest finished.

* This version of squid is no longer officially supported. *

Please see this port's Makefile for a list of compilation options.

*** UPDATE NOTICE ***
Starting with Version 2.4.7_11 the default user:group changed from
nobody:nogroup to squid:squid. You can restore the old behavior
of this port by specifying SQUID_UID=nobody SQUID_GID=nogroup in
your make environment. Helper applications are now installed to
$PREFIX/libexec/squid instead of $PREFIX/libexec, too.

You can find further information on the project's website at
WWW: http://www.squid-cache.org/
