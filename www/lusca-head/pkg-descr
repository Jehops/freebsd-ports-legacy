Lusca is a continuation of Squid-2 development which focuses on stability
whilst improving performance, functionality and compliance.

Lusca supports all of the features found in Squid-2. This release
currently doesn't support ICAP as it was never intergrated into the Squid-2
release.

Lusca is a drop-in compatible replacement for the Squid-2 and Cacheboy packages.
The "squid" configuration parameters, directories and rc script setup is
mirrored from the Squid packages to facilitate this.
