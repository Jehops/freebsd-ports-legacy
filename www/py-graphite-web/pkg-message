In /usr/local/etc/graphite/ copy the graphite.wsgi.example to graphite.wsgi

To run graphite, you will need to setup Apache by creating a vhost similar to
the following:

WSGIImportScript /usr/local/etc/graphite/graphite.wsgi process-group=graphite application-group=%{GLOBAL}
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName graphite
	DocumentRoot "/usr/local/graphite/webapp"

	# I've found that an equal number of processes & threads tends
	# to show the best performance for Graphite (ymmv).
	WSGIDaemonProcess graphite processes=5 threads=5 display-name='%{GROUP}' inactivity-timeout=120
	WSGIProcessGroup graphite
	WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}

	# XXX You will need to create this file! There is a graphite.wsgi.example
	# file in this directory that you can safely use, just copy it to graphite.wgsi
	WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/etc/graphite/graphite.wsgi

	Alias /content/ /usr/local/graphite/webapp/content/
	<Location "/content/">
		SetHandler None
	</Location>

	# XXX In order for the django admin site media to work you
	# must change @DJANGO_ROOT@ to be the path to your django
	# installation, which is probably something like:
	# /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django
	#Alias /media/ "@DJANGO_ROOT@/contrib/admin/media/"
	Alias /media/ ${${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}}/django
	<Location "/media/">
		SetHandler None
	</Location>

	# The graphite.wsgi file has to be accessible by apache. It won't
	# be visible to clients because of the DocumentRoot though.
	<Directory /usr/local/etc/graphite/>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>


Then initialize the sqllite user database and create the admin user:

	python ${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}/graphite/manage.py syncdb

Change the ownership of the user database so the webapp can write to it:

	chown ${WWWOWN} ${PREFIX}/graphite/storage/graphite.db

Now you should be able to access the graphite virtual host you created in the
first step.
