This module is intended to help you automate interaction with a website.
It bears a not-very-remarkable outwards resemblance to WWW::Chat, on
which it is based.  The main difference between this module and
WWW::Chat is that WWW::Chat requires a pre-processing stage before you
can run your script, whereas WWW::Automate does not.

WWW::Automate is a subclass of LWP::UserAgent, so anything you can do
with an LWP::UserAgent, you can also do with this.  See LWP::UserAgent
for more information on the possibilities.
