-----------------------------------------------------------------
You have installed cgiwrap, a wrapper to securely execute user
CGI programs.  cgiwrap is reported to work with most Web servers
that support CGI, so no one specific server has been included as
a dependancy.  If you are unsure of which Web server to use, it
is recommended that you try the Apache HTTP server.

The cgiwrap binaries have been installed in the following
directory:

  %%MAIN_CGIDIR%%

You should create/manage the following two files, otherwise
cgiwrap will not function as expected.  These ACL files define
which users can and cannot run CGI binaries via cgiwrap:

  %%ALLOWFILE%%
  %%DENYFILE%%
