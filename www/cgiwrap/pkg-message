-----------------------------------------------------------------
You have installed cgiwrap, a wrapper to securely execute user
CGI programs.  cgiwrap is reported to work with most web servers
that support CGI, so no one specific server has been included as
a depend.  If you are unsure of which webserver to use, it is
recommended to try the Apache web server package.

The cgiwrap scripts have been installed in:
    %%PREFIX%%/www/cgi-bin
...the default location for Apache's cgi-bin directory.

If cgiwrap's allow/deny control is enabled, you must create either
%%PREFIX%%/etc/cgiwrap.allow and/or %%PREFIX%%/etc/cgiwrap.deny
before cgiwrap will function.
