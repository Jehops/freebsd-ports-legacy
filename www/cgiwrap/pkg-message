-----------------------------------------------------------------
You have installed cgiwrap, a wrapper to securely execute user
CGI programs.  cgiwrap is reported to work with most web servers
that support CGI, so no one specific server has been included as
a depend.  If you are unsure of which webserver to use, it is
recommended to try the Apache web server package.

The cgiwrap scripts have been installed in:
    ${PREFIX}/www/cgi-bin
...the default location for Apache's cgi-bin directory.

The cgiwrapd and nph-cgiwrapd scripts are disabled by default, as they
may give away sensitive information about the CGI environment.  To
enable them, you must chmod 4755 ${PREFIX}/www/cgi-bin/cgiwrapd

Access control enabled, you must create either
${PREFIX}/etc/cgiwrap.allow or ${PREFIX}/etc/cgiwrap.deny before
cgiwrap will function.
