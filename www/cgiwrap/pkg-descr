This is CGIWrap - a gateway that allows more secure user access to
CGI programs on an HTTPd server than is provided by the http server
itself. The primary function of CGIWrap is to make certain that
any CGI script runs with the permissions of the user who installed
it, and not those of the server.

CGIWrap works with NCSA httpd, Apache, CERN httpd, NetSite Commerce
and Communications servers, and probably any other Unix based web
server software that supports CGI.

CGIWrap was written by Nathan Neulinger <nneul@umr.edu>.  More
