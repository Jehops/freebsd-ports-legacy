The Google API Client for Python is a client library for accessing
the Buzz, Latitude, Moderator, Diacritize, Translate, Custom Search,
Search API for Shopping, URL Shortener, and Prediction APIs.

If you wish to use a Google API that is not in that list then you should
look at the Google Data APIs Python Client Library (devel/py-gdata).
