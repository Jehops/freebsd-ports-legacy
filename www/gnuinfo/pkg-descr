This is a cgi program that allows you to read the GNU .info files
installed on a machine with any web browser.  Needs a running web
server (like apache, in /usr/ports/www).  The quality of the html
isn't as good as that generated by the texi2html converter (in
/usr/ports/textproc) but the advantage of this one is that it
doesn't need access to the .texinfo files which are usually only
available in the original source archives of the installed programs
and not installed by default.

The port actually installs three cgis:  gnuinfo, with the search
path preset to /usr/share/info:/usr/local/info:/usr/X11R6/info,
and gnuinfo.local as well as gnuinfo.X11R6, with just /usr/local/info
and /usr/X11R6/info, respectively.  Use these to get at the toplevel
`dir' files for the other dirs, and to get at info pages for which
there are different versions with the same name in the different
directories, like the two gcc.info* you have when you installed
gcc 2.95.1 (/usr/ports/lang/egcs) in addition to the (less recent)
system compiler.
