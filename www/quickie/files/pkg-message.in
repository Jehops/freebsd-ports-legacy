Quickie has been installed. Quickie's files are stored in
standard system locations, rather than all under the web
root. In order for Quickie to be accessible, a copy - or
symlink if your web server supports it - of the CGI binary
must be made to the cgi-bin directory of your web server:

    cp -p %%PREFIX%%/bin/quickie /path/to/cgi-bin

This file should be owned by www:www, and be executable.

If this directory was found, the copy will have been made
for you, and will be removed when the port is deinstalled
or upgraded.
