Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with
simple variable interpolation.  Shakespeare templates can be used inline
with a quasi-quoter or in an external file.  Shakespeare interpolates
variables according to the type being inserted.  In this case, the
variable type needs a ToText instance.
