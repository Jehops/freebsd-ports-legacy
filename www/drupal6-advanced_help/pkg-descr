The advanced help module allows module developers to store their
help outside the module system, in pure .html files. The files can
be easily translated simply by copying them into the right translations
directory. The entire system can appear in a popup or not as the
module prefers (and by taking away access to view the popups, a
site can force the popups to not exist).

The system ties into Drupal's search system and is fully indexed,
so the entire contents can be searched for keywords. the help files
can be placed in a hierarchy as well, allowing for top down navigation
of the help.
