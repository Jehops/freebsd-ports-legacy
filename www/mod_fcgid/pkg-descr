mod_fcgid -- an alternative FastCGI module for Apache2

mod_fcgid has a new process management strategy, which concentrates on
reducing the number of fastcgi server, and kick out the corrupt
fastcgi server as soon as possible.

mod_fcgid is binary-compatible with mod_fastcgi so your existing fastcgi
programs do not need to be recompiled.  mod_fcgid supports suEXEC.
