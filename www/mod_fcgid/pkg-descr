mod_fcgid -- an alternative FastCGI module for Apache2

mod_fcgid has a new process management strategy, which concentrates on
reducing the number of fastcgi server, and kick out the corrupt
fastcgi server as soon as possible.

The bad news is that it does not currently support suEXEC, and the
good news is that it has PHP support.  Check out the web site for
details.
