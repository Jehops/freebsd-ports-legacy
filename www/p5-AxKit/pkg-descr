Apache AxKit is an XML Application Server for Apache. It provides on-the-fly
conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using either W3C
standard techniques, or flexible custom code. AxKit also uses a built-in Perl
interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful techniques for XML
transformation.
