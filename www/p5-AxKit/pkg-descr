AxKit --- XML Delivery Toolkit for Apache

AxKit allows serving XML pages through Apache and mod_perl.  It uses
XSLT stylesheets to transform pages before sending them to the browser.
It also allows Perl stylesheets for extra flexibility.

AxKit has good caching of results, and can be up to 80% of the speed of
Apache when serving from it's cache.
