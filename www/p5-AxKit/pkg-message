Please consult ``man AxKit'' for instructions on installing AxKit into
your Apache configuration.

AxKit may not function properly unless Apache is compiled WITHOUT
expat support.  To compile Apache define:

	WITHOUT_APACHE_EXPAT=yes

To determine if your existing Apache installation supports expat:

	strings `which httpd` | grep XML

If this produces any output, see above.  See the FAQ on
http://axkit.org for full details.
