Please consult ``man AxKit'' for instructions on installing AxKit into
your Apache configuration.

NB: This version of AxKit is only compiled with the ability to use XSLT
stylesheets.  If you wish to use XPathScript or XSP, you must also
install the p5-XML-Sablotron port/package.  However, you must also
recompile your Apache binary to *not* include a builtin version of
expat.  To see if you need to do this, type in:

	strings `which httpd` | grep XML

If this produces any output, you must recompile apache passing the
--disable-rule=EXPAT argument to the configure program.  See the FAQ on
http://axkit.org for full details.
