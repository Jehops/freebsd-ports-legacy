The Electronic Logbook (ELOG) provides a Web interface to manage notes. 
Its general purpose is to make it easy for people to put and access 
information online; in the form of short, time stamped text messages 
with optional HTML markup for presentation, and optional file 
attachments. Its features include:
  * Has its own daemon, no need for a full-fledged server (e.g. Apache).
  * Being a Web application, search, browse and edit notes from 
    anywhere.
  * Includes a tool to create and access notes from the command 
    line.
  * Stores notes as simple as plain text; no special formatting.
  * Uses customizable mail-like headers (RFC 2822) to categorize 
     the notes.
  * Supports RSS feeds for entries.
  * Exports to CSV (comma-separated-values).
  * File attachments (e.g. images, archives).
  * Supports workgroups, shared logbooks.
  * Message threads, mail notifications for a 
    forum-like usage.
  * Hosts one or more logbooks stored in separate 
    sections on the host.
  * Remotely clone logbooks on separate servers.
