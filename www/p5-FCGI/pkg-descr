FCGI is a Fast CGI module for Perl. It's based on the FCGI module that comes
with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit.

FCGI.pm isn't Unicode aware, only characters within the range 0x00-0xFF are
supported. Attempts to output strings containing characters above 0xFF results
in a exception: (F) Wide character in %s.

Users who wants the previous (FCGI.pm <= 0.68) incorrect behavior can disable
the exception by using the bytes pragma.
