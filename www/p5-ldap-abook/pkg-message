========== Installing ldap-abook for the first time ==========
Tell the openldap server about the abook schema with the
following line in $PREFIX/etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

include $PREFIX/www/ldap-abook/examples/default/abookperson.schema

Create the initial ``abook'' ou using the following command:

    cd $PREFIX/www/ldap-abook/examples/default
    ldapadd -h host -W -D 'dc=your_domain' -f abook.ldif

replacing host and your_domain as appropriate (abook.ldif must
have "your_domain" changed too).

Modify "your_domain" and "secret" (and possibly "Manager") in
$PREFIX/etc/AddressBook.conf too.

Link to abook.cgi from your web server's CGI directory:

    cd /usr/local/www/cgi-bin
    ln -s $PREFIX/www/ldap-abook/cgi-bin/abook.cgi
