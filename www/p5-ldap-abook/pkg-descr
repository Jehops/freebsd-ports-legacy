ldap-abook provides a web interface for adding, removing and modifying
LDAP addressbook records.  These addressbook records can be used with
mail clients such as Sylpheed, Microsoft Outlook and probably Netscape
and Mozilla.

Attributes such as address details, date of birth and phonelist membership
are also possible, allowing other applications to feed off the same
database.
