.Nm orionctl
.Nd Orion server control interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar start | Ar stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
shell script provides an interface to the Orion application server.
.Pp
This script has 2 modes of operation, One is
.Em shell script mode
and the other is
.Em rc script mode .
If run as
.Nm
shell script mode is used, otherwise rc script mode is used. Shell script mode
assumes that the script is used as a normal shell script, while rc script mode
assumes the script is used to start or stop Orion at boot time.
.Pp
The script expects exactly one argument, either
.Ar start
or
.Ar stop .
If more than one argument is given, then all arguments but the first are
ignored.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar start
Start Orion, if it is not already running. The ID of the started process will
be saved in a PID file.
.It Ar stop
Stop Orion, if it is actually running. The process with the ID stored in
the PID file will be killed.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
The following error conditions are detected. They will be checked in the
specified order. In every case where an error message is printed it will be
prepended by the name of the script
.Em ( basename $0 ) .
.Pp
If no argument is passed, or if an argument other than
.Ar start
or
.Ar stop
is passed as the first argument, then a simple help message is printed and the
script is exited with error code 64.
.Pp
In 
.Em rc script mode
a newline will be printed before any error message.

.Ar start
the following errors conditions can be triggered:

.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Pa /var/run/orion.pid
The Orion PID file that is used to store the process ID of the currently
running Orion process in. It is deleted as soon as Orion is stopped and
recreated when Orion is started. It should never be writable for anyone but
.Em root ,
.It Pa %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/orion.sh
