************************************************************
You've installed mod_watch, a module to monitor bandwidth
usage.

/var/spool/mod_watch has been created. It's owned by user 
nobody and group nobody. For mod_watch to work, the Apache
user/group must be able to create and update files in this
directory.

Edit your apache.conf or httpd.conf to enable and setup this
module. Have a look at the files in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_watch/html for information on how to
configure it etc.

Then do this to make it work effective:

# apachectl configtest (see if there are any config errors)
# apachectl restart
