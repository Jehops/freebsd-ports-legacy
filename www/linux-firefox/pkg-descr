Firefox is a Web, FTP and gopher browser branched from Mozilla.  It does not
include an HTML editor, e-mail user agent, IRC client, or news reader.

This is a pre-compiled Linux/i386 version, able to run plugins from that
platform.  This port is compatible with the Flash plugin from
ports/www/linux-flashplugin6/ and with the Java plugin from
ports/java/linux-blackdown-jdk14/.
