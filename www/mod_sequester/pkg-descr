The mod_sequester module is similar to mod_access, controlling whether
remote clients can access your Apache Web site's resources based upon
information not subject to the user's control.  Rather than using
network connexion information to make the access determination,
however, mod_sequester uses the date and time of the request.  If
the request is made during an interval when mod_sequester's
settings indicate the resource is accessible, the document will be
processed normally -- otherwise a '403 Forbidden' will be returned.
Obviously, the settings and the check use the server's date and time
value, not the client's.
