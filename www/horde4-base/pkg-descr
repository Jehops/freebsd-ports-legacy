Horde is both a piece of software and a project.

The Horde Project comprises a set of Web-based productivity, messaging,
and project-management applications.

The Horde Framework is a common code-base used by Horde applications,
including libraries and a common user interface. Horde and its components
are written in PHP <URL:http://www.php.net/>.

Horde alone won't do you much good, though; the real functionality is
in Horde's components, and mostly IMP, the well-known webmail (see the
port mail/imp).
