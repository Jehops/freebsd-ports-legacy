BookmarkDD is a useful extension that helps you manage your bookmarks.
It notices when a duplicate bookmark is added, specifies where the
previous URL is and gives you a chance to change the parent folder of
duplicate bookmark. There is also a window to manage all duplicate
bookmarks already in your bookmarks.
