CGI Lite v1.62 - Perl 5.0 module to process and decode WWW form information.

       The module can be used to handle and decode WWW form
       information. Both GET and POST requests can be processed.
       In the case of POST requests, the information can be one
       of two possible MIME types:

           application/x-www-form-urlencoded
           multipart/form-data

       This module is very light-weight, and can be thought of as
       an enhanced version of the old cgi-lib.pl library for Perl
       4.0 by Steven Brenner (S.E.Brenner@bioc.cam.ac.uk).
