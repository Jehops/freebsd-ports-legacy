Moxplugger is a multimedia plugin for Unix Netscape 3.0 or later that
handles Quicktime, MPEG, MP2, AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim,
MIDI, Soundtracker, AU, WAV and Commodore 64 audio files.  MPEG audio and
video can be streamed.

There is also support for viewing word documents and spreadsheets inline
currently.

Mozplugger is a very small plugin, because plugger uses external programs
to show/play the different formats.

This is based on Plugger 4.0 as released on Feburary 2003.
