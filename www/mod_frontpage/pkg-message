1.)

Check your httpd.conf, if you have included a ResourceConfig and
AccessConfig. If you do not have these files, you'll have to add
these lines to make frontpage extensions working properly. These
lines are commented out in a default config, so you'll have to
activate them again. If you have some real ResourceConfig and
AccessConfig, you can skip this part.

ResourceConfig /dev/null
AccessConfig /dev/null


2.)

You'll also need to change AllowOverride under
<Directory "%%PREFIX%%/www/data"> ( or the place where you
moved your webservers ) from None to at least:

AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit Indexes Options

Don't use "AllowOverride All" if you have a server environment
with customers, since this can be a security risk If you use
this, they can enable mod_php4 etc. themself with .htaccess files.


3.)

You can turn off/on the extensions and the frontpage administration
per site in httpd.conf and per virtual server. FrontPageAdminDisable
is the default if no option is given.

FrontPageEnable         # Enable FP Extensions Client publish
FrontPageDisable        # Disable FP Extensions Client publish
FrontPageAdminEnable    # Enable FP Extensions Admin web site
FrontPageAdminDisable   # Disable FP Extensions Admin web site

If no key word options are present in the httpd.conf file the default of
FrontPageDisable and FrontPageAdminDisable is used resulting in a working
Apache environment where the complete frontpage environment is disabled.


4.)

After you have made these changes, you'll have to execute:

%%PREFIX%%/frontpage/version5.0/fp_install.sh to build the base
apache/frontpage web site and to setup frontpage users and admins.
You can also run this to add virtual hosts to the apache/frontpage
system.


5.)

If you have installed the port in another PREFIX than "/usr/local"
you have to create a symlink. Microsoft has hardcoded the local
path in their binarys. If you do not use fp_install.sh, you have
to create the link manually:

ln -s %%PREFIX%%/frontpage /usr/local/frontpage
