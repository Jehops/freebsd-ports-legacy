Check your httpd.conf, if you have included a ResourceConfig and
AccessConfig. If you do not have these files, you'll have to add
these lines to make frontpage extensions working properly:

ResourceConfig /dev/null
AccessConfig /dev/null


You'll also need to change AllowOverride under
<Directory "/usr/local/www/data"> ( or the place where you
moved your webservers ) from None to at least:

AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit Indexes Options


You can turn off/on the extensions and the frontpage administration
per site in httpd.conf and per virtual server. FrontPageAdminDisable
is the default if no option is given.

FrontPageEnable		# Enable Frontpage Extensions
FrontPageDisable	# Disable Frontpage Extensions
FrontPageAdminEnable	# Enable Frontpage Extensions fpadmcgi.exe
FrontPageAdminDisable	# Disable Frontpage Extensions fpadmcgi.exe


After you have made these changes, you'll have to execute:

/usr/local/frontpage/version5.0/fp_install.sh
