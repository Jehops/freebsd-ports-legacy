************************************************************************

The BSDI FrontPage Extentions require that libcrypt.* be linked to the
libdescrypt.* libraries.  The fpsrvadm.exe program can only create DES
passwords, but the Apache server is unable to use them when libcrypt.*
are linked to the libscrypt.* libraries.

A new apache.sh.sample has been installed. Please replace your own
apache.sh with this script. The frontpage suid key generation is
needed by mod_frontpage. Without it it doesn't work.
