This module allows you to kill off Apache httpd processes if they grow
too large. You can make the decision to kill a process based on its
overall size, by setting a minimum limit on shared memory, or a maximum
on unshared memory.

You can set limits for each of these sizes, and if any limit is exceeded,
the process will be killed.

You can also limit the frequency that these sizes are checked so that
this module only checks every N requests.
