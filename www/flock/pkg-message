======================================================================
As of version 0.4_7, this port appears to be stable *again*. It will work
with either of the port versions of perl, provided you do "use.perl port".
It will NOT work with the -STABLE base-system versions of Perl.

If you use the lang/perl5.8 port, please remove the File::Spec package with
the command "pkg_deinstall -f p5-File-Spec". If you are updating to the 5.8
version of perl, please do this *first*.

Any bug reports should be addressed to the maintainers at:
	phoenix@freebsd.org
You may also Cc: freebsd-ports@freebsd.org. Please do not send
bug reports to any other addresses. 

Please include the following information with any bug report:
* Output from 'uname -a'.
* Date/time stamp from www/phoenix/Makefile.
* Perl version used (/usr/bin/perl --version or 
	/usr/local/bin/perl --version for -current).
* Where/when did the problem occur: configuring, building, or
	running phoenix?
* How can you reproduce the problem?

Thank you for your help in testing and reporting bugs, and we hope you
enjoy using Phoenix.
The Maintainers (alane@ & trevor@)

Additional notes:

0.4_8:
Add patch to fix network ops on -CURRENT.

0.4_9:
Install link to java plugin.
Build plist after install using find/sed.

0.4_10:
Backdown after failed 0.5 from nonofficial tree. Makefile modifications
to generate plist done right this time.

0.5_1
Official 0.5 release port.

****WARNING! DANGER, WILL ROBINSON!**** You must delete your old .phoenix
dir! Save your bookmarks.html somewhere and then let it create a new
directory. You can import your old bookmark file. Bug reports from people
who did not do this are going to be taken at extremely low priority.

Also, please see the nifty new phoenix themes and extensions at the new
website http://texturizer.net/phoenix/index.html.

Finally make portlint STFU about the Makefile.

The distfile is on my distfiles dir this time, so I have mirrored it on my
html page until the distfiles dir gets mirrored in 24-48 hours.

I had to disable Xinerama since it was breaking the build.

0.5_4
Patch to hopefully fix crash when formatting time string at end of download.
Thanks to Greg Rumple and Joe Marcus Clarke for the fantastic work debugging
this one.

Added /usr/X11R6/bin/phoenix.rb. If you have ruby installed, you can run
this instead of 'phoenix' and it takes care of the 'profile in use' errors
by automatically using an existing phoenix if one is running. I didn't put
a dependency because I don't want to require ruby + ruby-shim to run the
browser.
