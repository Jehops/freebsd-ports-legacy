0.4_9:
Install link to java plugin.
Build plist after install using find/sed.

0.4_8:
Add patch to fix network ops on -CURRENT.

As of version 0.4_7, this port appears to be stable *again*. It will work
with either of the port versions of perl, provided you do "use.perl port".
It will NOT work with the -STABLE base-system versions of Perl.

If you use the lang/perl5.8 port, please remove the File::Spec package with
the command "pkg_deinstall -f p5-File-Spec". If you are updating to the 5.8
version of perl, please do this *first*.
