This is the Beonex Communicator suite (Web browser, HTML editor, e-mail user
agent, news reader, address book, and spell-checker) pre-compiled for
Linux/i386.  It is based on Mozilla, but with extra emphasis on security and
privacy.  The Linux version is necessary for running plugins which are only
available as Linux binaries.

Because of a security bug, the Chatzilla IRC client is not included in this
port.

The www/linuxflashplugin port and the Flash plugin from the www/linux-netscape6
port are compatible with this.  Java does not work.  Your mileage may vary.
