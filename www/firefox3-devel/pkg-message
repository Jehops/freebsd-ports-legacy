======================================================================
As of version 0.4_4, this port appears to be stable. It will work with
either of the port versions of perl, provided you do "use.perl port".
It may work with the base system version of perl; I (AlanE) have not
tested this.

NOTE: if you use the lang/perl5.8 port, please remove the File::Spec
package with the command "pkg_deinstall -f p5-File-Spec". If you are
updating to the 5.8 version of perl, please do this *first*.

Any bug reports should be addressed to the maintainers at:
	phoenix@geeksrus.net
You may also Cc: freebsd-ports@freebsd.org. Please do not send
bug reports to any other addresses. 

Please include the following information with any bug report:

1. Date/time stamp from www/phoenix/Makefile.
2. Perl version used (/usr/bin/perl --version).
3. If a port, did you do "use.perl port"? If no, why didn't you
   follow the instructions provided?
4. If perl 5.8, did you remove the p5-File-Spec port? If no, why
   didn't you follow the instructions provided?
5. Where/when did the problem occur: configuring, building, or
   running phoenix?
6. Can you reproduce the problem? If so, how? If not, why do you
   think we can fix it?
7. If you just have a philosophical difference of opinion with how
   this port is set up, without any factual basis, why are you
   bothering us with it? I (AlanE) have other PRs to attend to, and
   Trevor has work to do as well.

Thank you for your help in testing and report bugs, and we hope you
enjoy using Phoenix.
