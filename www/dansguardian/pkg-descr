DansGuardian is a web content filtering proxy for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
and Solaris. It relies on a proxy server, such as Squid, for all fetching;
however, DansGuardian should work with any proxy server.

It filters using multiple methods, including:
  - URL and domain filtering
  - content phrase filtering
  - PICS filtering
  - MIME filtering
  - file extension filtering
  - POST filtering
  - user and source IP filtering

This version also includes support for filter groups (simple ACLs),
pre-emptive blocking, improved URL caches,  and fork pooling for
improved performance under heavy load.
