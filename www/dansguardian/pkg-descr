DansGuardian is a web content filtering proxy for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
and Solaris. It relies on a proxy server for all fetching of pages.  It has
been most extensively tested with Squid; however, DansGuardian should work
with any proxy server.

It filters using multiple methods, including:
  - URL and domain filtering            - content phrase filtering
  - PICS filtering                      - MIME filtering
  - file extension filtering            - POST filtering
  - username and source IP filtering    - virus filtering

This version also includes support for filter groups (simple ACLs),
pre-emptive blocking, improved URL caches, and fork pooling for
improved performance under heavy load.

This is the development version of DansGuardian and is still
considered to be Beta quality.
