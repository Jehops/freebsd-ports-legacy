Kupu is now installed for Zope. It should integrate itself automatically
with Silva, CMF, and Plone if it detects them the next time you re-start
your Zope server.

While kupu is theoretically usable with other projects/servers the present
port was made primarily to support Zope/Silva. If anyone needs the port
to have more general support... start reading the Porter's Handbook! (-:
