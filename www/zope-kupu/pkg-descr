Kupu is a 'document-centric' open source client-side editor for Mozilla,
Netscape and Internet Explorer. Inspired by Maik Jablonski's Epoz editor
to improve the JavaScript code and architecture, pluggability, standards
support, support for other webservers than Zope (which was the original target
platform for Epoz), configurability and a lot of other issues.
