This is the core code base for the Calendar and Contacts Server,
which is a CalDAV, CardDAV, WebDAV, and HTTP server.

For general information about the server, see:
	http://www.calendarserver.org/
plus online DOCs, including RFCs (if installed).

Getting Started
---------------

Before you can run the server, you need to set up a configuration file
(etc/caldavd/caldavd.plist).
If you installed the examples configuration, you could start with a test
configuration by copying and editing from
%%PREFIX%%/share/examples/calendarserver/ to %%PREFIX%%/etc/caldavd/
the files
caldavd*.plist
auth/accounts.dtd
auth/accounts.xml
auth/augments.dtd
auth/augments-test.xml
auth/proxies.dtd
auth/proxies-test.xml

You will need to choose a "directory service" to use to populate your server's
principals (users, groups and resources). A directory service provides
the Calendar and Contacts Server with information about these principals.

Some of the directory services which are supported by the Calendar and
Contacts Server include:

- XMLDirectoryService: this service is configurable via an XML file that
contains principal information. The file auth/accounts.xml provides
an example principals configuration.

- OpenDirectoryService: this service uses Apple's OpenDirectory client (which in
turn uses LDAP, Active Directory, etc.) to obtain principal information.
The above configuration uses XMLDirectoryService by default.
This is a generally useful configuration for development and testing.

This file contains a user principal, named admin, with password admin,
which is set up (in caldavd-test.plist) to have administrative permissions
on the server.

Updates from earlier versions may require a DB schema update, which is done
automatically on server start up, if <key>FailIfUpgradeNeeded</key> is set to
<true/>.
