This is the official Flash Player from Macromedia. This plugin enables
you to see .swf and .spl files on the 'net from your Mozilla and
Netscape 6+ session.

Version 6 of the Macromedia Flash Player no longer works with Netscape
4.x or earlier.  For Flash support in those browsers install the
linux-flashplugin port.

Please see the Macromedia home page for more information.
