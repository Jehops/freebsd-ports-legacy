EVG addresses the needs of people who want to put photo galleries on their web
pages. Most photo galleries on the Web are rather rude - EVG automatically
generates nice index pages and hyperlinked per-image-pages. Thumbnails are
generated automatically, as well as adding or removing images is easy.
