mod_filter allows you to filter output from other modules inside
of Apache. This allows you to implement filters (think Swedish Chef,
jive, etc.). You can also use it to retailer output for your locale.
This works with HTML documents, mod_perl, PHP, JServ, CGIs, and for
that matter just about any sort of custom handler you might have.
