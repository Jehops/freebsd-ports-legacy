Harvest is a system to collect information and make it searchable
using a Web interface. It can collect information using HTTP, FTP,
NNTP, and local files. Supported formats include HTML, DVI, PS,
fulltext, mail, man pages, news, troff, WordPerfect, C sources, and
many more. Adding support for new formats is easy due to Harvest's
modular design.
