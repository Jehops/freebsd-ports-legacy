Harvest is an integrated set of tools to gather, extract, organize, search,
cache, and replicate relevant information across the Internet.  With modest
effort users can tailor Harvest to digest information in many different
formats, and offer custom search services on the Internet.  Moreover, Harvest
makes very efficient use of network traffic, remote servers, and disk space.

You can learn more about and experiment with Harvest starting with the 
Harvest Home Page at:

Source code fixes will occasionally be made available in the Fixes/
directory.  Binary distributions will be rebuilt approximately every one
to two months.  We urge you to compile the source code if you want to
incorporate fixes immediately.

The Harvest documentation is on-line, and is available via the Home Page.
