Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with
simple variable interpolation. Shakespeare templates can be used inline
with a quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates
variables according to the type being inserted. In this case, the
variable type needs a ToCss instance. This package contains 2 css
template languages. The Cassius language uses whitespace to avoid the
need for closing brackets and semi-colons. Lucius does not care about
whitespace and is a strict superset of css. There are also some
significant conveniences added for css.
