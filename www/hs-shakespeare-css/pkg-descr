Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with
simple variable interpolation.  Shakespeare templates can be used inline
with a quasi-quoter or in an external file.  Shakespeare interpolates
variables according to the type being inserted.  In this case, the
variable type needs a ToCss instance.

This package contains 2 CSS template languages.  The Cassius language
uses whitespace to avoid the need for closing brackets and semi-colons.
Lucius does not care about whitespace and is a strict superset of CSS.
There are also some significant conveniences added for CSS.
