Phoenix is a Web, FTP and gopher browser branched from Mozilla.  It does not
include an HTML editor, e-mail user agent, IRC client, or news reader.

This is a pre-compiled Linux/i386 version, able to run plugins from that
platform.  This port is compatible with the Flash plugins from the
www/linux-flashplugin and www/netscape7 ports.
