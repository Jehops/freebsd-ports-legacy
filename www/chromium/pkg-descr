Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer,
faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web. The
official site at http://www.chromium.org/Home contains design documents,
architecture overviews, testing information, and more to help you learn
to build and work with the Chromium source code.

You can help support this port of Chromium to FreeBSD by subscribing at
http://chromium.hybridsource.org.  This port was derived from older work
extracted from the weekly subscriber builds.
