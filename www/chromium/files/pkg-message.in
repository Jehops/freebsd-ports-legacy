For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Chromium by performing the following command as root:

    # sysctl kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf:

    kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE and newer have this set by default.

Chromium has a known problem of hanging tabs. The workaround
for this problem is to mount ~/.cache/chromium as memory-fs.
In order to do this, before you run Chromium, please run the
following script as root once for each user who uses Chromium
(replace {user}/{group} with your user/group names):

    # %%DATADIR%%/fix-hanging-tabs.sh {user} {group}
