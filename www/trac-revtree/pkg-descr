This Trac plugin renders a graphical representation of the repository.
The plugin collects the repository's revisions and rebuilds the
branches based on the names of the files changed in each revision.

Filters can be used to choose which branches and which revisions
are to be displayed.  Each depicted changeset is a clickable item
that redirects the browser to the appropriate changeset view.

Whenever the mouse cursor is hovered over a revtree changeset, the
browser opens a tool tip box that shows the revision number, the
author and the date of the revision along with the wiki-formatted
log message.

The plugin also shows branch cloning/tagging operations, and can
be extended to render other kinds of operations such as merging.
