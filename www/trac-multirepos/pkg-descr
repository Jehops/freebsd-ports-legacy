Multiple repositories Trac version
----------------------------------

This branch adds support for accessing multiple repositories inside one Trac
project and based on 0.12 development version of Trac.

Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management.
Our mission; to help developers write great software while staying out of
the way.  Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established
development process and policies.

What is Trac?

    * An integrated system for managing software projects
    * An enhanced wiki
    * A flexible web-based issue tracker
    * An interface to the Subversion revision control system

At the core of Trac lies an integrated wiki and issue/bug database.  Using
wiki markup, all objects managed by Trac can directly link to other
issues/bug reports, code changesets, documentation and files.
