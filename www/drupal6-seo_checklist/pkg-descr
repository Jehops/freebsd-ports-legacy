SEO_checklist is a Drupal module which provides a checklist of good "SEO"
(Search Engine Optimization) actions that you should take to maximize the
presence of your Drupal website in the major search engines like Google,
Yahoo, Live, etc.  It provides a checklist that helps you keep track of what
needs to be done.  First, it will look to see what modules you already have
installed.  Then, all you have to do is go down the list of unchecked items
and do them.
