mod_snake was created in an attempt to give Apache 1.3
and 2.0 developers the power to create easy and flexible
modules in the Python programming language. Aside from giving
modules the same power as they have in C, mod_snake also
provides APIs similar to that of mod_python and mod_perl
for simple module creation, accelerated Python CGIs, and
embedded Python.
