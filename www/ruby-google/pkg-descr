Ruby/Google offers a higher-level abstraction of Google's new
SOAP-driven Web API.  It allows you to programmatically query the
Google search-engine from the comfort of your favourite programming
language.

The aim of the library is to make the details of the raw data
structures returned by the Web API irrelevant, in the process making
the API more accessible for everyday use.

Demonstration programs are included in the archive.
