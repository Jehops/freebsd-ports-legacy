Create a new VirtualHost for your fluxcms installation.

Be sure to have AllowOverride and mod_rewrite enabled in Apache.
A simple VirtualHost entry may look as following: 

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		DocumentRoot %%PREFIX%%/www/fluxcms
		ServerName fluxcms.yourdomain.org
		<Directory %%PREFIX%%/www/fluxcms>
			AllowOverride All
		</Directory>     
	</VirtualHost>

Open up the webbased installer: http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/install/
Go through that. If everything works ok, Flux CMS is set up.
Open your newly installed Flux CMS with http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/
The admin can be reached with http://fluxcms/admin/ (the trailing slash is
important right now). You can log in with the data provided in the installer. 

If you are upgrading from an older version of fluxcms, please remove the 
content of the tmp directory in your fluxcms installation:
	
	rm -rf %%PREFIX%%/www/fluxcms/tmp/*

After that please login in your admin interface of your installation and 
provide a database update:

	http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/admin/
	http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/admin/webinc/update/
