Create a new VirtualHost for your fluxcms installation.

Be sure to have AllowOverride and mod_rewrite enabled in Apache.
A simple VirtualHost entry may look as following: 

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		DocumentRoot %%PREFIX%%/www/fluxcms
		ServerName fluxcms.yourdomain.org
		<Directory %%PREFIX%%/www/fluxcms>
			AllowOverride All
		</Directory>     
	</VirtualHost>

Open up the webbased installer: http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/install/
Go through that. If everything works ok, Flux CMS is set up.
Open your newly installed Flux CMS with http://fluxcms.yourdomain.org/
The admin can be reached with http://fluxcms/admin/ (the trailing slash is
important right now). You can log in with the data provided in the installer.
