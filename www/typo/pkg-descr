Typo is an absolutely minimal weblogging engine powered by rails. It
supports XMLRPC posting, ping/trackback, comments, textile, categories,
all common exports, fulltext search and so on.

Typo makes it fast and easy to weblog, enabling posting through a rich
desktop client application like MarsEdit or ecto (see below for a
compatible clients list). A web-based administration interface handles
configuration and management.
