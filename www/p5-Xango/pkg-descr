Xango is a framework for writing web crawlers. As such, it doesn't do
a whole lot by itself - you need to create custom handlers to do the
grunt work. See the documentation for Xango::Manual::Intro for more
details on how to write your own crawler.

Please note that Xango is still in beta. Some behavior may change as
we keep on developing it.
