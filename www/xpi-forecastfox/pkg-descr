Forecastfox is an extension that brings international weather from
AccuWeather.com to your Firefox web browser. You can use your US zip code or
you can easily find your town or city by using the built in search tool. It is
unobtrusive and lightweight, yet can be customized to display nearly as much
data as the leading desktop weather programs!
