If you are upgrading from version 6, it is recommended to backup your personal
"~/.opera" directory and remove it before starting the upgraded Opera for the
first time. This can be done from the command line using 
"mv ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup".

If you are running FreeBSD 5.x and are experiencing a core dump when starting
Opera, try updating the compat4x port.
