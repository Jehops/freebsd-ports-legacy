Blogd is an SCGI application server dedicated to serving-up a single blog,
implemented in 1000 lines of Munger(1).  Blogd creates the simplest blog
that is still useful, in its author's estimation.  On a single-core system,
it should be able to service 500 requests/second.  More cores will yield
proportionally better performance.
