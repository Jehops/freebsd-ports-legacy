GNUJSP is a free implementation of Sun's Java Server Pages. Once the
GNUJSP servlet is correctly installed, files with the extension .jsp
are translated into java source files, compiled, and run. Although
this software is quite stable, there is no 1.0 release yet, because
the JSP specification has not been finalized yet.
