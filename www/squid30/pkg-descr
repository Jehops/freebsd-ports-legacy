This is the Squid Internet Object Cache developed by the National
Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR) and Internet
volunteers.  This software is freely available for anyone to use.

This software is based on the Harvest Object Cache developed by
the University of Colorado and the University of Southern California.
The Harvest home page is http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/.

ARPA funding for the Harvest project has ended, the squid project has
continued development of the cache where Harvest finished.

This port provides many configuration options, most of which are
available via 'make config'.
