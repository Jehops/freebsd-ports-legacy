The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of
the Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server.  With mod_perl
it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl.  In addition,
the persistent interpreter embedded in the server avoids the overhead of
starting an external interpreter and the penalty of Perl start-up time.
