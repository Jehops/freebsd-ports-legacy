FHTTPD is a relatively new HTTP/FTP daemon that supports modules, 
in particular, for PHP3. It's a feasible alternative to Apache, 
but only for certain situations (for reasons given below). For
example, if one wishes only to run one daemon for both the FTP
and HTTP services, they can do that with FHTTPD.

Unfortunately, at this time, FHTTPD does not seem to offer the 
capability of running as non-root after binding to privileged 
ports. Not to mention that the code itself is not very 
self-documenting... it is of a poor programming style.
