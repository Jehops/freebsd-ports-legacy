HTML::Template::Associate bridges gap between HTML::Template and 
other modules that can be used in conjunction with it to do something 
useful together, like for example Data::FormValidator that can verify form
inputs. 

The primary reason I wrote this is that I needed something to bridge those
two and the thought of creating something more expandable came to mind.
