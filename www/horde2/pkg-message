************************************************************************
Horde has been installed in %%HORDEDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

You have to update the file %%HORDEDIR%%/config/horde.php:
select a backend for authenticating users at the line
conf['auth']['driver'] of the section 'Horde Authentication'
(tip: if you plan to install imp, you should have an IMAP server,
and you may select 'imap').
Select a log driver; if you keep 'file', do not forget to add a line
in /etc/newsyslog.conf.
Then select and configure a preferences driver.

If you want Horde to access a database, you have to run the
appropriate scripts located in %%HORDEDIR%%/scripts/db.

It is recommended that you change the password of the 'hordemgr'
user used to connect to the horde database.
Horde is setup by default to access MySQL.

Your %%APACHE_CONF%% has been updated,
you have to restart Apache.

When everything is OK, you should be able to access Horde from
<URL:http://localhost/horde/>.
(If <URL:http://localhost/horde/> does not run, but
 <URL:http://localhost/horde/index.php> is OK, then you have
 to define index.php as a DirectoryIndex in %%APACHE_CONF%%.)

There is a testing script at <URL:http://localhost/horde/test.php>.

The script horde_set_perms.sh has been installed in %%HORDESBIN%%.
