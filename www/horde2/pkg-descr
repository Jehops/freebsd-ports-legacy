Horde  2.0 is a massive upgrade of the Horde Application Framework.

Many components have been added or streamlined. Inter-application
support is much more robust, a generic MIME_Viewer framework is
included, the preferences system supports global or application scope
for preferences, and assorted bugs have been fixed.

Horde is used by these ports: mail/imp, mail/turba, devel/chora,
deskutils/kronolith, deskutils/nag, www/jonah and net/nic.
