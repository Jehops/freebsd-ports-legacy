*******************************************************************************
       All initial config files have been placed under a samples/ directory.
       You will need to copy these files into the config directory before
       running DansGuardian for the first time.

       This port has created a log file named dansguardian.log that can get
       quite large.  Please read the newsyslog(8) man page for instructions
       on configuring log rotation and compression.

       This port has been converted to the new RC framework and should work
       correctly via rcorder.  Please read the comments in the startup script
       for instructions on enabling the daemon.

       DG_CLAMAV, DG_ICAP, or DG_KASP are all experimental options that I am
       not able to test.  Let me know how these work (or not) for you.
