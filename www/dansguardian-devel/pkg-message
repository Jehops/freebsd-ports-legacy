===>   Please Note:

*******************************************************************************
       This port has created a log file named dansguardian.log that can get
       quite large.  Please read the newsyslog(8) man page for instructions
       on configuring log rotation and compression.

       This port has been converted to the new RC framework and should work
       correctly via rcorder.  Please read the comments in the startup script
       for instructions on enabling the daemon.

       DG_CLAMAV, DG_ICAP, DG_KASP, DG_NTLM are all experimental options that I
       am not currently able to test.  Let me know how these work (or not)
       for you.  (Patches always welcome.)
