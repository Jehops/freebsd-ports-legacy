The Panels module allows a site administrator to create customized layouts
for multiple uses. At its core it is a drag and drop content manager that
let's you visually design a layout and place content within that layout.
Integration with other systems allows you to create nodes that use this,
landing pages that use this, and even override system pages such as taxonomy
and the node page so that you can customize the layout of if your site with
very fine grained permissions.
