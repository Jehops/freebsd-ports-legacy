This is a port of the CakePHP web application framework. CakePHP is a
free open-source rapid development framework for PHP. It's a structure
of libraries, classes and run-time infrastructure for programmers
creating web applications originally inspired by the Ruby on Rails
framework. Our primary goal is to enable you to work in a structured
and rapid manner - without loss of flexibility.
