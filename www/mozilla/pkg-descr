This is the netscape web-surfboard.  Please read the file
"/usr/local/lib/netscape/LICENSE" for the licensing terms.

Note: If the standalone navigator hangs on startup eating all CPU
time, find the user_pref("browser.startup.license_accepted", ...);
line in your ~/.netscape/preferences.js and move it to the end of
the file, or remove it, if simply moving doesn't help.
Don't forget to report this bug to Netscape Team.

Note: If Java applets fail to display.  Type this as root:
		cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
		/usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir
		chmod 444 fonts.dir
      And then exit and restart your X server.
