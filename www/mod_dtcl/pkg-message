	Please, follow the instructions in
		file:/usr/local/share/doc/mod_dtcl/INSTALL.html

	(where  /usr/local may  be  replaced  by your  machine's
	setting for PREFIX) to enable the mod_dtcl's usage.

	Note, that the dtcl.tcl mentioned in the instructions is
	installed as /usr/local/share/mod_dtcl/dtcl.tcl .

	The mentioning of mod_dtcl is already in the Apache's config
	file, but it is commented out -- you have to uncomment it
	manually.
