	Please, follow the instructions in
		file:/usr/local/share/doc/mod_dtcl/documentation.html

	(where  /usr/local may  be  replaced  by a  machine's
	setting for LOCALBASE) to enable the mod_dtcl's usage.

	The mentioning of mod_dtcl is already in the Apache's config
	file, but it is commented out -- you have to uncomment it
	manually and add the line:
		AddType application/x-httpd-tcl .ttml
