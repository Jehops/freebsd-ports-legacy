This module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password
files. These files (and htaccess) are used to do Basic Authentication
on a web server.

The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated
crypted password. You can use this for non-Apache files if you wish,
but it was written specifically for .htaccess style files.
