# Build has to be done in the final location after installing the sources

do-build:	# empty, but needs to be there for the python dependency.

# The web server's "root" directory used to be ${PREFIX}/www, and from
# then on, data, cgi-bin and such. Thus, I decided that Zope belongs
# there, too. I don't know whether this still applies to current apache
# releases, though. I still run 2.2.8-STABLE.

# I decided to consider the whole souce tree to be part of the package
# since in there, Zope can live on its own. It does leave some *.o files
