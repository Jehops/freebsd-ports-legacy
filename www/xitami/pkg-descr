Based on the SMT multithreading kernel from iMatix, the Xitami ['shi-tami'] 
web server is scalable and efficient, especially at high loads. Unlike Apache, 
NCSA httpd, Netscape's Enterprise Server, or IIS, Xitami handles all 
connections (except CGI) within a single process, without creating child 
processes or multiple threads. The cost of a connection ('hit') is extremely 
low.

Xitami supports the main HTTP operations: GET, POST, HEADER. It also supports 
virtual hosts, CGI, clickable image maps, CERN/NCSA logging, log cycling, 
protected directories, direct execution of Perl programs, and browser-based 
configuration and management. It does not support secure sockets.

Xitami is available for multiple platforms (UNIX, OpenVMS, Win 3.x, Win 95, 
Win NT, OS/2) and is free software. Please read the Xitami license agreement 
for details.
