This module adds a webform nodetype to your Drupal site. Typical uses for
Webform are questionnaires, contact or request/register forms, surveys,
polls or a front end to issues tracking systems.

Submissions from a webform are saved in a database table and can optionally
be mailed to a nominated e-mail address upon submission. Past submissions
are viewable for users with the correct permissions.

Webform includes some simple statistical tools to help in form design and
evaluation and also allows the whole table to be downloaded as a csv file
for detailed statistical analysis.
