ZWiki is a WikiWikiWeb clone built on top of the Zope application server
(http://www.zope.org/).

WikiWebs are non-linear online interactive discussion forums - see the
original WikiWikiWeb at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki.  The fact that ZWiki has
been implemented as a Zope product allows it to be tightly integrated with
other Zope products, and this makes ZWiki especially useful as part of a
larger community-oriented site.

ZWiki is fully customisable and comes with several examples demonstrating
various ways to implement a WikiWeb.  It has a number of advanced features
which elevate it above the run-of-the-mill Wiki clone.
