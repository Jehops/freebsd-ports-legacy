===> ZWiki post-port installation instructions:
  To complete the installation of this port, you need to restart Zope. This
  may be done from the Zope Control Panel in the Zope management interface.

  You will now be able to create a "ZWiki Web" object.

  Note:  The page header image in a ZWiki Web will be broken if your Zope
  server interfaces with Apache via PCGI (as the FreeBSD Zope port does by
  default).  To work around this, place a ZWikiPage_icon.gif in your ZWiki
  Web's Zope folder, and edit the standard_wiki_header DTML Method to point
  to this image instead.
