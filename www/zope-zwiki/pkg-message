===> ZWiki post-port installation instructions:
  To complete the installation of this port, you need to perform two further
  steps:

  1. Restart Zope.  This may be done from the Zope Control Panel in the Zope
     management interface.

  2. Import the example ZWikiWebs into Control_Panel/Products.  These 
     have been placed in your Zope import directory as the following file:

       ZWikiWebs.zexp

     You cannot add these examples as the Zope superuser; add it as a Zope
     user with Manager privileges instead.  From the Control_Panel/Products
     folder, click the Import/Export button, and type the name given a above
     as the Import file name.

  You will now be able to create a "ZWiki Web" object.

  Note:  The page header image in a ZWiki Web will be broken if your Zope
  server interfaces with Apache via PCGI (as the FreeBSD Zope port does by
  default).  To work around this, place a ZWikiPage_icon.gif in your ZWiki
  Web's Zope folder, and edit the standard_wiki_header DTML Method to point
  to this image instead.
