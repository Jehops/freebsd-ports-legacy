This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail
user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version on FreeBSD is necessary if
you want to use Linux versions of plugins.  Many plugins are distributed only
as Linux binaries.  The Macromedia Flash plugin is available, as are the
Canadian and United States region packs, spell-checker, and talkback.  AOL
Instant Messenger is omitted (see ports/net/aim).
