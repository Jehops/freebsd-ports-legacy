This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java
and Macromedia Flash plugins are included.  AOL Instant Messenger
is omitted (see ports/net/aim).  The Canadian and United States
region packs, spell-checker, and talkback are available.

The Java plugin requires linux_base-6.  It does not work with
linux_base 7.1.
