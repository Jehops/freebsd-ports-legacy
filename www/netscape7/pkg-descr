This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java
and Macromedia Flash plugins are included.  AOL Instant Messenger
is omitted (see ports/net/aim).  The Canadian and United States
region packs, spell-checker, and talkback are available.

The Java plugin does not work.

This port installs a preview release of the Netscape browser.
Historically, such versions have contained a "time bomb" which will
cause the program to stop working after a predetermined date, usually
a few months after Netscape first offers the program.  If this is
unsuitable for you, use a regular release instead.
