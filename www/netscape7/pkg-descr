This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java
and Macromedia Flash plugins are included.  AOL Instant Messenger
is omitted (see ports/net/aim).  The Canadian, Latin American and
British region packs, spell-checker, and talkback are enabled.

Messenger can be started by going to a mailto: or news: URL (for
example, by typing into the location window).  The dialogs for
saving files and for searching within a document do not work, nor
does the Privacy & Security menu, nor does about:plugins.
