You now need to create the DB where Drupal is going to live

 PostgreSQL::
   createdb -U pgsql -W drupal
   createuser -U pgsql -P -e drupal
   createlang -U pgsql -W plpgsql drupal

 MySQL::
   mysqladmin -u dba_user -p create drupal
   mysql -u dba_user -p
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO drupal@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';

You also need to add appropriate configuration directives to your apache
configuration file (%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache(2)/httpd.conf).

A typical configuration might read:

    Alias /drupal "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%"
    <Directory "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%">
        Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

Please see http://drupal.org/cron for important information on setting up
periodic maintenance tasks in Drupal.

For important information about upgrading from previous versions of Drupal, please 
please see: %%DRUPAL_DIR%%/doc/UPGRADE.txt
