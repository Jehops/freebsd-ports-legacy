Horde-devel is a massive upgrade of the Horde Application Framework.

Many components have been added or streamlined. Inter-application
support is much more robust, a generic MIME_Viewer framework is
included, the preferences system supports global or application scope
for preferences, and assorted bugs have been fixed.
