c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be used with HTTP proxies
that support the ICAP protocol such as the Shweby or Squid proxy server.
c-icap allows the addition of modules, which can extend its functionality and
services. For instance, such modules can be loggers, authenticators and
authentication methods or access controlers.
