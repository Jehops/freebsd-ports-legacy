phpWebApp is an application framework which makes easy and simple the task of
building PHP web applications based on relational databases. It separates the
task of designing and changing the layout of the application from the task of
implementing the logic of the application, by using XML templates that are an
extension of XHTML. It also simplifies the task of implementing the logic of
the application by offering an event based programming model. In addition,
phpWebApp tries to offer modularity and code reusability to the community of
webApp developers.
