NeoWebScript[tm] is a module for the Apache webserver that allows you to
embed the  Tcl/Tk programming language  in your webpages as  a scripting
tool.  It was  invented by  Karl Lehenbauer,  NeoSoft's Chief  Technical
Officer, and documented, enhanced  and extended by NeoSoft's programmers
and technical writers.

It offers a fast, secure, easy to learn way to do powerful, server-based
interactive programming  directly in  the HTML code  in web  pages. With
NeoWebScript[tm], counters, email forms, graffiti walls, guest books and
visitor tracking are all easy, even for a beginning programmer.

NWS  uses plenty  of its  own extensions  to TCL  and those  provided by
eXtended  TCL, gd,  and others.  All other  TCL extensions  can also  be
loaded on the fly.
