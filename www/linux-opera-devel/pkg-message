Changelog for 7.54 Final: http://www.opera.com/linux/changelogs/754/

The name of the the binary, data directory, personal "~/.opera" directory,
etc., have been renamed from "opera" to "linux-opera." This means that
www/linux-opera and www/opera no longer conflict, and can be installed and
can run at the same time. Bookmarks and mail can be preserved by copying
~/.opera/mail and ~/.opera/opera6.adr into ~/.linux-opera. Configurations for
toolbars, options, etc., have changed from previous versions, and are not
recommend to transferred from the old configuration. The mail format will be
converted to the new format automatically when the new linux-opera is run for
the first time.

*** IMPORTANT: users with custom search.ini ***

If you have a custom search.ini and you've used opera 7.51 or an earlier
version before this upgrade, edit ~/.opera/search.ini _before_ running the 
upgraded Opera for the first time, and change the file version to 4. It should
look like this:

[Version]
File Version=4
