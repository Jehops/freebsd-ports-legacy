Orion, a J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) compliant
Application Server (stable version). It supports all major
standards including HTTP 1.1, JSP 1.1, EJB 1.1, Servlet 2.2,
JNDI 1.2 and others. It also offers clustering support and
some unique auto-deployment features.

This version is only for development use or for
non-commercial use.  You need to purchase a license from
http://www.orionserver.com/ if you would like to use this
server commercially.

This port will install an 'orionctl' script in ${PREFIX}/bin
that can be used to start and stop the server. A man page
for this script is installed.

A script in ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d typically causes Orion to be
started at boot time. This script is in fact a symlink to
the orionctl script.
