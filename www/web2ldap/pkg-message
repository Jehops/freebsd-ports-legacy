Run /usr/local/web2ldap/sbin/web2ldap.py to start the standalone version
of web2ldap. By default it only accepts connections from localhost, but
this can be modified in 

   /usr/local/web2ldap/etc/web2ldap/web2ldapcnf/standalone.py

For instructions on installing the CGI version of web2ldap, please look
at the enclosed documentation in /usr/local/web2ldap/htdocs/.
