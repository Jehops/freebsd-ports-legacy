This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.

In this port/package, the Java virtual machine does not work.  AOL
Instant Messenger is omitted because of security problems (see
http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2000/a121200-1.txt).
Only the U.S. English locale is installed.
