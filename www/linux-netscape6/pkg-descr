This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java
and Macromedia Flash plugins are included.  AOL Instant Messenger
is omitted (see ports/net/aim).  The Canadian, Latin American and
British region packs, spell-checker, and talkback are enabled.

Text cannot be typed into the dialogs for saving files or for
searching within a document.

The Java plugin does not work with linux_base-7, only linux_base-61
or linux_base-62.
