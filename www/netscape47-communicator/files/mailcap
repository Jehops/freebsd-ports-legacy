# Example .mailcap file for FreeBSD machines
#
# First a note about syntax:
#    The first token in a configuration line represents a mime type.
#    A mime type is of the form "SubGroup/Item" and either token
#    can be replaced by the wildcard character "*"
# 
#    the second token is the command that you would run
#    when the specified mime type is encountered.  An example
#    would be "xv %s" where %s will be replaced by a filename
#
#    remaining tokens represent name value pairs.
#
#    the "test=<SOME TEST COMMAND>" pair invokes the test command
#    specified and checks the UNIX shell return code to see if the
#    test passed.  If the test passes the mime mapping is made, otherwise
#    the mapping is not made.
#
#    the "stream-buffer-size=<NUMBER>" pair tells the application
#    to use a popen command to invoke the program specified and to
#    pipe all data into the command.  Only programs that can handle
#    piped input can use this method.  When this method is used
#    a "%s" should not be included in the command.  You should
#    make sure that the program you wish to use can accept piped
#    data by trying something like this before using it:
#       cat "YOUR_DATA_FILE_HERE" | COMMAND_TO_TEST
#
#    You may continue lines by using the backslash character "\"

# FreeBSD doesn't seem to support `sfplay' yet, but if a port comes
# along then the following should be enabled.
#
# plays AIFF files
#audio/x-aiff; sfplay %s

# plays AIFC files
#audio/x-aifc; sfplay %s

# FreeBSD has no wavplay utility either, but if someone
# would care to port one then this can also be used.
# plays WAV files
#audio/x-wav; wavplay %s > /dev/null 2>&1

# FreeBSD /dev/audio is sun compliant
audio/basic; cat %s > /dev/audio

# use this to play MPEG audio if you have maplay installed  
audio/x-mpeg; maplay -; stream-buffer-size=2000

# use this to play MPEG video files if you have mpeg_play installed
video/mpeg; mpeg_play -quiet %s

# All other anims go well with xanim (if installed)
video/*; xanim %s > /dev/null 2>&1

# use this to display postscript files
application/postscript; ghostview %s

# use this to display pdf files
application/pdf; xpdf %s 2>/dev/null

# this is the default for non GIF or JPEG images
image/*; xv %s

# if you would prefer an external viewer for GIF and JPEG images
# uncomment the following lines for XV to act as your external viewer.
#image/gif; xv %s
#image/jpg; xv %s
#image/jpeg; xv %s
