Netscape Wrapper
        (c) 1998,1999 Dave Cinege, H. Peter Anvin, and Red Hat, Inc.
            2000 Akinori MUSHA <knu@FreeBSD.org>, modified for FreeBSD.

This wrapper first attempts to open the option in a running
netscape. If no netscape is running, one is executed with the option
as the starting window.

The command line options are extended to allow opening New Messages
window, Messenger Mailbox, Collabra Disscussions, Composer, and so on.
