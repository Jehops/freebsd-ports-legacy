 WebCalendar is a PHP-based calendar application that can be configured
as a single-user calendar, a multi-user calendar for groups of users, or
as an event calendar viewable by visitors. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
DB2, Interbase, MS SQL Server, or ODBC is required.

WebCalendar can be setup in a variety of ways, such as...

  * A schedule management system for a single person

  * A schedule management system for a group of people, allowing one or
    more assistants to manage the calendar of another user

  * An events schedule that anyone can view, allowing visitors to submit
    new events

  * A calendar server that can be viewed with iCalendar-compliant calendar
    applications like Mozilla Sunbird, Apple iCal or GNOME Evolution or
    RSS-enabled applications like Firefox, Thunderbird, RSSOwl, FeedDemon,
    or BlogExpress.
