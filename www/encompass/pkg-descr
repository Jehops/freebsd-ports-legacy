Encompass is a web browser for the Gnome Desktop Environment. 

It is designed to be a small fast browser using the GtkHTML engine. It will be
able to share cookies with other apps. It will handle all special URIs and MIME
types. All of this functionality will be provided by the latest version of
Gnome. Bonobo components will also be used, as well as plugins. No file-manager
functions will be implemented.
