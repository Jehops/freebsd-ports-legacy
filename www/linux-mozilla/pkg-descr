This is the Mozilla suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail user
agent, news reader, and IRC client) pre-compiled for Linux.  Instead
of using this port, another way to run plugins which are only
available as Linux binaries is to install the linuxpluginwrapper
port.

This port works with the Java plugin from the java/linux-blackdown-jdk14
port (and perhaps with others).
