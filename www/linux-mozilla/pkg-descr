This is the Mozilla suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail user
agent, news reader, and IRC client) pre-compiled for Linux.  Instead
of using this port, another way to run plugins which are only
available as Linux binaries is to install the linuxpluginwrapper
port.

If you find a Java plugin which works with this port, please tell
the maintainer.
