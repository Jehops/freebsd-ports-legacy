Sort any HTML data table. Simply press 'ctrl', 'alt' keys at the
same time and click inside any table cell, the table will be sorted
based on the data inside that column. The auto-detected data types
include various US-styled date/time, currency, IP address, number,
or text. Further, the context menu provides options to explicitly
specify the data type, thus for example European styled date could
be sorted correctly. One could also set a few options, including
setting European date as the default auto-detected time stamp, etc.
