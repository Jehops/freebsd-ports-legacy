Excerpt from the README:
KWebSearch is a little program for KDE that can call various
search engines with keywords you specify and it opens the result
in your favourite browser (KFM, Netscape, Lynx or Clipboard).
It also gives you Statistics about how often you used which browser
or how often you used which search engine. The engines for the
International Version are : Altavista, Lycos, Goto, Goggle, Datahit,
Ask Jeeves, Yahoo, DMOZ, Deja, Icecast, Audiofind, CDDB, Freshmeat,
Slashdot and more. German and French KWebSearch's have also their
language specific Engines (like the german or french yahoo).

---

KWebSearch's functionality is still under development.. people
who are not running KDE should be careful to select a browser
other than KFM, or else KWebSearch won't work.
