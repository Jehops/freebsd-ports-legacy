Real (and Helix) browser plugins do little else, but start the separate
"realplay" executable and talk to it.

This port builds and installs this simple plugin part. The port allows
to use native FreeBSD browsers with the realplay executable built for
Linux (installed by multimedia/linux-realplayer).

Although the multimedia/helixplayer port installs a modern version of
the player, it lacks certain codecs, which Real/Helix are not allowed to
(or would not) open-source.

This port's "source" is extracted verbatim from the Helix-player's,
which is much larger.

Although tested primarily against firefox, it should build any other
Mozilla-family browser's headers. Care is taken to NOT include browser
headers typically bundled by Helix/Real...
