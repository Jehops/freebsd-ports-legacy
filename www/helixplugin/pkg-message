The port will try to use either "realplay" (see
multimedia/linux-reaplayer) or "hxplay" (see multimedia/helixplayer)
executables.

If you'd like to make the plugin execute anything other than "realplay"
or "hxplay" (based on your PATH), sym-link desired executable to
"realplayer" (or to hxplay), or run the browser with the environment
variable HELIX_PLUGIN_PLAYER_OVERRIDE pointing to the executable you
wish.
