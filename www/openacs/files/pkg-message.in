Congratulations! You have just installed %%OPENACSNAME%%

You need a PostgreSQL server installed and configured on your (or a on remote)
system. We recommend using the PostgreSQL 8.2.x port located in:
databases/postgresql82-server

You may need to adjust your PostgreSQL database configuration (for servers 
v 8.1.x and higher). This can be done with the following script:
%%DOCSDIR%%/adjust_pgsql_conf.sh

If you want adjust the database configuration manually, please visit:
http://openacs.org/xowiki/How_to_install_in_Postgres_8.x

After your local PostgreSQL server is configured and running, you can create 
a default database by running the following script:
%%DOCSDIR%%/create_sampledb.sh

You can start %%OPENACSNAME%% with the startup script:
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/%%PORTNAME%%

If you are using another AOLserver on the default port 8000, 
please change the port number in the configuration file.
Default config: %%OPENACSBASE%%/etc/%%PORTNAME%%-config.tcl
 
Then use your web browser to view the welcome page and follow the instructions.
http://<your-ip>:<port> (default port is 8000)

Errors, if any, are in:
%%OPENACSBASE%%/log/error.log

If you want to use keepalive via cron, you might want to look here:
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/keepalive/
