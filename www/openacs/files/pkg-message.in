     ******** READ THIS *******

Congratulations! You have just installed OpenACS/.LRN

If you didn't  make install WITH_POSTCONFIG=yes
to allow post-install configurations or run now:
sh ${EXAMPLESDIR}/post-config.sh XX POST-INSTALL
Make sure you stop Aolserver and Postgresql 
before post-install configuration starts.

Then use your browser to view the welcome page (http://<your-ip>:8000)
and follow the instructions. (Find out your IP address by typing 
"ifconfig" at the command line)

If you want daemontools to restart aolserver, remember to:
Copy the example svscan.sh from %%EXAMPLESDIR%%
to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/svscan.sh
Make a copy of the original file first, if you like.
Then REBOOT (shutdown -r now)!

Once the datamodel has been installed and aolserver restarts
it can take a few MINUTES before the server becomes available. 
Be patient! 

Errors, if any, are in:
%%VIRTUALBASE%%/aolserver/%%OPENACS_USER%%/log/error.log
 
Go to the docs at http://openacs.org/doc/ to find out more.
There are a few things different from the docs (!): For example, the 
postgres user is pgsql not postgres, daemontools are in %%DTSERVICEBASE%%,
openACS/.LRN is in %%LOCALBASE%%/share/ (with symlink in %%VIRTUALBASE%%), 
nsd-postgres and some other files are in %%EXAMPLESDIR%%, but everything
should work just fine.

To view your pages at port 80 you will have to change:
daemontools/run and config.tcl in
%%VIRTUALBASE%%/aolserver/%%OPENACS_USER%%/etc.

If you install .LRN as well as openACS the IP address in config.tcl
should be different or you should shut one down (svc -d %%DTSERVICEBASE%%/...)
before starting the other. Aolserver cannot listen on the same ip-address
twice!

If you want to remove openacs, type "make deinstall" or use pkg_delete
(pkg_info).
However, users and database are not removed. At (re)install an existing
datadirectory with the same name is moved to <name>.old

We use bash as shell in openACS. We didn't change the shells of
current users like root and pgsql, yet. If you want, do:
chsh -s %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/bash USERNAME 
and change its profile by copying the openACS entries from
/usr/share/skel/dot.profile to  ~/.profile. 
Than login/out or type ". .profile".

Remember: THIS MESSAGE is in PORTSDIR/www/openacs/pkg-message.
