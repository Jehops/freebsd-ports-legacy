Congratulations! You have just installed %%OPENACSNAME%%

To create a sample default database, you first need a PostgreSQL server
installed and configured on your system. If the PostgreSQL server is started 
and running, you can run the script:
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/create_sampledb.sh

The create_sampledb.sh script works with the following servers with their
default configurations:
databases/postgresql74-server (7.4.x)
databases/postgresql80-server (8.0.x)

For PostgreSQL 8.1.x and 8.2.x, the database server configuration
needs to be adjusted. Please visit the following webpage for more information:
http://openacs.org/xowiki/How_to_install_in_Postgres_8.x

You can start %%OPENACSNAME%% with the startup script:
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/%%PORTNAME%%

If you are using another AOLserver on the default port 8000, 
please change the port number in the configuration file.
Default config: %%OPENACSBASE%%/etc/%%PORTNAME%%-config.tcl
 
Then use your browser to view the welcome page (http://<your-ip>:<port>)
- default port is 8000 and follow the instructions.

Errors, if any, are in:
%%OPENACSBASE%%/log/error.log

If you want to use keepalive via cron, you might want to look here:
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/keepalive/
