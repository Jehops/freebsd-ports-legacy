SHTTPD is a simple, easy to use, embeddable web server with CGI,
SSL, cookies support. It is written in C, as one single source file httpd.c,
and compiles both in UNIX and Windows environments. Gives exceptionally
small footprint when linked against uclibc or dietlibc. It is a good choice
to serve Web based GUI for various applications, where other sophisticated
servers like Apache, IIS etc are too big, hard to install and configure or
overcomplicated.
shttpd is licensed under the terms of very liberal MIT license.
