This is the distribution page for the Apache module mod_limitipconn.c, which
allows web server administrators to limit the number of simultaneous downloads
permitted from a single IP address.

Why did I write this module? Well, I run an mp3 server which since its
inception was being constantly hosed by people who were trying to download
dozens of files at once. For months I scoured the Internet looking for a code
snippet that would solve this problem. The closest thing I found was this patch
against an old version of Apache, and it didn't run properly on my Linux box
(that was back then; nowadays, the patch doesn't even apply cleanly to the
 Apache source tree).

Finally I gave up and decided to write something to do the job myself, and
here's the result.
