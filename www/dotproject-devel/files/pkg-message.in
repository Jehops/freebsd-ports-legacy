It is suggested that you add the following to httpd.conf:

You may also need to add read permission for the directory:

    <Directory "%%DOTPROJECTDIR%%">

        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

Previous version of dotProject had bugs when using MySQL 4.x.  If you
are already using MySQL 4.x, you may install databases/mysql323-server
in a jail to avoid conflicts, or consider upgrading to MySQL 5.  Also,
see http://www.dotproject.net/vbulletin/archive/index.php/t-5292.html

the installation.
