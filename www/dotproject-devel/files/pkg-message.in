dotProject has been installed into %%DOTPROJECTDIR%%

It is suggested that you add the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /dotproject/ "%%DOTPROJECTDIR%%/"

dotProject has bugs when using MySQL servers later then version 3.23.
If you had not previously installed MySQL 3.23, you will need access
to a 3.23 server.  You will not be able to install one from this
ports tree.  You can use a remote server, or install one in a jail.
To install a local MySQL 3.23 server you will need to create a jail
and install databases/mysql323-server.

Another option is to patch dotProject to use MySQL 5.  See
http://www.dotproject.net/vbulletin/archive/index.php/t-5292.html

Then access http://<host>/dotproject and follow the instructions to
complete the installation.
