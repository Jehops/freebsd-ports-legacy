and you have to ensure that your PHP installation has been compiled with
support for your database.You have to create a database for zen-cart to use,
and ensure that this database may be accessed and changed by the user id
under which your web server executes.  Further information on these
installation procedures may be found in:

Once these steps have been taken, you may connect to the following URL to
