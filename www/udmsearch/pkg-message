udmsearch is successfully installed.
Now, to use udmsearch you need to create the appropriate mysql database
manually:

  Create mysql database 'udmsearch'.
  You can also use existing MySQL database, skip this step in this case. 

	$ mysqladmin create udmsearch


  Create tables.
  If you are installing UdmSearch for the first time: 

	$ mysql udmsearch < /usr/local/etc/udmsearch/create/create.txt

  IMPORTANT: If you already use UdmSearch and want to upgrade from
  UdmSearch 2.0 or earlier while keep existing data, please do not use
  create.txt. Instead, to upgrade from UdmSearch 2.0, run 

 	$ mysql udmsearch < /usr/local/etc/udmsearch/create/alter20-21.txt

  or, to upgrade from UdmSearch 1.x, run 
        $ mysql udmsearch < /usr/local/etc/udmsearch/create/alter19-20.txt
        $ mysql udmsearch < /usr/local/etc/udmsearch/create/alter20-21.txt
