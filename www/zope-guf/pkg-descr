GenericUserFolder (GUF) is a Zope product which allows you to "roll your own"
Zope user folders.

Using GUF you can authenticate users of Zope-based applications using SQL
databases, NIS, LDAP, or whatever other technology you can conceive, limited
only by your ability to write the code to interface with that technology.

NOTE:  GUF is regarded as being deprecated in favour of the LoginManager
       product.  However, due to the relative complexity of LoginManager (and
       the straightforward simplicity of GUF), GUF is still widely used.
