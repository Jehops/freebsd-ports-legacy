WDialog is an advanced system to create dialog-centric web applications.

Feature list:

 * Separation of the user interface (UI) definition from the backend
   program.
 * The UI definition is contained in an XML file.
 * The dialogs have built-in persistency for session state.
 * A powerful template system manages the combination of individual
   HTML fragments to whole pages.
 * The dialogs behave like GUI widgets.
 * The callbacks are written in a real programming language (Objective
   Caml, or Perl).
 * The application can run as CGI as well as application server.
 * The WDialog toolkit itself does not require any database as backend
   store.
 * WDialog preprocesses all web inputs, and ensures that minimum
   security standards are fulfilled.
