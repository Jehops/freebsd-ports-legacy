TYPO3 is a free Open Source content management system for enterprise purposes
on the web and in intranets. It offers full flexibility and extendability while
featuring an accomplished set of ready-made interfaces, functions and modules.

Outdated stable release
Support for this version will be dropped entirely when TYPO3 4.7 is released.
Updating to TYPO3 4.6 is seriously recommended.
