POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR MOODLE
=====================================

1) Create a user and a database for Moodle to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).
   NOTE: this package assumes that either the php4-pgsql
   or php4-mysql packages are installed, as needed.

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory ${PREFIX}/www/data/moodledata>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Deny,Allow
      Deny from all 
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/moodle), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Moodle, creating an admin account etc.

4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so. You can do so by using wget,
   links or something similar to open the web page
   http://your.server.com/moodle/admin/cron.php.
