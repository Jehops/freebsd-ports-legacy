POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR MOODLE
=====================================

1) Create a user and a database for Moodle to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).
   It doesn't matter what the database or user names are,
   as this will be configured in a later step.
   NOTE: this package assumes that either the phpX-pgsql
   or phpX-mysql packages are installed, as needed.

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   Alias /moodle %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On  ### Add this directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all 
   </Directory>
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDATADIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Deny,Allow
      Deny from all 
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/moodle/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Moodle, creating an admin account, etc.

   At one step, you will get a message saying that the
   installer script was not able to automatically create
   the config.php file. Just download it and copy it to
   %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%/config.php. Beware that it
   will contain the database password in cleartext, so
   set up whatever file permissions you deem more adequate.
   For instance, user=root, group=www, mask=640.

4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so. You can do so by using wget,
   links or something similar to open the web page
   http://your.server.com/moodle/admin/cron.php.
