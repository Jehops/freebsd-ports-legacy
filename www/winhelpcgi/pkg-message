winhelpcgi.cgi has been installed into %%PREFIX%%/www/winhelpcgi/

You now need to copy winhelp files into %%PREFIX%%/www/winhelpcgi/

You also need to somehow make your webserver aware of winhelpcgi.
For example, the following config fragment would make apache aware
of winhelpcgi:

Alias /winhelpcgi %%PREFIX%%/www/winhelpcgi
<Directory /usr/local/www/winhelpcgi>
      AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
      AllowOverride All
      Options ExecCGI
</Directory>
