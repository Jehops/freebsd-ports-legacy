afterBURNER*Cache is a tool to speed up web applications written
in PHP.
It works by caching inside the web server compiled PHP code (the
first time it's executed) so that the next time the same script
is called it is simply restored, already compiled, from the cache
with big savings in terms of execution time.
Caching and saving scripts at compile time can be a big performance
win, especially if your PHP script is complex and makes heavy use
of libraries.
