Dillo aims to be a multiplatform browser alternative that's small,
stable, developer-friendly, usable, fast, and extensible.

This package adds multilingualization and a lot of other features missing
from plain dillo.  Please see http://teki.jpn.ph/pc/software/index-e.shtml
for further information.

NOTE:
This patched version of dillo is not supported by the dillo developers.
