    # In order to support concurrent multiplexing of requests over a
    # single connection, mod_spdy maintains its own thread pool in
    # each Apache child process for processing requests.  The default
    # size of this thread pool is very conservative; you can override
    # it with a larger value (as below) to increase concurrency, at
    # the possible cost of increased memory usage.

    # Memory usage can also be affected by the maximum number of
    # simultaneously open SPDY streams permitted for each client
    # connection.  Ideally, this limit should be set as high as
    # possible, but you can tweak it as necessary to limit memory
    # consumption.
