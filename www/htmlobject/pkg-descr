The HTML Document Object allows you as a programmer to quickly and easily
generate dynamic HTML documents without having to deal with all the HTML
overhead at every step of the way. For example, you have the ability to
generate a cookie at any point, until you actually display the document. 

The HTML Document Object provides a template object that you fill in with
the content you want displayed. You still have to order your content in the
order it should show, but you don't have to generate all your JavaScript code
first and then your body, you can intermingle them and the HTML Document
Object will take care of keeping track of where everything goes.
