NOTE:

Edit the %%PREFIX%%/etc/pluggerrc file as needed. It should work
fine as is. If you had a previous %%PREFIX%%/etc/pluggerrc file,
it will be renamed %%PREFIX%%/etc/pluggerrc.old.

This Plugger port will install a default set of multimedia utilities
that I have found to work well. Other combinations may work also.
Look at the pluggerrc file for details.

Plugger searches for pluggerrc files in the following order:

~/.netscape/pluggerrc
~/.mozilla/pluggerrc
$MOZILLA_HOME/pluggerrc  (MOZILLA_HOME is usually equal to HOME)
/etc/pluggerrc
/usr/etc/pluggerrc
%%PREFIX%%/etc/pluggerrc
./pluggerrc

Whichever pluggerrc is found first in the above order will be
used, no merging of other pluggerrc's occurs. You have been warned.

NOTES on Sound:

Remember, you have to have the Timidity patch files installed for
it to work.

Also, some of the frequency settings are extremely sound-card
dependent. If you get no sound, adjust the frequency settings in
your pluggerrc to be compatible with your sound card. See the
documentation for the various sound utilities for details.
