Have you ever wanted to mount those HTTP directory listings as if it was a
partition? Look no further, this is your solution. HTTPDirFS stands for Hyper
Text Transfer Protocol Directory Filesystem.

The performance of the program is excellent. HTTP connections are reused due to
the use of curl-multi interface. The FUSE component runs in multithreaded mode.

There is a permanent cache system which can cache all the file segments you
have downloaded, so you don't need to these segments again if you access them
later. This feature is triggered by the --cache flag. This makes this
filesystem much faster than rclone mount.

The support for Airsonic / Subsonic server has also been added. This allows you
to mount a remote music collection locally.
