Before Inside Systems Mail will work:
======================================

An ismail.conf file must be created and placed in

%%WWWDIR%%/include

A reference ismail.conf has been provided at

%%WWWDIR%%/include/ismail.conf.sample

but requires modification to work. Please check the
provided HTML documentation in %%DOCSDIR%% or browse
http://www.insidesystems.net/projects/project.php?projectid=4
for configuration help.

Note: 
For alternate datastores to domxml, check
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%
for sample postgresql and mysql schemas and set the ismail.conf file accordingly.
