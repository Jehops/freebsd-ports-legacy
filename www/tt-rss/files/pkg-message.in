Tiny Tiny RSS is now installed, but it requires some additional setup.

You now need to create a database, a database user, and
configure the web server.  Sample apache24 configs located at
%%DATADIR%%/httpd-tt-rss.conf

To use the web installer.
    # rm %%WWWDIR%%/config.php
    Goto http://localhost/tt-rss/install

Or configure by hand:
    Source the script
    %%WWWDIR%%/schema/ttrss_schema_%%DB%%.sql

    Edit the configuration file
    %%WWWDIR%%/config.php

In both cases, enable the ttrssd daemon:
    # sysrc ttrssd_enable=YES
    # service ttrssd start

If your database if on another server:
    # sysrc ttrssd_local_db=NO

Goto http://localhost/tt-rss/
Default user is "admin", with the password "password"

Important note: after an upgrade, you have to set SINGLE_USER_MODE to true
in your config.php; remember to modify after that if needed. Also your
DB_USER must be granted to ALTER any tables of your DB_NAME.
