HTTP::GHTTP

This module is a simple interface to the Gnome project's libghttp.

It allows you to make very simple HTTP requests, without the weight
of something like LWP. This makes it very useful in situations where
memory and speed are at a premium, such as mod_perl.

It has full support for proxy requests and authenticated requests.
