Nice Menus is a module for the Drupal CMS which enables drop-down / right /
left expandable menus. The module uses CSS to display the menus on browsers
which have functional CSS.  Internet Explorer is supported using Javascript.

Three styles of menus are currently possible: horizontal (menus drop down);
vertical (menus drop to the left); vertical (menus drop to the right).
