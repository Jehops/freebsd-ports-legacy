* Please read docs/README (http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/README) or browse
to http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_documentation on HOW-TO get OJS fully
functional

* See lib/libraries.txt for a list of third-party libraries used
by OJS.

Recommended Configuration -------------------------

A secure deployment can be best achieved by using the following
policies:

	* Dedicate a database to OJS; use unique credentials to
	access it.  Configure this database to perform automated
	backups on a regular basis. Perform a manual backup when
	upgrading or performing maintenance.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use SHA1 hashing rather
	than MD5.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use force_ssl_login so
	that authenticated users communicate with the server via
	HTTPS.

	* Install OJS so that the files directory is NOT a subdirectory
	of the OJS installation and cannot be accessed directly via
	the web server. Restrict file permissions as much as possible.
	Automated backups of this directory should be roughly
	synchronized with database backups.

======================================================================
OJS now supports article galleys that will be automatically rendered
from an uploaded XML source file, using a specific XSL stylesheet
transformation.

If you want to use this feature please install:

	* textproc/php5-xsl if you have PHP 5 installed

	* textproc/php4-xslt if you have PHP 4 installed

	* External command-line XSLT renderer (eg. Xalan) and enter
	the complete path to the XSLT renderer tool, with any
	required arguments in the XMLGalleyPlugin settings.

If you want to enable rendering PDF galleys using XSL-FO you may
want to install a FO processor (eg. textproc/fop) and configure it
in the XMLGalleyPlugin settings.

If you have chosen memcached you need to configure your memcached
server setting on config.inc.php.

There are other options that can and should be configured at
config.inc.php.
