* See lib/libraries.txt for a list of third-party
 libraries used by OJS.

Recommended Configuration
-------------------------

A secure deployment can be best achieved by using the following policies:

	* Dedicate a database to OJS; use unique credentials to access it.
	  Configure this database to perform automated backups on a regular
	  basis. Perform a manual backup when upgrading or performing
	  maintenance.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use SHA1 hashing rather than MD5.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use force_ssl_login so that
	  authenticated users communicate with the server via HTTPS.

	* Install OJS so that the files directory is NOT a subdirectory of
	  the OJS installation and cannot be accessed directly via the web
	  server. Restrict file permissions as much as possible. Automated
	  backups of this directory should be roughly synchronized with
	  database backups.
