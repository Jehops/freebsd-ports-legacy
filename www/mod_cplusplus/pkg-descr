mod_cplusplus is a proper apache module which allows you to load cpp objects
as handlers for Apache-2.0.  It differs from other modules i've seen in that
it manages the loading and calling of separate shared objects containing your
handler classes.  This allows you to easily and cleanly run an entire site
with c++ handlers.
