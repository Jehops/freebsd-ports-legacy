+  * "System" CGI modification 97.05.10 by Rick Franchuk (rickf@netnation.com)
+  *
+  * I found that while it's great to make scripts run under the UID and GID
+  * specified in httpd.conf or what /etc/passwd says is 'cool', suEXEC can
+  * really put a damper on 'System' cgi's, forcing copies of the scripts
+  * to be installed into users' home directories. That didn't seem very
+  * fitting... so I changed it so that the target UID check is disabled in
+  * a system directory #defined in suexec+.h. I hope you all find it useful.
+  *
+  * The docroot check had to be bypassed to allow functionality for VirtualHost
+  * entries. I'm somewhat suprised noone encountered that behavior before.
