Rectang XSM (eXtensible Site Manager)

XSM is a new Content management system for generating fast web sites.
The system generates "static" html pages using Java / JSP renderers.
Published content can be stored locally or distributed over an ssh connection.
The backend uses only XML for easy management and backup.

Using the TinyMCE open source project we can offer a WYSIWYG editor for
editing HTML based document types ("HTML" and "News")

Other Document types include:
  * Html    - (as above) simple WYSIWYG edited page for any content
  * News    - blog style inclue RSS and archive
  * Gallery - generates thumbnails and previews along with pages for browsing
  * Files   - simple file listing for uploading misc files
  * Book    - for collating large, structured documents - generates individual
                pages and a "printer friendly" version.
  * FAQs    - classic structure for a collection of question-answer knowledge
  * PreviewdFile - file list, but providing a preview image and description for
                every file
  * Links   - categorised links for the necessary "links" page
