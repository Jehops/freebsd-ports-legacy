mod_log_spread is a patch to Apache's mod_log_config, which provides
an interface for spread to multicast access logs. It utilizes the
group communication toolkit Spread, developed at Johns Hopkins
University's Center for Networking and Distributed Systems.
mod_log_spread was developed to solve the problem of collecting
consolidated access logs for large web farms. In particular, the
solution needed to be scalable to hundreds of machines, utilize a
reliable network transport, allow machines to added or dropped on
the fly, and impose minimal performance impact on the webservers.
Current version is 1.0.3p3. This makes a fix to a stupid vhost
logging bug as well as providing a complete and flexible log-writing
solution.
