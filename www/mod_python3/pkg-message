Also remember to add to your Apache configuration in the appropriate context:

PythonPath "['/path/to/foo', '/path/to/bar']"
AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler foobar
PythonDebug On

Where PythonPath includes the paths to at least the Python libdir, its
site-packages dir, and to the dir where your Python programs are. Also consider
including the dir to mod_python if your Python distribution is installed in a
non-standard location. For more information, see http://www.modpython.org/.
