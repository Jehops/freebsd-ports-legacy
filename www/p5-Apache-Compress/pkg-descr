This module lets you send the content of an HTTP response as gzip-
compressed data. Certain browsers (Netscape, IE) can request content
compression via the `Content-Encoding' header. This can speed things up
if you're sending large files to your users through slow connections.

Browsers that don't request gzipped data will receive regular
noncompressed data.

This module is compatibile with Apache::Filter, so you can compress the
output of other content-generators.
