# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.
localhost

# Set this path to your site's directory.
root * %%WWWDIR%%

# Enable the static file server.
file_server

# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
# php_fastcgi localhost:9000

# Caddy will automatically obtain ACME certs for domains
# example.com {
#     root * /path/to/example.com
#     file_server
# }

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
