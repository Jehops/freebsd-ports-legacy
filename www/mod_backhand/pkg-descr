mod_backhand is a project that allows load balancing through seemless
HTTP proxying from one web server to another.  This proxying is used
to evenly distribute the load of a site across multiple machines to
that way under-utilized resources are utilized to their fullest, thus
providing fine-grained, per-request HTTP load balancing for a cluster.
