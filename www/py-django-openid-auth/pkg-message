**********************************************************************

To activate OpenID authentication within your Django installation, you
will need to:

    * add 'django_openid_auto' to INSTALLED_APPS,

    * add 'django_auth_openid.auth.OpenIDBackend' to
      AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS,

    * (optional) enable user creation when a new OpenID is used,

    * (optional) have user details updated from SREG or AE extention
      data,

    * hook up the login URLs to your application's urlconf and
      configure the LOGIN_URL and LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL, and

    * re-run "python manage.py syncdb" to add the UserOpenID table to
      your database.

For detailed instructions see the "README.txt" file that came with
this package; an example Django project with OpenID configured is also
included.
