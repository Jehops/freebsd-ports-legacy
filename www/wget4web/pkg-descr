Wget4web allows to add downloads to server, to view information
about download status and to  control it in browser. The program's
interface is look like interfaces of ReGet and Downloader for X,
what allow to control download of many files without review Wget
logs (but if you want to do it, you may watch them in browser window).
Wget4web writes logs and can generate reports including name and size
of downloaded files. You can control traffic which was got by each
user. Users can download files without using shell (Wget4web
use own user list) what decrease possibility of undesirable
server usage.
