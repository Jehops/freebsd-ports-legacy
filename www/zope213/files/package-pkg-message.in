Zope Successfull installed.

To create an instance of Zope please run
%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mkzopeinstance --dir <INSTANCEDIR>

<INSTANCEDIR> is the directory where the instance files should
              be installed. This can be %%ZOPEINSTANCEBASE%%

Command-line options to 'mkzopeinstance' are available, and can be
investigated by running 'mkzopeinstance --help'.

Zope instances, created by mkzopeinstance, will not be removed
when the package is deinstalled. You'll have to delete them yourself.

If Zope should get started automatically when the system starts,
please add the following line to /etc/rc.conf

zope213_enable="YES"

If you are using not default instance location, please add this
line to /etc/rc.conf to make it working:

zope213_instances="<INSTANCEDIR>"

Additional Zope instances have to be added to zope213_instances
separated by a space.
