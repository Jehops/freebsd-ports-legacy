Dillo is a web browser project completely written in C (currently the code
is based on gzilla-0.2.2's widget, and a new improved network engine
written from scratch).

Dillo is small; source and binary are less than 220 Kb each.

Dillo aims to be a multiplatform browser alternative that's small,
stable, developer-friendly, usable, fast, and extensible.

Dillo is mainly based on GTK+ (GNOME is NOT required!)

Dillo is very fast!
