TclDOM is a Tcl language binding for the W3C's DOM standard. DOM
provides a tree view of an XML document.

TclDOM is a package with several implementations, including one
written in pure Tcl, one written in C based on TclDOMPro and
another that wraps the Gnome libxml2 library.
This port installs the TclDOMPro part.
