Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
for putting together web sites.  It comes with functionality for posting
articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more; but it can be
extended in innumerable ways.

Bundle::Slash is a collection of prerequisite perl modules needed before
installing Slash.
