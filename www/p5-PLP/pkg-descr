PLP is yet another Perl embedder, primarily for HTML documents. Unlike with
other Perl embedders, there is no need to learn a meta-syntax or object
model: one can just use the normal Perl constructs. PLP runs under mod_perl
for speeds comparable to those of PHP, but can also be run as a CGI script.

Note that while unofficial, experimental, and not supported, I (PLP's
maintainer) have been using the patch for mod_perl 2 functionality for about a
year's time on servers which are always online. I have yet to encounter any
problems. If you do encounter any, please send a report to me first and I'll do
what I can to see if it's a bug in PLP or a bug in the mod_perl 2 patch.
