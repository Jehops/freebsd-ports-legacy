RT is an industrial-grade ticketing system. It lets a group of people
intelligently and efficiently manage requests submitted by a community
of users. RT is used by systems administrators, customer support
staffs, NOCs, developers and even marketing departments at over a
thousand sites around the world.

RT3 significantly revamped the RT codebase, featuring standard-compliant
Web UI, approval-based workflow system, REST-powered RPC mail gateway,
recursive group membership with delegates, autoconf, custom field support,
I18N and L10N framework, web-editable scrips, better documentation and
regression test suite, and more.

Developed by elixus.org and supported by OurInternet, Inc, rt3-elixus is
a beefed-up branch based on the latest -pre/-rc/-final release of RT3.
It features an alternate Tabbed UI, Workflow editor, many more custom field
types (including multiple-entry fields), Object Attributes, and has been
ported to Microsoft Windows.
