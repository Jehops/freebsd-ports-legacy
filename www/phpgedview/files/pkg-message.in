=======================================
For initial installation with Apache, you should:

1) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.

   Alias /phpGedView %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On

   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

2) Visit your phpGedView site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/phpGedView/)
   and you should be taken to the install script, 
   which will lead you through setting up phpGedView, 
   creating an admin account, etc.
