=======================================
If it's your initial installation, you should:

- Go to /usr/local/www/data/phpGedView/ and copy all files ending
  with -dist to their name without -dist.

- point your web browser to the phpGedView folder
  (http://www.yourserver.com/phpGedView/) to automatically begin
  the online configuration process.
