mod_layout is a utility to wrap served webpages. This means it can
add a footer ot header to a document. This allows you to create a
standard look and feel throughout a website without using SSI.
Some example uses are adding standard disclaimers to the bottom of
all pages, banner ads to the top of all pages, or even a menu at
the beginning of a page. There are many other per-document settings
you can modify with mod_layout; see the file 'faq.html' for more
information.
