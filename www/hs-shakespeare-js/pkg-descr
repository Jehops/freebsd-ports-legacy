Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with
simple variable interpolation.  Shakespeare templates can be used inline
with a quasi-quoter or in an external file.  Shakespeare interpolates
variables according to the type being inserted.  In this case, the
variable type needs a ToJavascript instance.

There is also shakespeare-coffeescript for coffeescript templates.
Coffescript is a language that compiles down to javascript.  It expects
a coffeescript compiler in your path, and variable should be a ToCoffee
instance.
