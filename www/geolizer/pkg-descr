Patch for Webalizer to generate faster and more reliable geographic 
statistics than using default DNS suffix method. It uses GeoIP library to 
do that. In fact, if you disable DNS reversal on your HTTP server, it will 
work faster and your stats get more accuracy when processed by patched 
Webalizer.
