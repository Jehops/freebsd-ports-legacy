Myghty is a Python based templating framework originally based on
HTML::Mason, the enterprise-level framework used by Amazon.com,
del.icio.us and Salon.com, among many others. Myghty fully implements
Mason's templating language, component-based architecture, and caching
system, and goes beyond, adding new paradigms such as Module
Components, full Python whitespace syntax, threading support, WSGI
support, session support, and much more.
