1) Create a user and a database for MAHARA to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.

   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAHARADIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny

3) Make sure that magic_quotes_gpc is off and register_globals is off 
in your PHP.ini file.

4) Change into the directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAHARADIR%% and copy the 
file config-dist.php to config.php, then go through the file and make
