POST-INSTALLATION NOTES:

Before you can use NanoBlogger, you will have to create a global configuration file
to set defaults information and paths to template files.

A sample configuration file has been installed in:
 %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf.sample

Since there are already some sensible default settings, you can begin with:
 cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf.sample %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf
