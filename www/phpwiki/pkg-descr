A WikiWikiWeb is a web site where anyone can edit the pages through
an HTML form. Linking is done automatically on the server side; all
pages are stored in a database.

This may sound rather simplistic, but a Wiki is a very unique way
to collaborate on the Web.

The addictive quality of a Wiki is that making pages is as simple
as making a link to them. If they don't yet exist, the page link
will be followed by a hyperlinked question mark; follow that link
and you can define the new page.

With this setup, you can update and create pages from anywhere
there is a web browser handy.
