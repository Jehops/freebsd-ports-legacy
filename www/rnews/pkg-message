===============================================================
Rnews is now installed. You may have to follow this steps to
make it work correctly.

1: edit rnews_config.php to suit your site's configuration
2: create a database with the name you gave in rnews_config.inc
   $ mysql -u root
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE rnews_db;
   mysql> quit
3: go to http://your.site/some/dir/rnews/
   by default, the DocumentRoot variable of your httpd.conf
   must be "%%PREFIX%%/www/"

If the configuration was done correctly, and php is able to 
connect to the mysql server, you should be able to create a new
account and start adding rss sources!
