pRuby is a glue code between PHP and Ruby which lets you use Ruby as a
HTML-embedded, server side scripting language.  With pRuby, you can
intermix PHP and Ruby to create dynamic web content.  For example, you
can call PHP's database and image drawing functions from Ruby and vice
versa.  pRuby is often compared to PHP, mod_ruby, eRuby, Erb, mod_perl
and ASP.  Key features: better startup speed than CGI and PHP, better
execution speed than PHP, more powerful and less messier to program
than PHP, cross-language function calls and cross-language error
handling.
