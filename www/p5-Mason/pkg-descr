Mason is a powerful Perl-based templating system, designed to generate dynamic
 content of all kinds.

Unlike many templating systems, Mason does not attempt to invent an alternate,
"easier" syntax for templates. It provides a set of syntax and features specific
to template creation, but underneath it is still clearly and proudly
recognizable as Perl.

Mason is most often used for generating web pages. It can handle web requests
directly via PSGI, or act as the view layer for a web framework such as
Catalyst or Dancer.
