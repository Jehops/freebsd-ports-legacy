+ # you want, but "bric" is typical. POSTGRES_DB is the name of the database 
+ # Bricolage will use.
+ #
+ # In most installations, Postgres allows local users to access the
+ # server without a username.  If your server requires a password, pass the
+ # POSTGRES_SUPERPASS environment variable during "make," e.g.:
+ #
+ #    make POSTGRES_SUPERPASS=abcdef
+ #
+ # The Bricolage Postgres Password (the password used by Bricolage to
+ # connect to the database) is randomly generated during a silent install.  If
+ # you need it, it'll be in bricolage.conf after installation.
+ #
+ # If PostgreSQL is running on a separate box, you must pass a host name or 
+ # IP address to "make" through the POSTGRES_HOSTNAME environment variable.
+ # If it's running on a port other than the default port (5432), pass the 
+ # appropriate port number with POSTGRES_HOSTPORT.
