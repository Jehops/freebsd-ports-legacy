  You have to ensure that you have a database server (or ODBC access to a
  remote database) installed and configured, and you have to ensure that 
  your PHP installation has been compiled with support for your database or
  database access method.

  To configure phpMyFAQ point your browser to
	http://localhost/%%PHPMYFAQURL%%/install/index.php
	http://localhost/%%PHPMYFAQURL%%/admin/index.php

  for your first login into the admin section.

  you MUST delete the following files manually for security purposes 
  from %%PHPMYFAQDIR%%:
