The BSDI FrontPage Extentions require that libcrypt.* be linked to the
libdescrypt.* libraries.  The fpsrvadm.exe program can only create DES
passwords, but the Apache server is unable to use them when libcrypt.* 
are linked to the libscrypt.* libraries.

For this port to be usefull you need to install an Apache-Frontpage
enabled web server.  Only the following ports/packages qualifies:

Ports:
    www/apache13-fp     >=1.3.20_1

Packages:
    apache_fp           >=1.3.20_1
