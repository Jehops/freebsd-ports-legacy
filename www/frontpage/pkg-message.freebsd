The FreeBSD FrontPage Extentions require that libcrypt.* be linked to the
libdescrypt.* libraries.  This is due to a problem with the fpsrvadm.exe
program will create invaild MD5 passwords when libcrypt.* are linked to
the libscrypt.* libraries.

For this port to be usefull you need to install an Apache-Frontpage
enabled web server.  Only the following ports/packages qualifies:

Ports:
    www/apache13-fp	>=1.3.20_1
