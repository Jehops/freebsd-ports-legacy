Searches e-mail archives created by Earl Hood's MHonArc.  Search
options include "From," "Subject," "Date," and "Message Body."
Returns results in a visually useful format, with matches printed
in bold. Search terms can be treated as a literal phrase or as
words to be joined by 'AND' or 'OR' booleans. The full suite of
Perl5 regular expressions is allowed.  Allows user to set a limit
for the number of records to return on each page, with an option
to continue the search or start a new one. NOTE: searches are
non-indexed and therefore inefficient.
