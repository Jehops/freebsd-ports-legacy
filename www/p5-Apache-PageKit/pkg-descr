PageKit is a web applications framework that is based on mod_perl.
This framework is distinguished from others such as Embperl and Mason
by providing a clear separation of programming, content and
presentation.

It does this by implementing a Model/View/Content/Controller (MVCC)
design paradigm:
    - Model is user supplied Perl Classes
    - View is set of PageKit Templates and/or XSLT files
    - Content is set of XML Files
    - Controller is PageKit

This allows your programmers, designers and content editors to work
independently with clean well-defined interfaces.

PageKit provides the following features:
    - Component-based architecture
    - Language Localization and charset translation
    - Session Management
    - Input Validation
    - Sticky HTML Forms
    - Authentication
    - Co-branding and XML,WML, and PDF output
    - Automatic Dispatching of URIs
    - Easy Error Handling
