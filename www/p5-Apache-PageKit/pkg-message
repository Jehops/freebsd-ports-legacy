The Apache PageKit uses a newer expat library (textproc/expat2) for parsing
XML and XSLT documents.  This causes a conflict with the builtin expat
library.  You may need to recompile the Apache port without support for the
builtin expat library.  To verify if you need to recompile Apache, run the
following command.

    strings `which httpd` | grep XML

If anything outputs to the console, you need to recompile Apache.  You can
disable the builtin expat library by passing "--disable-rule=EXPAT" to
configure.
