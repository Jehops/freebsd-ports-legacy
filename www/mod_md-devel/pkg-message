/!\ This is an early experience non-production-ready version /!\

This module requires a patched Apache mod_ssl. Apply the mod_ssl patch
from https://github.com/icing/mod_md/tree/master/patches to the
www/apache24 port and rebuild/reinstall apache.

If you want to have the md module enabled in your apache installation,
you need to add

   LoadModule md_module modules/mod_md.so

somewhere in your config files and add a line like

   ManagedDomain your_domain.example.org www.your_domain.example.org
