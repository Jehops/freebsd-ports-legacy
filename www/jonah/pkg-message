Jonah has been installed in %%JONAHDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see:
- %%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde2/pkg-message

Then, you may have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the files conf.php.
Check in %%PREFIX%%/www/horde/config/horde.php that 'admin' is
treated as an administrator.

Finally, beeing root, you must run %%PREFIX%%/bin/cli-backend.php
to fetch the headlines. You might add an entry in your crontab to
refresh them (hourly, for example).

Then go to <URL:http://localhost/horde/>; and click on the newspaper
to see the channels.

There is a test script at <URL:http://localhost/horde/jonah/test.php>;.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
