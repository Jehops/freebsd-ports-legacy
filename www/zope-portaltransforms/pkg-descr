This Zope product provides two new tools for the CMF in order to make MIME
types based transformations on the portal contents, and so an easy to way to
plugin some new transformations for previously unsupported content types. The
provided tools are :
                                                                                
 * mimetypes_registry (the mimetypes tool) : handle mime types information
                                                                                
 * portal_transform (the transform tool) : handle transformation of data from a
 mime type to another
