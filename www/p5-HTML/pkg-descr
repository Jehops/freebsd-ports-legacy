HTML::Base is an expansion module for PERL version 5 which
provides an object-oriented way to build pages of HTML.
It's purpose is to create HTML tags at the lowest level of
functionality, that is to say, it creates HTML and doesn't
do much else.  Specifically, it does not provide any
CGI-like services (see the CGI modules for that!).

Currently, the module supports all of the standard HTML
2.0 tags, plus some selected tags from the proposed HTML
3.0 standard, and some NetScapeisms.
