The Preferential project aims to provide a comprehensive resource
for finding Mozilla preference documentation. It is also a popular
Mozilla extension that provides all Gecko-based products (eg.
Mozilla Suite, Firefox & Thunderbird) with a simple, accessible
GUI to use when browsing and modifying preferences set within that
product.
