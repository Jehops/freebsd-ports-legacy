This module will allow Drupal to replace textarea fields with the CKEditor -
a visual HTML editor, sometimes called WYSIWYG editor.
This HTML text editor brings many of the powerful WYSIWYG editing functions
of known desktop editors like Word to the web. It's very fast and doesn't
require any kind of installation on the client computer.
