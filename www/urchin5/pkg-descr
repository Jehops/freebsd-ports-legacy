Urchin is a web analytics software product that, in basic terms, reads log
files and produces usage reports.  Urchin uses Adobe's SVG graphics
technology to generate gorgeous, quick-rendering, interactive graphs that
can be easily pasted into common Office applications.  Urchin achieves a
high level of accuracy and captures a wealth of visitor parameters via the
Urchin Traffic Monitor (UTM), a client-side data collection component that
transparently sends additional data back to the server and into the log
file.  The UTM uses a first-party cookie to overcome the effects of caches,
proxies, and IP-recycling to provide the most accurate and complete
reporting available from ANY analytics solution.
