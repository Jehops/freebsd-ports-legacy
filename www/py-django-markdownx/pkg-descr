Django Markdownx is a Markdown editor built for Django. It enables raw
editing, live preview and image uploads (stored locally in MEDIA folder) with
drag&drop functionality and auto tag insertion. Also, django-markdownx
supports multiple editors on one page.

Template is highly customizable, so you can easily use i.e. Bootstrap to
layout editor pane and preview pane side by side (as in preview animation
below).
