The ZNavigator product was designed to simplify the construction of
navigation bars. It was written to make navbar management easy for
inexperienced contents managers, and provide some nifty features.

Many of the features and their usage are demonstrated in the
navigator_demo package, which you can import with the name
'navigator_demo.zexp' from the Zope management interface.
