This is the port of the Roxen Challenger http and ftp server.  It has
a configuration interface to be accessed with a web browser and comes with
some nice modules like automatic generation of graphical text.

It is written in Pike (version 0.6), a modern language derived from lpc.

If you want support for mysql in Roxen, make sure to install mysql
first.  This port will then notice the installed mysql.
