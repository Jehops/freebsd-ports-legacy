This is the port of the Roxen WebServer 2.1, a modular http and ftp
server.  The main features are:

- Web based configuration interface
- Support for inline PHP4 and Perl code
- Database access to any common DBMS
- Dynamic generation of graphical text and diagrams
- Simple documented API to quickly create own modules to extend features

If you want support for MySQL in Roxen, make sure to install MySQL
first.  This port will then take care of it.
