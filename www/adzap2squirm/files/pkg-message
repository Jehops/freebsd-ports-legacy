********************************************************
 In order to block ads, you must first setup squirm.conf
 An example is in:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/squirm/squirm.conf.zap

 You must also setup squid to use squirm if you have not
 done so. Add this to %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf:

	redirect_program: %%PREFIX%%/bin/squirm

 Then run from the command line:

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/update-zapper

This port installs a script (%%PREFIX%%/update-zapper)
which will update the ad definitions, and restart squid
if there are new ones available.  Add this to root's
crontab to easily keep your ad definitions up to date.
