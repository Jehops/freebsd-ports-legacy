This is the current release of the Mozilla open source web browser. It should 
be fully compliant with all W3C standards, including HTML, CSS, XML, XSL, 
JavaScript, MathML, SVG and RDF.  This version also supports SSL encryption, 
and Java with the use of the FreeBSD native Java plug-in.

This version is described by mozilla.org as a "bleeding edge release" which
incoporates changes that occurred after the Mozilla 1.0 branch.

Testers are most welcome, but should submit bug reports about
the browser itself to mozilla.org (http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)
rather than via FreeBSD.
