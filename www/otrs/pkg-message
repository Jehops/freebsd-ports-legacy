Additional configuration is necessary before you can use OTRS. To configure
Apache to use OTRS, add the following to your Apache configuration:

.<Directory %%OTRSHOME%%/bin/cgi-bin/>
.    Options ExecCGI
.    AddHandler cgi-script .pl
.    Order allow,deny
.    Allow from all
.</Directory>
.<Directory %%OTRSHOME%%/var/httpd/htdocs/>
.    Order allow,deny
.    Allow from all
.</Directory>
.Alias /otrs-web/ "%%OTRSHOME%%/var/httpd/htdocs/"
.ScriptAlias /otrs/ "%%OTRSHOME%%/bin/cgi-bin/"

After reloading Apache, you should be able to set up OTRS further by going to
http://yourdomain.tld/otrs/installer.pl

See also %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL for additional info about setting up the OTRS
database, cron jobs, email, etc. NB: The included documentation assumes OTRS is
installed in /opt/otrs, but it is installed in %%OTRSHOME%% by this port.
