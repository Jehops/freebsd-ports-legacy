smb:// issues (Gvfs/GIO or GNOMEVFS2 option):
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

sftp:// (Gvfs/GIO or GNOMEVFS2 option):
Only sftp access using public key authentication works.  To easily
setup public key authentication to "remote_host":

ssh-keygen -t dsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on remote_host must allow pub key authentication.

Firefox and HTML5

H.264 or MP3 playback may fail due to ffmpeg/libav bug with one of
the following messages on the terminal

  (gst-plugin-scanner:13877): GStreamer-WARNING **: Failed to load plugin '/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libgstffmpeg.so': /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libgstffmpeg.so: Undefined symbol "ff_mlp_init_x86"
  (gst-plugin-scanner:42518): GStreamer-WARNING **: Failed to load plugin '/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libgstffmpeg.so': /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libgstffmpeg.so: Undefined symbol "ff_deinterlace_line_mmx"

If you happen to be affected please apply the fix in ports/181964 and
rebuild the ports.

Also, certain functions used to display HTML5 elements need the sem(4)
module but only on 8.x releases (or before r201546).

If your Firefox crashes with the following message while viewing a
HTML5 page:
"Bad system call (core dumped)"

you need to load the sem module (kldload sem).

To load sem on every boot put the following into your
/boot/loader.conf:
sem_load="YES"
