You now need to create the DB where Drupal is going to live

 PostgreSQL::
   createdb -U pgsql -W drupal
   createuser -U pgsql -P -e drupal
   createlang -U pgsql -W plpgsql drupal
   psql -U drupal drupal < %%DRUPAL_DIR%%/database/database.pgsql

 MySQL::
   mysqladmin -u dba_user -p create drupal
   mysql -u dba_user -p
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO drupal@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'passwd';
   mysql -u drupal -p drupal < %%DRUPAL_DIR%%/database/database.mysql"

Then edit the %%DRUPAL_DIR%%/sites/default/settings.php
to your needs.  Once you have done that you must add appropriate
configuration directives to your apache configuration file
(%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache(2)/httpd.conf).  A typical configuration would be:

    Alias /drupal "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%"

    <Directory "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%">
        Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
