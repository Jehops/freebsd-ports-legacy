Please note that if you intend to run Cherokee as www user,
you'll have to manually create the log files and set the
proper ownership and permissions on them.

You can do it with (as root):

  touch /var/log/cherokee.error /var/log/cherokee.access
  chown -v www:www /var/log/cherokee.*
  chmod -v 0640 /var/log/cherokee.*

If you run Cherokee as root (NOT recommended) this is not
necessary.

To run Cherokee at startup or using the rc script, add
'cherokee_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf

To start the Cherokee administrative interface, run (as root)

  cherokee-admin

For more information on cherokee-admin(1), please refer to
the official documentation and manpage.
