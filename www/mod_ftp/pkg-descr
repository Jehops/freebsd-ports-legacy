mod_ftp is a FTP Protocol module to serve httpd content over the
FTP protocol (whereever the HTTP protocol could also be used). It
provides both RETR/REST retrieval and STOR/APPE upload, using the
same user/permissions model as httpd (so it shares the same security
considerations as mod_dav plus mod_dav_fs).
