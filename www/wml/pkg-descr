  WML -- Website META Language

  Version 1.1.0 (19-08-1997)

  WML is a HTML generation toolkit consisting of 9 independent languages.  The
  main idea of WML is a sequential filtering scheme where each language
  provides one of 9 processing passes. So WML reads an input file, applies
  passes 1-9 (or optionally only the passes specified) and finally produces
  one or more output files. It operates as a powerful offline HTML generation
  toolkit for webmasters. While not trivial and idiot proof it provides most
  of the features real hackers always wanted for HTML generation.
