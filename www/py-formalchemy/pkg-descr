Introduction
============

FormAlchemy greatly speeds development with SQLAlchemy mapped classes
(models) in a HTML forms environment.

FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields
from a given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of
HTML code should be returned by introspecting the model's properties
and generate ready-to-use HTML code that will fit the developer's
application.

Of course, FormAlchemy can't figure out everything, i.e, the developer
might want to display only a few columns from the given model. Thus,
FormAlchemy is also highly customizable.

Features
========

- Generates HTML form fields and tables from SQLAlchemy mapped classes
  or manually added Fields
- Works with declarative or classic mapper definitions
- Render and edits single objects or collections (grids)
- Handles object relationships (including many-to-many), not just
  simple data types
- Synonym support
- Composite and custom type support
- Supports all composite primary keys and most CFKs
- Pre-fills input fields with current or default value
- Highly customizable HTML output
- Validates input and displays errors in-line
- Syncs model instances with input data
- Easy-to-use, extensible API
- SQLAlchemy 0.4 (0.4.5 or later) and 0.5 compatible


Limitations
===========

- Currently, only handles composite foreign keys of primitive Python
  types
