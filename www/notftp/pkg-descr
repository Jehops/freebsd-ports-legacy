NotFTP is a fully featured and easy to use Web to FTP gateway written in
PHP. It supports all common FTP functions (including uploads and SSL-FTP)
and allows the administrator to set a maximum transfer size and a daily
transfer quota for users. It is particularly well-suited for making FTP
accessible to users behind an HTTP-only proxy. In addition, it will
usually work right out of the box with no configuration.
