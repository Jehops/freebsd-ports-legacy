This is the BSDI BSD/OS version of the Netscape Communicator suite
(Navigator Web browser, Messenger MUA and news reader, and Composer
HTML editor) with strong encryption.  Unlike the FreeBSD version,
this does not require a.out X libraries (because it is statically
linked).  This browser is under U.S. export restrictions.  Do "make
pre-fetch" to determine whether you may download it.

If Java applets fail to display, do this as root:
	cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
	/usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir
	chmod 444 fonts.dir
then exit and restart your X server.
