MimeDetect provides an API for consistent server side mime detection
using the PHP FileInfo extension, the UNIX 'file' command, user supplied
mime data, or file extension lookups. It is distributed with it's own
magic library for use with the PHP FileInfo extension to make mime
detection more consistent in different environments.
