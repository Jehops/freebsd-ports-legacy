TO YOU.  THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN IS THE ONLY WARRANTY
MADE TO YOU AND IS PROVIDED IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTIES (IF
ANY) CREATED BY ANY DOCUMENTATION, PACKAGING OR OTHERWISE.  THIS
LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO
HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY BY JURISDICTION.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT USE OF THE DEVELOPER SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY
AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY ON MEDIA
SET FORTH ABOVE AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, THE DEVELOPER SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSORS
(COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS APPLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 6
AND 7) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT

YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE DEVELOPER SOFTWARE
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE DEVELOPER
SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE
GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE
A WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE DEVELOPER SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A

YOU.

OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE

OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS
