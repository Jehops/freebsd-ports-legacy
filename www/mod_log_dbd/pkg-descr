mod_log_dbd is an add-on module for the Apache web server that uses the APR DBD
framework to store access logs in a database. Any missing tables and columns
are automatically created if the module is given a database user with
sufficient privileges.

This module was designed for simplicity and therefore doesn't allow the
nearly-inifinite customization of other logging modules. For example,
column and table names are created automatically, which not only
simplifies configuration but improves performance as well.
