wwwstat: httpd logfile analysis package

Copyright (c) 1994, 1996 Regents of the University of California.

    wwwstat processes a sequence of httpd Common Logfile Format access_log
    files and prior summary outputs, and then outputs a summary of
    the access statistics in a nice HTML format.

    splitlog processes a sequence of httpd Common Logfile Format access_log
    files (or CLF with a one-field prefix) and splits the entries into
    separate files according to the requested URL and/or vhost prefix.
