Desktop aggregators are great. They sit there all day, pinging away at sites,
and as soon as they notice something new, they pop up little windows on your
desktop, and let you read items. But what about when you go home from work?
Or what about when you are on a trip? You get totally out of sync, and don't
know what you've read and haven't read. You are enraged.

Feed on Feeds A server side aggregator solves this. It keeps track of what
items you've read, and keeps happily checking up on your feeds no matter where
you are. Whenever you want to see what's new, you just bring up a web page and
scan the newest items. You can mark the items as read so they won't be shown
again. Or, you can just always show the most recent N items, like the way
LiveJournal's friends pages work. Also, having the aggregator in your browser
eliminates the "impedance mismatch" that sometimes occurs between a desktop
aggregator and your browser. All your native browsing methods work on a
FEED ON FEEDS page. Open pages in new tabs, bookmark them for later, browse
whatever way you like.
