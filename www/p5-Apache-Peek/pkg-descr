Apache::Peek is a data debugging tool for the XS programmer (under
mod_perl).

Apache::Peek is a sub-class of Devel::Peek.  The only difference is that
it overrides the stderr stream, to which Devel::Peek sends its output,
and send the output to the client instead.

Apache::Peek works both with mod_perl 1.0 and 2.0.
