LifeType is a PHP and MySQL based blogging platform and its main goals 
are flexibility and extendibility. It uses a powerful template system
based on the Smarty template engine to render the templates, whick 
makes the platform highly customizable and safer to let other people 
customize the templates, since the presentation code is isolated from
the PHP code.
