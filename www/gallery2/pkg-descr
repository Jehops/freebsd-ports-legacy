Gallery is a slick web based photo album written using PHP. Easy to install
(it includes a config wizard), it provides users with the ability to create
and maintain their own albums in the album collection via an intuitive web
interface. Photo management includes automatic thumbnail creation, image
resizing, rotation, ordering, captioning, searching and more. Albums can
have read, write and caption permissions per individual authenticated user
for an additional level of privacy.
