CMFActionIcons

This product is a add-on for the Zope Content Management Framework (CMF). It
should be useful with Plone, CPS, and other CMF-derived extensions, as well.
The product provides:

*    A new tool, portal_actionicons, which serves as a registry mapping object
     actions (using category and action ID) to a descriptive title, a priority,
     and an icon ID. The tool post-processes a set of actions (i.e., those
     generated by the portal_actions tool), decorating them with additional
     information, and sorting them according to priority.  
     
*    ZPT macros which build either horizontal or vertical icon bars for a set
     of actions.
