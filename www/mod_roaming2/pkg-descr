mod_roaming is an Apache module that works as a Netscape Roaming
Access server for Netscape Communicator 4.5 or later.

This allows you to store your Netscape Communicator 4.5 preferences,
bookmarks, address books, cookies etc.  on the server so that you can
use (and update) the same settings from any Netscape Communicator 4.5
that can access the server.
