************************************************************
Please edit your Apache configuration file to enable and set
up this module.  You may also need to create an htpasswd
file if you are going to use basic authentication.

Look at the file ${PREFIX}/etc/apache/httpd.conf.mod_roaming
and the documents held in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_roaming/
for indications on what to do.

(${PREFIX} is typically /usr/local)

When it's all set up, do the following to take effect:

  apachectl configtest	(and correct any errors reported)
  apachectl restart

Enjoy!
