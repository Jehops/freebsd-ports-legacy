KDE Dictionary is used by a few KDE i18n teams.
Kdedict is written by Matthias Kiefer from German team
and i18n.kde.org's instalaltion is currently administered by Claudiu Costin
from Romaninan Team.
Kdedict is a web based database to administer the standard translations of a
translation team. You can search the database for different criterias and the
found entries are shown in a table.
Kdedict does not use a full blown database but stores the information in a
plain text file. This way, everybody can easily run kdedict offline (using a
local web server) without having to install and admin a big database. To enable
users to update their locale database easily, kdedict offers a download option.
But if you have basic knowledge of Perl, it should be no problem to adapt
dedict for using a real database.
The database consists of the fields: original text, description, translation,
description, category of the word (i.e. GUI, Network), date of last update and
flag, if the translation is accepted by the team. This flag allows you to
include translations, that your team is not in agreement about, into the
database.
Kdedict is able to manage user logins, so you can easily maintain your database
over the web. When logged in, it is easy to edit, insert or delete entries.
Kdedict can also manage multiple languages, by creating one table for each
user.
