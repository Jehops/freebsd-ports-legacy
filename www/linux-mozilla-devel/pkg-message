This is a beta version.  It would be a good
idea to back up any important bookmark files.

Settings in users' ~/.mozilla/ from an older
Mozilla may not work.  In that case, remove the
old files and make fresh ones.

After installing new plugins within (Linux) Netscape, run
PREFIX/lib/linux-mozilla/linkfarm
each time as root to make them available to linux-mozilla.
