*********************************************************************
Sharing a profile (found in users' ~/.mozilla/) with an older Mozilla
or with Netscape 7 may cause loss of the data in the profile, or
other ill effects.  Users are urged to back up the contents of
~/.mozilla/ and to make separate profiles if they wish to attempt
this.

After installing new plugins within (Linux) Netscape 7 or Beonex, run
PREFIX/lib/linux-mozilla/linkfarm
each time as root to make them available to linux-mozilla.
