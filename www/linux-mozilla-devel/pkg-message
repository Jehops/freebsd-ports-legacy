*********************************************************************
Settings in users' ~/.mozilla/ from an older Mozilla may not work.
In that case, remove the old files and make fresh ones.  There is
a chance that running Netscape 6 or 7 may damage settings or bookmark
files made in Mozilla, and vice versa.  Users should back them up
before attempting this.

After installing new plugins within (Linux) Netscape, run
PREFIX/lib/linux-mozilla/linkfarm
each time as root to make them available to linux-mozilla.
