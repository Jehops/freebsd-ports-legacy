This is the unstable version of the Mozilla suite (Web browser,
HTML editor, mail user agent, news reader, and address book)
pre-compiled for Linux.  The Linux version is necessary for running
plugins which are only available as Linux binaries.

The Chatzilla IRC client is not installed by this port, due to a
security bug.

This port is compatible with the www/linuxflashplugin port and with
the Flash and Java plugins from the www/netscape7 port.
