This is the Mozilla suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail user
agent, news reader, and address book) pre-compiled for Linux.  The
Linux version is necessary for running plugins which are only
available as Linux binaries.

The Chatzilla IRC client is not installed by this port, due to a
security bug.

This port is compatible with the www/linuxflashplugin port and with
the Flash and Java plugins from the www/linux-netscape6 port.

For the maintainer, the Java plugin from Netscape 6 does not work
when linux_base-7 is installed, but does work under linux_base-61
or linux_base-62.  Your mileage may vary.
