Multiprotocol Web Services for TurboGears

TGWebServices provides a super simple API for creating web services
that are available via SOAP, HTTP->XML, and HTTP->JSON.
The SOAP API generates WSDL automatically for your Python and even
generates enough type information for statically typed languages
(Java and C#, for example) to generate good client code on their end.
