To setup the database, run the following command as the statistics
user (generally "squid") :

# su -m squid -c "%%PREFIX%%/bin/squidstats.pl createdb"

Then, add a configuration section to squid.conf to allow SNMP from
localhost:

# snmp config
acl snmp_host src 127.0.0.1
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0
snmp_port 3401
acl snmppublic snmp_community public
snmp_access allow snmppublic snmp_host
snmp_access deny all

Then make sure the following line is added to the squid crontab:
*/5 * * * * 	%%PREFIX%%/bin/squidstats.pl gather 2>/dev/null

Next, the supplied graph.css file will need to be copied or
symlinked from %%PREFIX%%/share/squidstats/htdocs/graph.css
to wherever your webserver root is.

Finally, you will need to ensure that the graph directory and
cgi-bin script are in the right place. By default, the cgi script
is installed in %%PREFIX%%/www/cgi-bin/ and the graph directory
is in /var/db/squidstats/graphs; you will need to copy the graph
script into the correct place and symlink the graph directory
into your webserver root directory.

For example, this will symlink the graph directory into the
apache 1.x web root:

# ln -s /var/db/squidstats/graphs /usr/local/www/data/
