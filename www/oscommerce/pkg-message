Congratulations!  You have installed osCommerce.  You are one step closer to
having a functional e-commerce website.  You should now open a browser and go
to:

        http://localhost/oscommerce/catalog/install/

Once you've finished the rest of the installation, it is highly encouraged 
that you 

        chmod -R 000 %%OSCOMMERCE%%/catalog/install

to disable the installation utilities.

The administrative interface can be found at

        http://localhost/oscommerce/catalog/admin/

and should have its access appropriately restricted to prevent someone 
from modifying parts of your catalog.
