You now need to create a WWW alias in your web server configuration to allow
the Drupal module to use the TinyMCE code.  For Apache based systems, the
following directive will work:

    Alias %%TINYMCE_MODDIR%% %%TINYMCEDIR%%

Please see the TinyMCE Wiki for more information on how to get the most out
of this package:
