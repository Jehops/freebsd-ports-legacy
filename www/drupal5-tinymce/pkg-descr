TinyMCE is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG editor
control released as Open Source under LGPL by Moxiecode Systems AB. It has
the ability to convert HTML TEXTAREA fields or other HTML elements to editor
instances. TinyMCE is very easy to integrate into other Content Management
Systems.

This module integrates the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor into a Drupal site for
editing advanced site content.
