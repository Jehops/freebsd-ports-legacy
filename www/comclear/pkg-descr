From the ComClear README:

"ComClear is a history cleaner for Netscape Navigator and Communicator.  It 
 allows a user to choose from deleting the cache, cookies, history and 
 drop-down list.

 Comclear has both a command-line version and a GTK+ version, the latter of 
 which is run automatically when comclear is run from an X session."
