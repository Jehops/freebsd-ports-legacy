This program displays and prints Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.  It also allows you to search for text in a PDF file, or in
all the PDF files in a directory.

This is the Simplified Chinese version.  It also has support for
the English language.  To configure the language, navigate to
Edit->Preferences->International->Application Language, set it to
"Choose at application startup" and restart the program.

After installation, use the "acroread7-zh_CN" command to run it.

If fonts in the menus are displayed incorrectly (each character
looks like three sides of a square), try setting the environment
variable GDK_USE_XFT=0 before running the program, for example like:
"GDK_USE_XFT=0 acroread7-zh_CN".
