Hanzi Master ("hanzim") is a Chinese character learning-aid program.

It is designed to help you memorize characters by leading you to internalize
their various systematicities. It displays lists of characters with the same
radicals, same remaining parts, and same pronunciations, along with pinyin
pronunciations and lists of compounds.
