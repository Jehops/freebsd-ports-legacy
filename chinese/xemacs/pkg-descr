See /usr/ports/editors/xemacs20/pkg/DESCR for details. :)

This port adds XIM support to XEmacs, thus you can use X input server
like xcin to input Chinese. It also comes with Chinese Big5 settings,
including Big5-localized menus and buffer-file support.

The Big5-localized menus are contributed by
