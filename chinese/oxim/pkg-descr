oxim is a common input method server, which focuses mainly on Chinese.
It is mainly developed by Firefly <firefly@ossii.com.tw>, and is a
fork from xcin 2.5.3 (pre-release version). In addition to the
original Root and OverTheSpot input style inherited from xcin, it
also supports OnTheSpot and OnTheSpotQT. You can easily use oxim in
GTK and QT based software.
