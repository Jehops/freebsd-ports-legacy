 hztty
 
 This program turns a tty session from one encoding to another.
 For example, running hztty on cxterm can allow you to read/write
 Chinese in HZ format, which was not supported by cxterm.
 If you have many applications in different encodings but your
 favorite terminal program only supports one, hztty can make life easy.
 For example, hztty can your GB cxterm into a HZ terminal, a
 Unicode (16bit, or UTF8, or UTF7) terminal, or a Big5 terminal.
 
 The idea is to open a new shell session on top of the current one
 and to translate the encoding between the new tty and the orignal.
 For example, if your application uses encoding A and your terminal
 supports encoding B, hztty catches the output of the application
 and converts them from A to B before sending to the terminal.
 Similarly, hztty converts all the terminal input from B to A before
 sending to the application.
