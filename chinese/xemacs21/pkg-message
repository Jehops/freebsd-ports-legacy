Now you have installed zh-XEmacs, do the following:
cp /usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.1.14/etc/app-defaults/zh_TW.Big5/Emacs ~/Emacs
cp /usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.1.14/etc/app-defaults/zh_TW.Big5/sample.emacs ~/.emacs

To use XIM, run any input method like oxim/gcin/scim first, set BOTH LANG
and LC_CTYPE to zh_TW.Big5, then execute xemacs.  You should be able to
input Chinese now.
