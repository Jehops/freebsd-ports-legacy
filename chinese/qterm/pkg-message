	You can't modify the SITE definition until setting
QTerm's config file privilege in your ~/.qterm directory to 0755 at least
		To display IP location when using QTerm
you must get file "QQWry.dat" and put it into your ~/.qterm directory

Unfortunately there is an anonying bug in the release of QTerm 0.4.0. If 
your language setting is NOT English, you might experience some hang up 
when connecting to a site.

A simple workaround is to use the English interface. This bug will be fixed
in the next minor release.
