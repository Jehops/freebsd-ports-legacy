gbscript converts GB simplified Chinese text to PostScript.

Chinese bitmap fonts which are without 'zone gap' and 16x16 or 24x24 sized

	Some usable fonts are:
		Name           Description                 File Size
		[24x24]
		cclib.24       (Simplified SONG)           588,816
		cclibf.24      (Traditional SONG)          588,816
		cclibb.24      (Simplified FANGSONG)       588,816
		cclibk.24      (Simplified KAI)            588,816
		cclibh.24      (Simplified HEI)            588,816

		[16x16]
		ncclib.16      (Simplified)                267,712

NOTES:
o  cclib.j24, cclib.f24, cclib.k24, cclib.h24 and cclib.n24 are a different set
   of font files (although derived from same origins); they cannot be used with
   GBscript.
o  some fonts do not include zones for special symbols, to save disk space, thus
   they are not continuous in zone and there exist 'zone gaps'.  GBscript
   currently cannot handle this type of font.
o  Chinese bitmap fonts can be found in /ftp@ifcss.org:/software/fonts/
