gbscript converts GB simplified Chinese text to PostScript.

Chinese bitmap fonts, which are:
	o without 'zone gap', and
	o 16x16 or 24x24 sized

	Some usable fonts are:
		Name           Description                 File Size
		[24x24]
		cclib.24       (Simplified SONG)           588,816
		cclibf.24      (Traditional SONG)          588,816
		cclibb.24      (Simplified FANGSONG)       588,816
		cclibk.24      (Simplified KAI)            588,816
		cclibh.24      (Simplified HEI)            588,816

		[16x16]
		ncclib.16      (Simplified)                267,712

       NOTE:
        o  cclib.j24, cclib.f24,  cclib.k24,  cclib.h24  and cclib.n24
           are a different set of font  files (although  derived  from
           same origins); they cannot be used with GBscript.
        o  some  fonts do not include those zones for special  symbols
           (in order to  save some  disk  space), thus  they  are  not
           continuous  in zone and there  exist 'zone  gaps'. GBscript
           currently cannot handle this type of font.
