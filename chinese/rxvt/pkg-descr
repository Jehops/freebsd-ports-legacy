Rxvt is an xterm replacement which uses a little less memory, and is
suitable for use on machines with small memories.
The KANJI support was added to rxvt since 2.17, from 2.4.4(3?) the support
for Chinese BIG5 encoding is also added. 
Since 2.6PRE2, rxvt supports XIM. This port no longer patches for XCIN,
a Chinese input server. Instead, the user must install an input server which
support the XIM protocol. The user has to either patch XCIN (2.1, 2.3) or use
XCIN 2.5, which support XIM and only XIM protocol.
