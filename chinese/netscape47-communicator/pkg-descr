This port provides a Big5 localized Netscape, including menus,
toolbars, error messages and many others. It also contains a
libX11 fix, which allows Netscape to show Big5 buttons in html
documents.

The patches are mainly contributed by thhsieh@linux.org.tw &
hcchu@r350.ee.ntu.edu.tw. The localized Netscape.Big5 is
translated by Antony Shen <u8618806@cc.nctu.edu.tw>, with some
modifications.
