This is Wnn4.2, a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  It is
included primarily so that we can compile mule-2.1, a multilingual
emacs.

Only the Chinese version is build for this port.

Note that binaries and libraries go to /usr/local, while man pages and 
includes go to /usr/X11R6.  That's the way it was designed, I don't
know why.

This port is applied a patch for Xsi/jserver/b_index.c. This code is
only used in a Chinese method 'cWnn'. But you are not able to use
'Qianma' very well.

That bug is cuased by what cWnn has codes depend on architectures
about small-endian and big-endian machines.

If there are any problem in this patch, please know Mr. Ito via
E-mail.
