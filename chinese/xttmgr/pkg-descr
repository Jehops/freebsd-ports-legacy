A True Type Font Manager that handles true type font
installation, uninstallation, list, and default font
setting.  It was originally in the CLE distribution.

The manager doesn't deal with applications using TTF
directly.  Instead, it calls modules to handle the
details.  There are only several predefined behaviours
of the modules, like add/remove/list.  

Some modules are Big5/GB enhanced, for better font
detection/generation.
