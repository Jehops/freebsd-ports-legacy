===> Metalist post-port installation instructions:

  To complete the installation of this port, please perform following actions
  as root (the "virtual user" should be the same as p5-DBIx-Password):
  
  mysqladmin -u root create slash           # "slash" is your database name
  echo "Include %%LOCALBASE%%/slash/httpd/slash.conf" \
    >> %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/%%APACHE%%/httpd.conf     # or manually insert this line
  cd %%LOCALBASE%%/slash                       # change to the slash directory
  bin/install-slashsite -u slash       	    # "slash" is virtual user's name
  apachectl restart                         # restarts the apache server
  %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/slash.sh start        # start the "slashd" daemon
  
  Note that the "install-slashsite" script will ask you of a "theme";
  we recommend the CSS-based, fully internationalized "Elixss" theme.
  However, if your site uses Traditional Chinese only, the "metalist"
  theme will also do.
