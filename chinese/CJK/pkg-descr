Welcome to the CJK version 4.2.0 (13-Dec-1998), a LaTeX2e macro package
which enables the use of CJK scripts (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) in various
encodings.

=====
This port installs full Chinese BIG5 support, including TTF fonts. For
other Asian languages, you have to supply those TTF fonts, then manually
modify relative settings.
