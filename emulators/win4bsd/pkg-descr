Win4BSD is a PC emulator that runs Windows as a guest at nearly native
speed under FreeBSD.  It is based on QEMU, a partially open, partially
closed source emulator package.  However, Win4BSD offers many advantages,
including much greater speed, ease of use, more seamless integration with
the host OS, and "grabless" mouse transition between the host and Windows
guest.

Win4BSD is the latest port of a product that has previously been known as
Win4lin and SCO Merge.

This port downloads, extracts and installs the contents of the Win4BSD
package.  It will work with or without a Win4BSD license.  If you do not
have a license, Win4BSD will function for a 3 week trial period.
