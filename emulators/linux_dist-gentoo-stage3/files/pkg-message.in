* The port/package has attempted to enable Linux compatibility mode by loading
* the linux.ko kernel module.  You can load the module manually as root with the
* command "kldload linux" or have it load automatically at boot time by adding
* to /etc/rc.conf the line:
*
*   linux_enable="YES"
*
* You may wish to enable emulation of the Linux proc and sys filesystems.
* See the linprocfs(5) and linsysfs(5) man pages.
*
* To download Portage, do "chroot %%PREFIX%%/%%PREFIX_SUBDIR%% emerge --sync" as root.  Then you
* may want to do "chroot %%PREFIX%%/%%PREFIX_SUBDIR%% /usr/portage/scripts/bootstrap.sh" to
* rebuild binutils, gcc, gettext, and glibc.  See
* <URL:http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml> for more complete 
* instructions.
