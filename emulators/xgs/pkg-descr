This emulator does a great job of emulating an Apple IIGS. Various
IIGS hardware devices are also emulated but this version is still an
alpha quality release so you might find a few things missing.

XGS requires a copy of the IIGS ROM to boot up and this port should
attempt to FTP a copy of it from the Asimov archives (if it is still
available). If you have to obtain a copy of it manually then all you
should need to do is drop it in the xgs subdirectory of the distfiles
directory to allow the port to build. This ROM cannot be distributed
due to copyright reasons.

Please check out the files in /usr/local/share/doc/xgs (or equivalent
on your system). As this package has no man pages you will need to
pick up the basics from there. All author credits can be found in
these files also.

Share and enjoy,

Joel...
