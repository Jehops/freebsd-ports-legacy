This emulator does a good job of emulating an Apple IIGS. Various IIGS
hardware devices are also emulated (see README file) but this version
is still an alpha so you might find a few things missing.

XGS requires a copy of the IIGS ROM to boot up and this port should
attempt to FTP a copy of it from the Asimov archives (if it is still
available). If you have to obtain a copy of it manually then all you
should need to do is drop it in the distfiles directory to allow the
port to build. The md5 checksum file is specifically for the version 1
ROM so you may have to alter it should you decide to use a version 3
ROM. Also, this ROM cannot be distributed due to copyright reasons.

Please check out the README file in either the working directory or
/usr/local/share/xgs/ (or equivalent on your system). As this package
has no man pages you will need to pick up the basics from there. All
author credits can be found in these files also.

When loading disk images be sure to use the full path of the
file you're loading.
