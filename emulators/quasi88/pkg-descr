This is a PC-8801 emulator for X.
See http://www.117.ne.jp/~show/pc8801/pc88emu.html for further information.

Porters note:

After changes for activity of "-cpu 1" option on quasi88-0.3.1
(and later), some softwares gain the advantage of performance.

But some other softwares have become failed to work. It's worth
trying quasi88-0.3.0 if you are in that case after update to
newer version. The md5 for quasi88-0.3.0 is also in files/md5.
