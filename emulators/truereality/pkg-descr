TrueReality (TR) is a Nintendo N64(tm) emulator developed by 
Niki W. Waibel <niki.waibel@gmx.net> mainly for learning purposes.

From TR.FAQ:

Anyway - I think that TR does not run commercial ROMs - there is too much
stuff missing (I've not tested it - I just have heard nothing about that).

What is TR for if it is not for playing commercial ROMs?
A: 1) TR should be a tool for demo writers.
   2) TR should be an open emu project where everyone can learn from it.
   3) TR should be an example (one time) for implementing/learning asm under
     various machines.
     If someones hacks out iP-MMX routines you can compare it with the C ones
     and learn how things are done with MMX.

Where can I get ROMs?
A: There are demos at http://www.dextrose.com.
