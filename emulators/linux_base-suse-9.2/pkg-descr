This port contains packages from a near-minimal installation of Red Hat Linux
8.0.  These packages, in conjunction with the linux module, form the basis of
the Linux compatibility environment.

This port is only available for the i386 architecture.  If you use an Alpha
computer, please install the linux_base port instead of this one.
