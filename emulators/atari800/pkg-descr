You've found David Firth's Atari 800 emulator which can emulate the
8-bit Atari 800 and XL series of home computers. 

Please refer to /usr/local/share/doc/atari (or equivalent on your
system) for the distribution documents. A man page has also been
installed. The system wide configuration file can be found at
/usr/local/lib/atari/atari800.cfg (or similar) which you will probably
want to copy to your home directory, at some stage, to personalise the
settings.

If you're at all serious about your emulator then you SHOULD check out
these URL's in the order they're written:

  http://www.signus.demon.co.uk/david/
  http://zippy.sonoma.edu/~kendrick/nbs/new_and_emu.html
  ftp://ftp.hackerz.com/hackerz/atari/web/index.html
  comp.sys.atari.8bit

This should get you started and provide you with numerous links to
other web sites. 

The ROM's for the Atari computers are, unfortunately, copyright. This
port will attempt to down-load another freeware Atari emulator for DOS
called PC Xformer 2.5 which contains copies of these ROM files. If you
would like to take a further look at XF2.5 you should find it in your
distfiles directory (if it successfully down-loaded :->). For more info
on this emulator check out "http://www.halcyon.com/brasoft/".

If you have any general Atari questions then you might get a more
fruitful response by posting them to the news group, as the emulation
and questions mailing list won't be up-to-date with all things
Atari. However the FreeBSD emulation mailing list is dedicated to
discussing the emulation of other O/S's so don't be shy. Please check
Section 25 of the handbook for information on the mailing lists.

Share and enjoy,

Joel...
