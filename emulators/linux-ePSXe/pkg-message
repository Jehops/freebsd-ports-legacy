You should now log into your normal user account and issue a

	linux-epsxe_install

in order to create and populate ~/.ePSXe, needed to run the program.

To do anything useful with the emulator, you'll need a GPU and a SPU
plugin (the Ports Collection contains a number of those), and a
Playstation BIOS image. From the port's documentation:

	"During testing we found out that the scph1001.bin and
	 scph7502.bin BIOS are compatible, but the scph1000.bin
	 won't work."

Note that you may only be in possession of the copyrighted BIOS if
you're legally entitled to do so.

When you install a PSEmu Pro plugin from a FreeBSD port or package,
you should re-run

	linux-epsxe_install

in order to make the plugin available to ePSXe.
