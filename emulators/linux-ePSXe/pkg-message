To do anything useful with the emulator, you need:

  - a GPU (graphical processing unit) plugin, choose between:

      emulators/linux-peops-softgpu
      emulators/linux-pete-xgl2gpu
      emulators/linux-pete-mesagpu

  - a SPU (sound processing unit) plugin:

      emulators/linux-peops-spu

  - a Playstation BIOS image:

      The port documentation says: "during testing we found out that the
      scph1001.bin and scph7502.bin BIOS are compatible, but the scph1000.bin
      won't work".

      Please keep in mind that the Playstation BIOS is copyrighted software.
