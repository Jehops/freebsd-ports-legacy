GXemul is a free instruction-level machine emulator, emulating not only the
CPU, but also other hardware components, making it possible to use the emulator
to run unmodified operating systems such as NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux.

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types are
emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

  * DECstation 5000/200 ("3max"): serial controller (including keyboard and
    mouse), ethernet, SCSI, and graphical framebuffers.
  * Acer Pica-61 (an ARC machine): serial controller, "VGA" text console, and
    SCSI.
  * NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, and 880 (HPCmips machines): framebuffer,
    keyboard, and a PCMCIA IDE controller.
  * Cobalt: serial controller and PCI IDE.
