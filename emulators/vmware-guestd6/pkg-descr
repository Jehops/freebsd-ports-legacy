vmware-guestd daemon is for time synchronization with host OS and others.
Beware, this port is for FreeBSD _guest_ OS.  You don't need to install
this ports to FreeBSD _host_ OS.

If you want to run FreeBSD as a VMware guest OS, install this port
would help you.  If you want to run X, install vmware-tools too.
