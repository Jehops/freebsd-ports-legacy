Wine-doors is an application designed to make installing windows software on
Linux, Solaris or other Unix systems easier. Wine-doors is essentially a
package management tool for windows software on Linux systems. Most Linux
desktop users are familiar with package management style application delivery,
so it made sense to apply this model to windows software.
