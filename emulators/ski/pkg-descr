Ski provides a functional IA-64 simulator, meaning that it simulates the
IA-64 architecture, as opposed to a particular implementation (such as
Itanium).  The advantage of a functional simulator is that it executes
quickly---Ski simulatues in excess of 2 million IA-64 instructions per
second on a fast Pentium-III.  On the other hand, since it doesn't
simulate the micro-architecture, it cannot be used for performance
tuning as the results would be completely meaningless.  For example,
Ski simulates instructions one at a time, whereas all IA-64 chips
allow simultaneous execution of multiple instructions.

Ski simulates the complete architecture, as defined by the IA-64
architecture manuals that can be found at the following URLs:

Ski can execute in one of two modes: system-mode or user-mode.  In
system-mode, both application and system-mode execution is simulated.
In user-mode, only application-level instructions are simulated.  All
system calls are intercepted and translated into corresponding calls
on the host OS (i.e., Linux/x86).  Since user-mode involves less
simulation, it executes faster.  On the other hand, certain things
(such as multi-threading) are not supported in user-mode execution.
Thus, for perfect simulation accuracy, it's best to use system-mode.
