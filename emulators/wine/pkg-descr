Wine is a Microsoft Windows 3.1/95/98/NT/2000 emulator running under Unix
on i386 (and compatible) CPUs.

It is still alpha quality, but is definitely making progress. Most
applications already work, more or less, including even a couple of games.

To use Wine, your kernel must be rebuilt with the following lines added
to the kernel config file (/sys/i386/conf/<YourMachine>):

options		USER_LDT
options		SYSVSHM
options		SYSVSEM
options		SYSVMSG
