Wine is a Microsoft Windows compatibility layer running under Unix-like
systems on i386 (and compatible) CPUs.

It is still alpha quality, but is definitely making progress. Most
applications already work, more or less, including several games.

Note: Versions of Wine after 20040505 fail upon startup on any version
of FreeBSD.  While still making sure that current versions of Wine build
on FreeBSD, I will not update this port until the problem (mmap related,
by the way), has been resolved.
