FreeBSD host notes:
- needs to run as root in order to use /dev/tap* networking (why?)
- slirp (usermode networking) compiles but doesn't seem to work for
me - seems to have a timer problem (time sleep 1 takes 49 seconds
and booting sleeps for minutes at the acd0 probe), but only on
_some_ guest systems (FreeSBIE, knoppix.)  An installed 5.2.1 guest
system works ok (this also doesn't happen with linux as host.)  And
enabling /dev/rtc doesn't help either... (not included since it
needs a patch to emulators/rtc.)
- using physical media doesn't work on 4.x hosts (missing DIOCGMEDIASIZE
ioctl)
