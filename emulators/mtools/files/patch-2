+# devices named here in order to access the DOS file systems.  You might give
+# ALL USERS access to ALL FLOPPY DISKS via the command
+#
+#     chmod a+rw /dev/fd[0-9]*
+#
+# or you might give SPECIFIC GROUP MEMBERS access to a PARTICULAR FLOPPY DISK

+#   [2] write a file system with ...... newfs_msdos -f 1440 /dev/fd0
+#   [3] then use mcopy/mdir etc. in the usual way.
