Subject: AMD/IOMMU: suppress PTE merging after initial table creation

The logic is not fit for this purpose, so simply disable its use until
it can be fixed / replaced. Note that this re-enables merging for the
table creation case, which was disabled as a (perhaps unintended) side
effect of the earlier "amd/iommu: fix flush checks". It relies on no
page getting mapped more than once (with different properties) in this
process, as that would still be beyond what the merging logic can cope
with. But arch_iommu_populate_page_table() guarantees this afaict.

This is part of XSA-275.
