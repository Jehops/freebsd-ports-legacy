SeaBIOS is an open source implementation of a 16bit X86 BIOS. SeaBIOS
can run in an emulator or it can run natively on X86 hardware with
the use of coreboot.

SeaBIOS is the default BIOS for qemu and kvm.

This is a git snapshot to be used with the emulators/qemu-devel port.
(compared to the version shipped with qemu 0.15.0 this snapshot adds
ahci boot disk support.)
