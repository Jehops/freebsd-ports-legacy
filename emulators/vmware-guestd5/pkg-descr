vmware-guestd daemon is for time synchronization with host OS and others.
Beware, this port is for FreeBSD _guest_ OS.  You don't need to install
this ports to FreeBSD _host_ OS.  This ports also installs a kernel modules
for FreeBSD guest.

If you want to run FreeBSD as a VMware guest OS, install this port
would help you.  If you want to run X, install vmware-tools too.

This port assumes that a) users want only "must-have" binaries and
b) guest OS runs on a certain architecture and never be changed.  For
those want full-feature of VMware Tools, use the installer bundled with
VMware Tools instead.
