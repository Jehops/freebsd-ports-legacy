This port revision fixes a sound problem (distortion) many have been 
experiencing with ZSNES on FreeBSD.

With this revision comes a new bug. You will have to restart ZSNES each 
time you modify the sound settings within the sound menu for them to work 
properly. 

Please let me know if you experience any other problems or if you have 
any information regarding this issue!
