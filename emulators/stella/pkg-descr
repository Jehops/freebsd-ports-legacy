Stella is a usable, and highly addictive, emulator of the Atari 2600
VCS system with sound support. 

Please refer to /usr/local/share/doc/stella (or equivalent on your
system) for the distribution documents and instructions. This package
contains no man page so this will be your only reference. 

If you're at all serious about your emulator then you SHOULD check out
these URL's in the order they're written:

  http://www4.ncsu.edu/~bwmott/www/2600/
  http://www.general.uwa.edu.au/u/darrins/2600/roms.html
  ftp://ftp.hackerz.com/hackerz/atari/web/index.html

This should get you started and provide you with numerous links to
other web sites. 

Most ROM's for the Atari 2600 VCS are, unfortunately,
copyright. Fortunately two ROM's have been included in this package
which are in the public domain. Two shell scripts, elk and okiedoke,
are included which start up the emulator with these ROM's
loaded. Numerous ROM's are also available on the net (see URL's
above). 

If you have any general Atari VCS questions then you might get a more
fruitful response by posting them to the stella mailing list (see
stella.txt), as the emulation and questions mailing list won't be
up-to-date with all things Atari. However the FreeBSD emulation
mailing list is dedicated to discussing the emulation of other systems
so don't be shy. Please check Section 25 of the handbook for
information on the FreeBSD mailing lists.

Share and enjoy,

Joel...
