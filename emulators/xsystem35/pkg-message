o make sure your kernel has been configured with options SHMMAXPGS=4096
  when you run on display 16bpp or deeper color.

o copy PREFIX/share/example/xsystem35/xsys35rc.sample
  to ~/.xsys35rc and fit it to your environment.

o install game data from AliceSoft's cdrom with
  PREFIX/bin/instgame.

o install X-TT for your real pleasure(optional).

  -devdsp none commandline option as the last resort.

enjoy!
