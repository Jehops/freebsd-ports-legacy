Get Linux procfs ready and initialize vmmon/vmnet as follows:

	${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/vmware.sh start

then you'll be ready to start vmware.

If you experience freezes on power on, be sure that the
ACPI module is not loaded.

Don't forget to load the kernel module aio.ko, or
options VFS_AIO in the kernel.  Otherwise expect problems.

If you have fairly recent 5.x system or running vmware3
on FreeBSD 4.x, make sure that you have sysctl
kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed set to 1, otherwise you will get

Cannot attach shared memory segment: Invalid argument.
Failed to initialize SVGA device.

errors on "Power On".

You can add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:
--- cut here ---
kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1
--- cut here ---

Don't miss the documents installed:

	vmware(1) ${PREFIX}/share/doc/vmware/*

If you want to learn more on how to configure vmnet
interfaces for multiple instances of VMware, please refer to
