Get Linux procfs ready and initialize vmmon/vmnet as follows:

	${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/vmware.sh start

then you'll be ready to start vmware.

Don't forget to load the kernel module aio.ko, or
options VFS_AIO in the kernel.  Otherwise expect problems.

If you have fairly recent 5.x system or running vmware3
on FreeBSD 4.x, make sure that you have sysctl
kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed set to 1, otherwise you will get

Cannot attach shared memory segment: Invalid argument.
Failed to initialize SVGA device.

errors on "Power On".

You can add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:
--- cut here ---
kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1
--- cut here ---

Don't miss the documents installed:

	vmware(1) ${PREFIX}/share/doc/vmware/*
