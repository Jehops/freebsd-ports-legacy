To activate the default joystick to key mapping, run the command

xjoypad -device /dev/input/js[device-id] &

where [device-id] depends on whether you are using using a standard game pad or
a usb game pad (it's probably going to be /dev/input/js0)

note that the -device switch is incorrectly stated as -devicefilename
in the documentation
