An x86 only Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Emulator,
with higher compatibility rates than snes9x.

This is the Linux binary version.

Note: This port exists due to performance issues (sound) with our native 
version that remain unfixed. When these issues are fixed, this port should 
be removed.
