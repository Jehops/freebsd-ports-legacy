Here are some patches for FreeBSD's kernel that are necessary for Wine
(Well not strictly _necessary_ but without them parts of it won't work).
They unfortunately didn't make it into the base distribution in time
for the 3.3 release code freeze...

patch-3.3-sys-sigtrap:
stop wine's SIGTRAP handler from being called in the sigreturn syscall,
causing problems for wine's internal debugger.  (It would still
correctly show a crash backtrace but all commands that use single-
stepping failed.)

Apply as follows:

	(cd /usr/src/sys && patch ) <patch-3.3-sys-sigtrap

and build a new kernel. (Don't forget to include the options USER_LDT,
SYSVSHM, SYSVSEM, and SYSVMSG which are required by Wine.)

4.x users: The sigtrap patch looks like it could also apply to 4.x but I
haven't tried.
