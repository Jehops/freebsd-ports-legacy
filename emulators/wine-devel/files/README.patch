Here are some patches for FreeBSD's kernel that are necessary for wine
(well not strictly _necessary_ but without them parts of it won't work.)
They unfortunately didn't make it into the base distribution in time
for the 3.3 release code freeze...

patch-3.3-sys-sigtrap:
stop wine's SIGTRAP handler from being called in the sigreturn syscall,
causing problems for wine's internal debugger.  (it would still
correctly show a crash backtrace but all commands that use single-
stepping failed.)

patch-3.3-sys-fsgs:
always set/use the sc_fs and sc_gs entries in the sigcontext struct,
making -stable behave the same as -current there.  this should finally
allow signal handling of a wine that was built on -stable to correctly
run on -current too.  The corresponding wine change is in the port in
patches/patch-af, it is also in wine's CVS tree now, so that file will
disappear when the port is updated after the next wine release.
(this one was MFC'd Nov 15 1999, so you only need it if you're running a
system from the -stable branch older than that, like a 3.3-RELEASE.  If you
happen to try to apply it when its already there patch(1) should complain
`Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [y]',
just hit ^C then...)

Apply as follows:

	(cd /usr/src/sys && patch ) <patch-3.3-sys-sigtrap

And if you don't already have it:

	(cd /usr/src/sys && patch ) <patch-3.3-sys-fsgs

then build a new kernel. (don't forget to include the options USER_LDT,
SYSVSHM, SYSVSEM, and SYSVMSG, wine needs these.)

-current users:
The sigtrap patch looks like it could also apply to -current but i haven't
tried.  And the fs/gs patch of course already is in -current.
