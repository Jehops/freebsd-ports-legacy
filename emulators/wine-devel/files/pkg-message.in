Wine requires FreeBSD 6.2 or above; for FreeBSD 6.x the kernel patch
provided at http://wiki.freebsd.org/Wine is recommended.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine
There is more in the source tree but the others are only useful in
conjunction with the rest of the source tree.
