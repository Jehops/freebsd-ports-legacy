Wine requires FreeBSD 6.2 or above; FreeBSD 7.0 or later is strongly
recommended.  For FreeBSD 6.x you may want to consider the patch(es)
provided at <http://wiki.freebsd.org/Wine>.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine
There is more in the source tree but the others are only useful in
conjunction with the rest of the source tree.
