Wine is a Microsoft Windows 3.1/95/98/NT/2000 emulator running under Unix
on i386 (and compatible) CPUs.

It is still alpha quality, but is definitely making progress. Most
applications already work, more or less, including even a couple of games.

To use Wine, your kernel must be rebuilt with the following lines added
to the kernel config file (/sys/i386/conf/<YourMachine>):

options		USER_LDT
options		SYSVSHM
options		SYSVSEM
options		SYSVMSG

Wine relies on the configuration file /usr/local/etc/wine.conf to
contain valid assignments of Unix directories to DOS drive letters,
and for certain other options (see "man wine" for details).
You will most probably have to to edit it, after the install...
