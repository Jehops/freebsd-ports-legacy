This port contains the sources for the packages in linux_base-rh-7.3.  It exists
for licencing purposes.  If you distribute the linux_base binary package or the
distfiles for it, which are also pre-compiled binaries, you can satisfy the
requirements of the GNU GPL by offering this package to your customers.  Sources
for RPM packages with other licences are omitted.

This port takes 52 MB of space when installed, and the same for the
package or distfiles.
