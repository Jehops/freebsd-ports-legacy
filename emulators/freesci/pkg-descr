FreeSCI is a portable interpreter for SCI games, such as the Space Quest
series (starting with SQ3) or Leisure Suit Larry (2 and sequels).

This release has the following limitations (plus some bugs):

- Only SCI0 games are supported
- The SCI debug functions aren't fully supported (and probably never will be,
  since we're using our own debug functions).
- Sound is not supported yet
- Graphics are slow, especially on displays not using 8bpp color index mode.
