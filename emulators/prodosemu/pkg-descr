Prodosemu is a text based Apple IIe ProDOS emulator. Unlike most
popular Apple emulators it does not use disk images, instead it uses
the UNIX file-system. If you have an Apple IIe then you will need to
transfer your programs/files into a directory somewhere with your
favorite comm's program. Otherwise you will need to install the aftp
port to pull the files out from the Apple disk images that are widely
available on the net (eg the ProDOS system disk available from
asimov).

The rom file (included) is stored in /usr/local/lib/apple2 (or similar
path on your system) under the name "prodos-2e.rom". I've adopted this
title so that Prodosemu can co-exist with the other apple emulators in
the ports collection.

There is no man page for this program so I have included the slightly
modified README at the end of this document. 

Share and enjoy,
