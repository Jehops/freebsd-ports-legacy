VMware tools support FreeBSD _guest_ OS running on VMware Workstation.
Beware, this port is _not_ for FreeBSD _host_ OS.

VMware tools for FreeBSD consist of vmware-toolbox which supports
seamless operation between the Host and the Guest OS, dual-boot
configulation files, and special X server for Guest OS.  However,
vmware-toolbox for FreeBSD lacks some features that vmware-toolbox for
Linux has, and dual-boot configulation is broken because checkvm
doesn't work.

So this port installs X server ONLY.  If you want vmware-toolbox,
install emulators/linux-vmware-toolbox on your FreeBSD _Guest_ OS.
