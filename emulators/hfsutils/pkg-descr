  HFS is the "Hierarchical File System" used on modern Macintosh computers.
  With this package, you can read and write Macintosh-formatted media such as
  floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and SCSI hard disks on most UNIX platforms. You can
  also format raw media into an HFS volume.

  This package contains a number of different tools:

    * Several command-line programs (hmount, hls, hcopy, et al.)
    * A Tk-based front-end for browsing and copying files through a
        variety of transfer modes (MacBinary, BinHex, text, etc.)
    * A Tcl package and interface for scriptable access to volumes
    * A C library for low-level access to volumes
