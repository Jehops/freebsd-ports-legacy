gRustibus is a M.A.M.E. frontend for the GNOME environment. Its goal is to 
be feature-rich and easy to use.  It shows screenshots, flyers, cabinet 
photos, and info for your M.A.M.E. ROMs, and allows you to configure each 
game individually. Most operations can be done using the keyboard.

Finally, something UNIX users can use to manage those ROMS, just as the 
Mac and Windows users have had for years :)
