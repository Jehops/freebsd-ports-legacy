Bochs is a highly portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in
C++, that runs on most popular platforms.  It includes emulation of the
Intel x86 CPU, common I/O devices, and a custom BIOS.  Currently, bochs can
be compiled to emulate a 386, 486 or Pentium CPU.

Bochs is capable of running many Operating Systems inside the emulation
including Linux, Windows 95, DOS, and Windows NT 4.

Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton and is currently maintained by the Bochs
project.
