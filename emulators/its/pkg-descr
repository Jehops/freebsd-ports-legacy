This is an image of a PI (Public ITS) filesystem that can be booted on
the KLH10 PDP-10 emulator.

The emulator image is about 45MB compressed and 170MB uncompressed.
The installation needs to have a minimum of 45MB in ports/disfiles
plus 45MB in the installation directory which defaults to
/usr/local/share/klh10-ks-its.  That's about 90MB total but "make
distclean" will delete 45MB leaving you with only 45MB.  After "make
install" you must run the "its-user-install" script as a regular user
to install an uncompressed 170MB RP06 filesystem image and setup
emulator support files.  Additional 170MB RP06 filesystem images
may also be installed.
