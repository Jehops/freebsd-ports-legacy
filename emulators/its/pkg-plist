@comment There's some hiccups if we try to specify an absolute
@comment filename here, so we cd first.
@cwd /
%%IMAGE_HOME%%/PI-ITS-RP06.0-dbd9.bz2
%%IMAGE_HOME%%/klh10-kn-freebsd.ini.in
@comment We specify to delete %%IMAGE_HOME%%.  In most cases, it's the
@comment same as the klh10 port is using, so it won't be empty (and thus
@comment not deleted).  This dirrm command is for the exceptions to that.
@unexec rmdir %D/%%IMAGE_HOME%% 2>/dev/null || true
