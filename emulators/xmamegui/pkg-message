XMAMEGUI has been installed.

When you start it and asks for the "Screenshot Path" directory make sure it is
writable by you, since by default it will automatically download game preview
images to there. For example "~/.parallelrealities/xmamegui/prv" could be used
(note that it has to be created manually).
