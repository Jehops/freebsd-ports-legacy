This is a development version of the Willows toolkit. While this code
still needs more development to work fine, developers are encouraged to
contribute to the Twine (Twin-Experimental) project instead since all new
code will then be available under a benign license to the WINE people.

Twine development is hosted by CodeWeavers, Inc. CodeWeavers provides
services to assist developers in porting Windows software to Linux and
other alternate operating systems.
