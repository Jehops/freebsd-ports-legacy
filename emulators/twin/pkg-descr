The Willows TWIN libraries are both a set of native platform
libraries and an emulator program to emulate the Microsoft Win32
API. The emulator program allows executing Windows binary programs
on supported Unix platforms, on native Intel x86 processors, and
through the built-in intstruction set interpreter. The native
libraries allow programmers to natively build Win32 and MFC
applications from source code.
