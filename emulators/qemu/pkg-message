FreeBSD host notes:
- needs to run as root in order to use /dev/tap* networking (why?)
- slirp (usermode networking) is fixed now in cvs, on FreeSBIE guests
you still have to manually do:
	echo nameserver 10.0.2.3 >/etc/resolv.conf
but i've been told that that's normal. (and you have to wait a bit
for dhclient to do its thing; traffic to address 10.0.2.2 is routed
to 127.1 on the host)
- expect timer problems when guest kernel HZ is > hosts
(for example time sleep 1 takes 49 seconds and booting sleeps for
minutes at the acd0 probe with a FreeSBIE guest, thats because
the FreeSBIE kernel is built with HZ=5000, and FreeBSD's default
is 100...  The linux 2.6 kernel uses 1000 by default btw.)  Enabling
/dev/rtc doesn't seem to help either (not included since it needs a
patch to emulators/rtc.)
- using physical media doesn't work on 4.x hosts (missing DIOCGMEDIASIZE
ioctl)
- leaving X grab with shift-ctrl now often leaves shift or ctrl `pressed'
for the guest, hitting it once fixes that
