FreeBSD host notes:
- needs to run as root in order to use /dev/tap* networking (why?)
- slirp (usermode networking) still has a dhcp problem at least for
FreeSBIE guests even with the fix now in cvs, to use it you have to
manually do:
	ifconfig ed0 10.0.2.15
	route add default 10.0.2.2
	echo nameserver 10.0.2.3 >/etc/resolv.conf
(traffic to address 10.0.2.2 is routed to 127.1 on the host)
- seems to have a timer problem (time sleep 1 takes 49 seconds
and booting sleeps for minutes at the acd0 probe), but only on
_some_ guest systems (FreeSBIE, knoppix 3.4 with 2.6 kernel.)
knoppix 3.4 with the 2.4 kernel and an installed 5.2.1 guest system
work ok (this also doesn't happen with linux as host.)  And enabling
/dev/rtc doesn't help either... (not included since it needs a
patch to emulators/rtc.)
- using physical media doesn't work on 4.x hosts (missing DIOCGMEDIASIZE
ioctl)
