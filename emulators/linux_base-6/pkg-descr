These libraries are part of the linux compatibility options
for FreeBSD.  To get linux compat working you will need

1) A linux binary such as doom, Wingz, or maple

2) a kernel with ``options LINUX_COMPAT'' in the config file

3) these libraries

4) the linux compat lkm (ie run /usr/bin/linux)

then run the linux binary.
