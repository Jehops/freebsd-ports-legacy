SDLMESS is a port of the popular MESS. There are a few principles that guide
it's development:

1) Run on Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and other SDL supported operating systems with
   as few changes as possible to the base Win32 code. This means we can track
   changes faster than larger more conventional ports, and we also maintain
   what I call "Firefox compatibilty" where learning a major app only needs to
   be done once per application, and it then applies across many operating
   systems. If you can use the command-line Win32 MESS, you already know how
   to use SDLMESS on any platform you may encounter it on.

2) MESS developers are important. By keeping quickly up to date, we make it
   easy for people on non-Windows platforms to make and submit changes to the
   core MESS code, and we offer native implementations of MESS's multi-window
   GUI debugger on both Linux/Unix and Mac OS X.
