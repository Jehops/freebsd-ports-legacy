Virtual Game Boy is the Nintendo GameBoy(tm) emulator on X-Window.

  Test your VGB installation with the command(default):

	vgb /usr/X11R6/share/VGB/CART.GB

  You buy the cartridges. GameBoy software is copyrighted and still sold. 
Therefore, its distribution is an act of piracy. Nothing prohibits you 
from backing up a cartridge you own and playing it on the emulator though.
To back up a GameBoy cartridge, you can use either SmartCard copier (about
$100 for a standalone version), or a self-built copier designed by Pascal 
Felber, description of which is available at:
