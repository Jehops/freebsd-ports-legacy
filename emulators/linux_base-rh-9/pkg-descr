This port contains packages from a near-minimal installation of Red
Hat Linux 9.  These packages, in conjunction with the linux module,
form the basis of the Linux compatibility environment.

This port is only available for the i386 architecture.  If you use an Alpha
computer, please install the linux_base port instead of this one.

If you want to run X11 applications, install the x11/linux-XFree86-libs port.
