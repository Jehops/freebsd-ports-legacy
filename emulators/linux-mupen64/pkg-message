You must run 'linux-mupen64_install' as the user you intend to use mupen64 with
before 'linux-mupen64' will work.

Note:

For some of the graphics plugins to work, you must have a working libGLU.so.1
and libGLcore.so.1 file located in /compat/linux/usr/lib/

If you're using the FreeBSD nVidia drivers, you can create a link to libGLU.so.1
by issuing the following command as root:

ln -s /compat/linux/usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.so.1 /compat/linux/usr/lib/libGLU.so.1

The other file should already be there. If not, look for it, and create a link.

Enjoy!
