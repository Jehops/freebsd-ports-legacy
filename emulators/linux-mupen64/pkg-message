You must run 'linux-mupen64_install' as the user you intend to use mupen64 with
before 'linux-mupen64' will work!

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you should probably backup your 
~/.linux-mupen64 directory and re-run the installation script.

Note: This port is only known to work with nVidia boards. Sorry :-\

Enjoy!
