You must run 'linux-mupen64_install' as the user you intend to use mupen64 with
before 'linux-mupen64' will work. If you are upgrading from a previous version,
you should probably backup your ~/.linux-mupen64 directory and re-run the 
installation script.

Note:

For some of the graphics plugins to work, you must have a working libGLcore.so.1
file located in /compat/linux/usr/lib/

Enjoy!
