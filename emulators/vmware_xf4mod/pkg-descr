This is the VMware module for XFree86 4.x. It should only be used inside of a
VMWare guest as it refers only to the virtualized "hardware" available to
an operating system running under VMware. Use the following in your XF86Config
file:

Section "Device"
	Identifier "VMware SVGA"
	Driver "vmware"
	BusID	"PCI:0:15:0"
EndSection

The BusID line is required or X will think that the virtual ISA VGA card
(where the text screens live) is the primary one and it will fail.

Be sure to use the same depth on the guest as you do on the host or the
X server won't start. You can arrange for this simply by not including a
"DefaultDepth" line. The driver will then supply the correct default.
