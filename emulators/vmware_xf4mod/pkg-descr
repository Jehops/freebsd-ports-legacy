This is the VMware module for XFree86 4.x. It should only be used inside of a
VMWare guest as it refers only to the virtualized "hardware" available to
an operating system running under VMware. Use the following in your XF86Config
file:

Section "Device"
	Identifier "VMware SVGA"
	Driver "vmware"
	BusID	"PCI:0:15:0"
EndSection
