PDP-8, PDP-11, PDP-1, other 18b PDP, Nova, and IBM 1401 simulators.

The simulators have been tested on VAX VMS, Alpha VMS, Alpha UNIX, Intel
FreeBSD and Intel LINUX; a port to Windows 95 and Windows NT is in progress
but lacks terminal emulation code.  Porting to other environments will
require changes to the operating system dependent code in scp_tty.c.

These simulators are capable of running the Unix V5, V6 and V7 binaries
licenced for non-commercial use by SCO.  See ${WRKDIR}/simh_doc.txt for
further details.
