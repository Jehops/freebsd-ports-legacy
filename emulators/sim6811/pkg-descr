from main.c:

  very simple and crude simulator for the 6811

  some instructions aren't there yet (notably converning multiplication
  and interrupts) and the interface only allows stepping.  this should
  be easily rectifiable, however, and the simple structure should make
  grafting on a graphical interface quite simple.

I am calling this version 1.6, to reflect the revision number of
sim.h, which appears to be common to all (three) source files.
