+ .Sh NAME
+ .Nm sim6811
+ .Nd very simple and crude simulator for the 6811
+ .Sh SYNOPSIS
+ .Nm sim6811
+ .Ar s19-file
+ .Sh DESCRIPTION
+ .Ar s19-file
+ is a Motorola s19 assembler output file
+ 
+ some instructions aren't there yet (notably converning multiplication
+ and interrupts) and the interface only allows stepping.  this should
+ be easily rectifiable, however, and the simple structure should make
+ grafting on a graphical interface quite simple.
+ 
+ to run the simulator, just provide the name of an object file on the
+ command line.  the object file must be in s19 format, and must include
+ a reset vector in order to tell the simulator where to start
+ execution.  simulation proceeds one instruction at a time, with a
+ register and page zero memory dump being performed at each step.
+ 
+ several simple commands are supported, but additional commands to
+ modify memory, cause interrupts and simulate the special registers
+ would all be nice, and relatively easy to add.
+ 
+ .Sh COMMANDS
+ 
+ The current
+ .Nm sim6811
