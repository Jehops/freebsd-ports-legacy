A Sega Genesis/CD/32X emulator that uses the SDL library and has a GTK 
user interface.

Note: This is not the latest version of gens available for *nix. The
latest version makes use of the Linux-specific header file 'linux/cdrom.h' 
which causes the build to fail.

Patches to get the latest version working on FreeBSD are more than 
welcome!
