XGngeo is a frontend (GUI) for Gngeo which is a powerful command line Neo Geo
emulator for the GNU/Linux, FreeBSD system (and may be some other Unices). Both
are free softwares released under the GNU GPL license.

XGngeo is written in Python and uses the PyGTK library to provide a complete,
pratical, and user-friendly GTK+ interface over Gngeo!

With XGngeo multiple configuration panels, designed in an intuitive way,
emulator behaviour can be regulated both precisely and easily; while Rom
selection is made simple thanks to a full featured list with preview image and
various game information, etc.
