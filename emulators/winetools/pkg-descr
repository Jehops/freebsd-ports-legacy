WineTools is a collection of tools for WINE. You can do the following
things with it:

- Install an application: You can choose a setup program which will
be run with Wine. There is also an option to install DCOM98, this
is needed to make some Installshield installers (as used by
Dreamweaver, Flash, etc) work.

- Uninstall an application: Every application that creates a registry
entry and has an uninstall function can be uninstalled (does not
work for uninstallers which use rundll32.exe).

- Create a Windows directory structure with registry and configuration
file in $HOME/.wine

- Create and edit a WINE config file.

- Install TrueType Fonts.
