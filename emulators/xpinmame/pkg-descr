xpinmame is the X11 port of PinMAME, the Pinball Console emulator.

It runs pinball roms from Williams/Bally games, from 1977 onwards to
the new WPC system, around 1998. It also runs some Data East games.

It includes simulators to artificially press the 'switches' on the table,
however it does not simulate any game play, nor a real pinball table.
