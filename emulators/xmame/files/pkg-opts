#
DISPLAY_TARGET|sdl|Set this to one of the following:
		sdl	Uses the SDL library to be able to play fullscreen
			games without having to have root rights.
		opengl	Uses OpenGL libraries for hardware accelerrated screen
			scaling.
		x11	Use the standard X11 libraries. Need to be root to
			play fullscreen games.
		svgalib	Uses the svgalib library for console play. This
			target is not working yet; patches to make it work
			most warmly welcomed.
WITH_ASM68K|no|If set to 'yes', this will enable the speedier but buggy
	assembler 68x00 CPU emulation cores. This will only work on x86.
	Note that some games are known to break with this option, among
	them pbobble2.
WITH_OPTIMIZATION|no|If set to 'yes', this will enable maximum C compiler
	optimization. Due to the fact that these optimization levels
	sometimes uncover hidden GCC bugs, this is disabled by default.
	Enable at your own risk.
WITH_ESOUND|no|If set to 'yes', compile with the esound libraries for
	nice behaviour in a GNOME environment.
WITH_DATFILES|yes|If set to 'yes', this installs additional information
	with MAME, including cheats, history of games, and highscores.
	This is a MAME-only option.
WITH_NETWORK|yes|If set to 'yes', include support for network play.
	This can be disabled because there might be a speed increase
	without it.
