X-Mame 0.30.1 is an emulator.  It emulates many classic coin-operated arcade
game machines, right on your FreeBSD PC.

This emulator supports over 200 arcade games, and the nunmber grows every
day!  A partial list of the (more popular and well-known) games currently
supported by this emulator include:

PacMan, Ms. PacMan, Jr. PacMan, Super PacMan, Dig Dug, Star Trek, Galaga,
Space Invaders, Tempest, Frogger, Mr. Do!, Battle Zone, Missile Command,
Asteroids, Burger Time, Centipede, Millipede, Gorf, Donkey Kong, Donkey
Kong III, Donkey Kong Jr., Mario Bros., Defender, Stargate, Galaxians,
Gyruss, Kangaroo, Moon Patrol, Phoenix, Q*Bert, Rally X, Robotron,
Star Wars, Zaxxon, ... you get the idea.

To run these games, however, you will need images of the ROM chips that
are used on these games.  If you actually have one of these games (or the
motherboard to one of them), and access to a ROM burner, it is a fairly
trivial process to make ROM image files for use with MAME.  If you DON'T
have access to a ROM burner, or you don't own one of these video games
(and you are aware of the possible legal ramifications of doing this),
you can obtain ROM images for MAME on the Net.
