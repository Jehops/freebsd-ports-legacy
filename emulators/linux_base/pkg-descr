This port contains Linux binary packages from Red Hat Linux 7.3.  These
packages, in conjunction with the linux.ko kernel module, form the basis of the
Linux compatibility environment.

This port is available for the i386 architecture and experimentally for amd64.
If you use an Alpha computer, please install the linux_base-debian or
linux_base-gentoo-stage1 port instead.
