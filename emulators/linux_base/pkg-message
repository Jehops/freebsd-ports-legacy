Installation of the Linux base system is finished. The Linux kernel mode, which
must be enabled for Linux binaries to run, is now enabled.  Linux mode can be
enabled permanently with the linux_enable variable of rc.conf(5).

When using NIS, be sure to edit yp.conf in /compat/linux/etc/.

You may wish to create and populate /compat/linux/dev/ if you plan to chroot
into your Linux installation.  For example:

	mkdir /compat/linux/dev
	mknod /compat/linux/dev/null c 2 2
	chmod 666 /compat/linux/dev/null
