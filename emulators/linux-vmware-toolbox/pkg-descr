This is the full-featured Linux version VMware toolbox for FreeBSD
_Guest_ OS.  Beware, this port is _not_ for FreeBSD _Host_ OS.

As VMware toolbox included in VMware tools for FreeBSD is not as good
as that for Linux, it lacks some useful features such as time
synchronization between the virtual machine and the Host OS.  That is
why this port is provided.


Before installing this port, make sure you have a `linux.flp' file
that comes with VMware:

	Windows NT/2000: C:\Program Files\VMware\Programs\linux.flp
	Linux: /usr/lib/vmware/lib/floppies/linux.flp
	FreeBSD (via ports): ${PREFIX}/lib/vmware/lib/floppies/linux.flp
