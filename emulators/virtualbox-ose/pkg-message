=============================================================================

VirtualBox was installed.

You need to load the vboxdrv kernel module via /boot/loader.conf:

vboxdrv_load="YES"

For bridged networking please add the following line to your /etc/rc.conf:

vboxnet_enable="YES"

Reboot the machine to load the needed kernel modules.

You also have to add all users to your vboxusers group in order to use vbox.

% pw groupmod vboxusers -m jerry

Running VirtualBox as non-root user may fail with a fatal error 
NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED. In this case delete /tmp/.vbox-*-ipc file.
