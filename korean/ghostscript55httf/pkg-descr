GNU Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

        - An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, and

        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement
the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the
PostScript language.

GNU Ghostscript comes with NO WARRANTY and NO SUPPORT.  

Also included with this package is the PCL3 driver written by Martin
Lottermoser with defaults for a Deskjet 560C.

This version can handle Korean(and Japanese) Truetype fonts
using FreeType library. It also has some bugfix for correctly working 
CID-Keyed fonts.
