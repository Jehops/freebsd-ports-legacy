hanmiscutils is a collection of various Hangul-related sources.  Especially,
it contains libhanconv, general purpose Hangul code conversion library, so
that you can use it with your own program.

hanmiscutils is free software; basically you can do almost anything with 
it, unless you claim you wrote it (i. e. removing the existing copyright 
notice and attaching your own copyright is prohibited).  See the sources
for more details.
