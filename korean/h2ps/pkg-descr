h2ps formats each named file for printing in a postscript printer with
embedded PS hangul fonts; if no file is given, h2ps reads from the
standard input. The format used is nice and compact: normally two pages 
on each physical page, borders surrounding pages, headers with useful 
information (page number, printing date, file name or supplied header), 
line numbering, etc. This is very useful for making archive listings of
programs.

It is relatively compat when comparing with nh2ps, and no need to another
fonts or ghostscript. It can be printed with any PostScript printer only
with english fonts because its fonts are embedded with output.
