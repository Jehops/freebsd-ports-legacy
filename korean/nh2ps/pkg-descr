nh2ps-1.0p1
-----------

nh2ps formats each named file for printing in a postscript printer with
HLaTeX-0.95 PS Type1 Hangul fonts; if no file is given, nh2ps reads from the
standard input. The format used is nice and compact: normally two pages 
on each physical page, borders surrounding pages, headers with useful 
information (page number, printing date, file name or supplied header), 
line numbering, etc. This is very useful for making archive listings of
programs.

It is relatively large when comparing with h2ps, and need to another 
installed fonts and ghostscript.
