Korean locale for linux_lib
===========================

For running some linux-emulation program such as hanIM, you may
need this for correctly working setlocale() for ko locale.

glibc(prior 2.1) have no true multilingual support, so this locale
definition is broken but sufficient for running X11 applications.

This definition files(LC_CTYPE, LC_TIME, etc.) is from
Alzza Linux distribution, a leading Linux distribution in Korea.
