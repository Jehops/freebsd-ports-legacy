hTeXp, an implementation of TeX for hangul
==========================================

hTeXp is a replacement of a TeX complier in the sense that hTeXp compiles a
text file created by any text editor into a dvi file for further processing
such as previewing or printing.

There are many reasons using hTeXp but the most important one is that it
handles hangul nicely. A non-localized version of TeX has serious problems
in displaying hangul messages on a terminal screen and writing hangul 
textual information onto the auxiliary files such as log or index.

hTeXp has solved such problems, therefore, the use of hTeXp is strongly
recommanded when using hLaTeXp, a version of hangul LaTeX2e created by
the same author.
