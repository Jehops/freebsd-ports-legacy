GNU Postscript/PDF interpriter.
This port depends on print/ghostscript-cjk that is internationalized
version of ghostscript.  This port simply adds necessary configuration
as /usr/local/share/ghostscript/*/lib/CIDFnmap.ko

To install more fancy fonts edit the CIDFnmap.kr file.
To know how to edit, /usr/local/share/doc/ghostscript/CJK/README.kr
is helpful.

Internationalization information:
For those who are interested in reading also Chinese and Japanese PS files,
one can simply add either or both of chinese/ghostscript-gnu-cjk  and 
japanese/ghostscript-gnu-cjk.   There is no conflict in adding and removing 
these ports.  Have fun!
