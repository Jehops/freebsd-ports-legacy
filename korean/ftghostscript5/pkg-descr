Ghostscript with FreeType(Korean)
=================================

This is Aladdin Ghostscript, the non-GPL version that comes
with a licence different from the GPL. Read the file PUBLIC in the
work/gsX.Y directory or in /usr/local/share/ghostscript/X.Y/doc/PUBLIC
after installation for details !

This version can handle Korean(and Japanese) Truetype fonts
using FreeType library. It also has some bugfix for correctly working 
CID-Keyed fonts.
