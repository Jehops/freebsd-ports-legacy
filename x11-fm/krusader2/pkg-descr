Krusader is a File Manager for KDE, patterned after
old-school managers like Midnight Commander and Norton
Commander. It features basically all your file-management
needs, plus extensive archive handling, supporting many
archive formats, mounted filesystems support, ftp, and
much much more.

It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly,
fast, and good looking :-)
