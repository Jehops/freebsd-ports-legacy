Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE 3.1
or later, similar to Midnight or Total Commander, with many extras. It 
provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.

Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced 
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content 
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.

It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, 
arj and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb or fish. It is 
(almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks great 
on your desktop! :-) 

Many things changed since 1.40, so here's some hightlights:
* New user-action system, which allows you to define your own
  personal krusader-actions.
  Please take a look at the tutorial that comes in the doc\ section
* 3rd Panel: new popup-panel that can display quick view, tree etc. Just click
  the little arrow button on the bottom of each panel.
* ISO protocol now allows you to step into .iso files
* Cut, Copy and Paste: ctrl-v, ctrl-c and ctrl-x is working
