Krusader is an advanced twin-panel (commander-style) file-manager for KDE 3.x 
(similar to Midnight or Total Commander) but with many extras. It provides all 
the file-management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced 
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content 
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, 
arj and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks 
great on your desktop! :-)

Many things changed since 1.30, so here's some hightlights:
* Configuring custom color for the panel (much requested feature)
* Quick-mode for mountman (just press and HOLD the mountman icon)
* Panel is now configurable (which columns to show, show icons or not ...)
* Support for single-click selection mode
* New toolbar for the panel
* a Locate frontend
* A new konfigurator (thanks to csaba)
* New quick-search mode for the panel (thanks to heiner)
* Ability to edit/view files from the search results window
* A folder-history button, a-la-total commander. thanks to Hans Loffler
* Synchronizer (thanks csaba)
* File splitter
