Dolphin is a file manager for KDE focusing on usability. It is not intended
to be a competitor to Konqueror, the default KDE file manager: Konqueror acts
as universal viewer being able to show HTML pages, text documents, directories
and a lot more, whereas Dolphin focuses on being only a file manager. This
approach allows to optimize the user interface for the task of file management.
