Nautilus is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being
developed by Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the GNOME project,
and its source code can be found in the GNOME CVS repository.
Nautilus is still in the early stages of development.  It will
become an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment when it
is finished.
