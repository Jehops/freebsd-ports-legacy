DFM is a desktopmanager for X Window System. Files are shown 
as icons and every folder has it's own window. The desktopbackground 
is a special folder in the homedirectory.

The idea is to write a filemanager like the OS/2 WPS.

Here are some features:

* icons may have any size and position 
* show XVPICS as icons
* save icon and window info
* iconname to cutbuffer (paste to xterm, ...)
* "Constant position" icons that cannot be moved (or arranged)
* easy adding new programs to the desktop
* Offix DND support
