Worker is a file-manager exclusive for X based on the famous filemanager
"DirectoryOpus" on the AmigaOS. It is configurable on the fly without
restarting Worker. Any extern program can be easily integrated in the GUI,
including a button and a hotkey. Worker uses real file-recognition on
file-content AND/OR file-ending, where each file-type can get it's own action.
