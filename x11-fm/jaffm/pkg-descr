Jaffm is a lightweight wxWindows (GTK+ interface) file manager for
Unix, written in C++. It is aimed at nonsense-free file management. It
is mostly inspired by the List View in Mac OS Finder, but also has
Unix-handy features such as an interactive location bar with Bash-style
tab completion, and a simple but elegant user interface.
