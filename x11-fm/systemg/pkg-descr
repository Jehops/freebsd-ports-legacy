System G

Dealing with the UNIX command line, especially the file system, is
one of the biggest hurdles to widespread use of UNIX and Linux.
System G was written to provide simple, intuitive access to the
file system in the form of a graphical hierarchy of files and
folders, based on the design of the Macintosh System 7.
