#
# MOVED - a list of (recently) moved or removed ports
#
# $FreeBSD$
#
# Each entry consists of a single line containing the following four
# fields in the order named, separated with the pipe (`|') character:
#
#     Port:	A port that was moved (category/portname).
#     Moved to:	Where the port was moved to, or which port users
#		can and should migrate to (category/portname).
#		Blank indicates that the port was deleted.
#     Date:	When the moving or the removal was done (YYYY-MM-DD,
#		in PST/PDT).
#     Why:	The reason why the port was moved or removed.
#
# Keep this list sorted in the chronological order.  New entries must
# be added at the tail.
#
# If previously removed port gets restored, make sure to delete the relevant
# line.  If a port is copied to a new location and the old location is kept
# (e.g. upgraded to a later version), don't record it here.
#
