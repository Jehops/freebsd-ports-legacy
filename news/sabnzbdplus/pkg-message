Due to the version of devel/py-cheetah in ports api keys do
not work. To get around the error modify the following line 
in your sabnzbd.ini file:

    disable_api_key = 1

Note however that by disabling the api key feature you may
be at risk of the Cross-site Request Vulnerability described
here: http://sabnzbd.wikidot.com/cross-site-vulnerability/
