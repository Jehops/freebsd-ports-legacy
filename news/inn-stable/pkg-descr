InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading is handled
by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each client.  Both innd
and nnrpd have some slight variances from the NNTP protocol.

This is the new version 2.x, maintained by the ISC

Installation is relatively complex but nicely explained in the
file INSTALL, see the inn2 sources under the work directory.
