InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system. The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading is handled
by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each client.  Both innd
and nnrpd have some slight variances from the NNTP protocol. It's also
possible to have UUCP and NNTP feeds and clients.

Some statements to meet the COPYRIGHT:
- This is the new version, maintained by the ISC
- This product includes software developed by Rich Salz
- The only changes that have been made are a post-install target in the
  Makefile of the FreeBSD port, so that the news spool area is created
  automatically for ease of use of our inn2 port in the FreeBSD ports collection

Installation is relatively complex but nicely explained in the file INSTALL,
see the inn2 sources under the work directory.
