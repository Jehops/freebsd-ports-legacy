DIABLO is a backbone news transit system, designed to replace INND on
backbone machines. DIABLO UNDERSTANDS NEWSFEEDS ONLY, IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
NEWSREADER CLIENTS!. You cannot run diablo on a machine which needs to
accept nntp post commands or newsreading-related nntp commands. You cannot
point your NNTPSERVER at a host running Diablo.

Diablo is strictly a backbone news transit system. It will accept newsfeeds
using the ihave or the streaming check/takethis protocols, and it can
generate newsfeeds using ihave or streaming check/takethis protocols. Diablo
maintains a news spool and dhistory file, but the spool and history file is
arranged very differently from INN.

Diablo is also between 10 and 20 times as fast as INN in regards to incoming
feeds, and extremely efficient for outgoing feeds. I have been running
Diablo on BEST Internet's backbone news machine for several weeks now, and
it has run flawlessly.

If you have a dedicated newsfeeds machine which does feeds, feeds, and
nothing but feeds, Diablo may be for you.
