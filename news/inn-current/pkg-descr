InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the package
is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading is handled
by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each client.  Both innd
and nnrpd have some slight variances from the NNTP protocol.
This ports is the development version, DON'T USE IT OR TRY TO USE IT ON 
A PRODUCTION SERVER.
