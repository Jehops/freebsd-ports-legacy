It is intended that rkive be run by cron on a daily basis. In this manner,
software is archived and available for retrieval from the archives on the
day it reaches the machine.  It allows for the archives to be managed by
the same or different people (or accounts).  It supports the building
of indexes for later review or to interface to the netlib type of mail
retrieval software. It also supports mailing notifications of the archiving
to a specified list of users or aliases. The indexes and log file formats
are specifiable by the person configuring the rkive configuration file.
