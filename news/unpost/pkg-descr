UNPOST is a tool designed primarily to extract binaries from USENET
binaries postings such as those made to alt.binaries.pictures.misc
and comp.binaries.ibm.pc.  As well as extracting binaries from USENET
postings, UNPOST can extract binaries from multi-segment uuencoded
mailings as well, however, to simplify this documentation only
USENET article postings will be discussed.  The principles are the
same for multi-segment mailings.
