xmitBin allows you to post large binary postings (well, any large posting)
to usenet newsgroups, to someone via e-mail, or both.  It will post
intelligently, meaning uuencoding binaries, splitting large files across
multiple postings, and generally making it easier for those reading your
posts to find and decode all pieces of your post, and not getting usenet
site admins mad at you for posting large binaries in one chunk.  If you've
ever wanted to post to any of the alt.binaries.* groups, this is the tool
for you!

I have included two shell scripts of my own, "mailbin" and "postbin".
These scripts make it easy to mail and post (respectively) stuff using
a good default set of command line switches.
