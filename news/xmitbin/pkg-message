A couple of notes on this package/port...

* I have included two scripts of my own design, postbin and mailbin.
  They allow you to easily mail and post stuff using a fairly generic
  (i.e. probably useful for most people) set of options.

* Documentation and sample configuration files are located in
  /usr/local/lib/xmitBin/.

* A script, autoSend, has been included.  This script is intended to be
  run automatically (e.g. by cron(8)).  It will allow you to periodically
  post stuff on a regular basis.  See the "autoSend.txt" documentation
  file for more information.  The script is located at
  /usr/local/lib/xmitBin/autoSend.  Each user who wishes to use it
  should copy it to a directory where scripts are kept (e.g. $HOME/bin),
  and then modify it to suit him/her according to the directions.
