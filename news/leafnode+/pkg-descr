Leafnode+ is a simple NNTP server designed for small sites, derived from
the Leafnode package.

Leafnode+ only downloads those newsgroups which have been recently
accessed by users, reducing the amount of bandwidth required
considerably.

Leafnode+ contains several enhancements from the original Leafnode.
