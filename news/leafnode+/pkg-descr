Leafnode+ is a simple NNTP server designed for small sites, derived from
the Leafnode package.

Leafnode+ only downloads those newsgroups which have been recently
accessed by users, reducing the amount of bandwidth required
considerably.

Leafnode+ contains several enhancements from the original Leafnode.

You can setenv `LEAFNODE_SETUP_WRKDIRS' variable to `yes' before
you make install or pkg_add and needed working directiries
(typically PREFIX/lib/leafnode and /var/spool/leafnode)
are setup automatically.
