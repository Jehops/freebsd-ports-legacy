Leafnode+ is a simple NNTP server designed for small sites, derived from
the Leafnode package.

Leafnode+ only downloads the contents of newsgroups that users have
accessed recently, considerably reducing bandwidth requirements.

When installing Leafnode+ for the first time, set the
LEAFNODE_SETUP_WRKDIRS environment variable to "yes" before running make
install or pkg_add.  This creates the configuration files and a working
directory required to run Leafnode+, typically PREFIX/lib/leafnode and
/var/spool/leafnode.
