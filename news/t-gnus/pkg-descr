The gnus Newsreader
*******************

   You can read news (and mail) from within Emacs by using gnus.  The
news can be gotten by any nefarious means you can think of--NNTP, local
spool or your mbox file.  All at the same time, if you want to push your
luck.

   T-gnus provides MIME features based on SEMI API.  So T-gnus supports
your right to read strange messages including big images or other
various kinds of formats.  T-gnus also supports
internationalization/localization and multiscript features based on MULE
API.  So T-gnus does not discriminate various language communities.
Oh, if you are a Klingon, please wait Unicode Next Generation.
