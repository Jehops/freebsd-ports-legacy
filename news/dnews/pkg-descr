DNEWS Feature list
==================

	Dynamic sucking feed.
		A sucking feed may use as little as 10% of the normal
		disk space and network bandwidth.
		By only getting news items that people usually read 
		very large savings are possible particularly for small
		sites & workgroups.  A hundred users can be supported
		on 100 MB depending on their reading habbits!
		I run a single user server on my NT as a background
		service, it's using less than 5MB.
	Flexible expire settings 
		By allowing expiration by 'number of items' low volume groups
		become much more useful.  Also by allowing settings 
		which change with disk space the system is much more
		stable to large influxes of news.
	Flexible access restrictions
		Reading and Posting access can be given separately to
		to different users and selections of news groups.
	Binarys available for common platforms
		On many platforms you do not need to build the binary
		yourself, e.g. VMS, (VAX & ALPHA), Solaris, Linux, Windows NT
	Email confirmation of posts
		DNEWS can be configured to send email confirmations as it
		sends items up to a main news server.  This gives users 
		a clear record of a posted item and it's successful 
		transfer into the 'net'.
	Items stored in a database
		Items are stored in a database which puts items together
		in blocks of 100.  This saves directory entries, inodes,
		and the empty space usually wasted due to blocking factors.
		Also file open and closes are minimized, this is essential
		on systems where this is a 'costly' operation, e.g. VMS.
	Compiling and porting relatively easy
		DNEWS was designed to be portable from the ground up, it 
		does not rely on obscure UNIX features.
	Installation easy, totally configurable without recompiling
		DNEWS can be configured without recompiling and all
		the configuration scripts have been simplified where 
		possible.
	Documentated
		A user manual is available.
	Supported
		EMAIL support is available for help with installation
		and management.
	Speed
		On comparable systems DNEWS typically out performs other
		news software, (even the likes of CNEWS and INN in some
		instances), other VMS news servers don't even come close.  
		This is partly because DNEWS uses a more advanced database
		to store the news items.  The difference is also very 
		noteable on smaller systems (e.g. Linux)
	XOVER implemented in software
		No xover database is created, the normal DNEWS database
		is fast enough to create this information 'on the fly'
	Streaming support
		Streaming NNTP extensions are built in.
	Strictly limited machine impact due to single threaded nature.
		DNEWS runs on a single process, this speeds up connect
		time as a process does not need to be created, and it
		self-limits the impact on the system.
Limitations
===========

	DNEWS does not store items in the same file structure as used by
	INN and CNEWS, so old software which accesses these files directly
	will not work.
