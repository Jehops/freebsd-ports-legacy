This is a port of slnr (Simple Local News Reader).  Slnr is intended
as a SOUP reader for non-UNIX machines so the port includes a few
modifications to make it more consistant with the UNIX paradigm.  No
advanced features, such as kill-files, are available and you should,
if possible, use news-readers such as `trn' to read your news.
