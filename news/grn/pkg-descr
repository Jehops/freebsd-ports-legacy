Grn is NNTP client which is written with the help of Gnome and Gtk. It is
designed primarily to look like tin as much as possible, but work under X, and
use all the advantages that Gnome and Gtk provide. It is written also under the
influence of FleetStreet - an FTN-compatible message editor for OS/2
Presentation Manager. 

Grn also uses pthreads to allow the user to interact with the program during
different time-consuming tasks (such as fetching grouplist or threading
articles - these all run in another thread).
