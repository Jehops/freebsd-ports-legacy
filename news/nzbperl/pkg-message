================================================================

NOTE:
	Nzbperl prefers a threaded perl, which FreeBSD does not
ship with. Either lang/perl5.8 has to be compiled with 
WITH_THREADS=1 or nzbperl must be run with -dthreadct=0. Note
that nzbperl will pause downloading while each file part is
decoded if a threaded perl is not used.
