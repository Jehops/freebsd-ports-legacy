ubh - the Usenet Binary Harvester - is a GPL'ed Perl console application
which automatically discovers, downloads, and decodes single-part and
multi-part Usenet binaries. Automatically assembles multi-part binaries.
Provides searching via Perl regular expression syntax. Also provides a
pre-selection capability whereby the user can interactively choose which
binaries to download. Uses a standard .newsrc file to control which groups
to process, and uses the .newsrc to keep track of articles already processed.
Handles uuencoded binaries and MIME attachments. Runs under Unix-based Perl
or Active Perl on Win32 platforms. Requires Net::NNTP and News::Newsrc
(which itself requires Set::IntSpan).
