Slurp is an advanced passive NNTP client for UNIX. It will connect to a
remote NNTP server and retrieve articles in a specified set of Usenet
newsgroups that have arrived after a particular date (typically the
last time it was invoked) for processing by your local news system or
forwarding on via UUCP to another news system. It replaces nntpxfer
from the NNTP 1.5.12 reference implementation and nntpget from the INN
distribution.

Patches from Peter Fox (fox@roestock.demon.co.uk) have been added to
avoid downloading articles from certain sites.  To make use of this
facility, create a file ${PREFIX}/news/lib/excludesites and list the
sites in it, eg

fritter.spam.com
hackers.org
