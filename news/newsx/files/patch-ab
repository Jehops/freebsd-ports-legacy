+WORKAROUNDS
+===========
 
+1) `dbx newsx' complains of a symbol table problem and won't run
 
+   Apparently, `gcc -g' can produce things dbx can't handle.  This has been
+   seen in dbz/dbz-v3.o, dbz/dbz.o, and dbz/hash.o.  Recompile the file
+   without the "-g" option and relink newsx.  E.g., if dbx complains about
+   dbz/dbz.o, edit dbz/Makefile to remove "-g " from CFLAGS,
+   `rm dbz/dbz.o src/newsx', and rerun `make'.
