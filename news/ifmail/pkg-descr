This is a README file for ifmail - another Internet/FidoNet gateway and
transport package.

You may do virtually what you wish with this software, as long as the
explicit reference to its original author is retained:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS AND COME WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

This is freeware.  Except for the modules taken from the other packages,
(which may be subject to different distributing policy), you may use
this software for any purpose, commercial or noncommercial, including
even selling it, without paying anything.  Though, if you are willing to
support my efforts, your contribution will be appreciated.  Contact me
by e-mail.

The package consists of two major parts: ifgate (gateway programs,
analog of FidoNet tosser/packer), and ifcico (transport agent, analog of
FidoNet mailer), each in its own subdirectory.  Routines common to these
programs are in the iflib subdirectory.  In the top-level subdirectory
are: README (this file), CONFIG (your system configuration definition)
and top-level Makefile.  There is also a "misc" subdirectory with
examples of configuration, some useful scripts, FAQ list etc.

Each of the subdirectories (ifgate, ifcico, iflib and misc) contains its
own README file, refer to them for more technical details.

To install the package, edit the CONFIG file to match your configuration
and run "make" and (if you are satisfied) "make install".

Currently, the package should be considered BETA, use it on your own
risk.

There is a mailing list for ifmail-related discussions.  To subscribe,
send mail to: <ifmail-request@fidogate.nuars.nwu.edu> (this is a live
person, not a listserv program).  It is supposed that it will carry
latest updates in addition to discussions, so you may wish to subscribe,
to be on the bleeding edge.  Special thanks to H. Peter Anvin for
maintaining this list.
