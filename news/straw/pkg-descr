Straw is a desktop news aggregator for the GNOME environment. Its aim is
to be a faster, easier and more accessible way to read news and blogs
than the traditional browser.

News aggregators read news, weblog or other feeds over the web and
aggregate them so the news items are readable from a single place,
regardless of their source. The data format aggregators utilize
to do their job is called RSS, standing either for Really Simple
Syndication or RDF Site Summary, depending on who you ask. At the
moment, there are two different, incompatible specifications, with
different objectives: RSS 0.9x/RSS 2.0 and RSS 1.0. Straw supports both
of them.
