	vnlpr is a shell script that utilizes the vnpstext and vn7to8
utilities to print vietnames text on PostScript printer on Unix machines
using various Type-1 fonts supplied by TriChlor and the Courier fonts 
from the vnpstext package.

	The Type-1 font files are converted from the pfb files.

	am_11.gsf	A'nh Minh font      (Optima)
	hm_11.gsf	Heo May font        (Helvetica)
	hy_11.gsf	Hoa`ng Ye^'n font   (Present Script)
	mq_11.gsf	Minh Qua^n font     (Courier)
	pt_11.gsf	Phu+o+ng Tha?o font (Brush Script)
	th_11.gsf	Tha Hu+o+ng font    (Chancery)
	uh_11.gsf	U Hoa`i font        (Utopia)

	These fonts can also be used with the ghostscript package for
conversion of PostScript file into other printer formats.

	The .gsf files should be placed at the same place as the initialization
files for the vnpstext package.

        pr_am.ps, pr_hm.ps, pr_hy.ps, pr_mq.ps, pr_pt.ps, pr_th.ps and
pr_uh.ps are PostScript files that show the above font types.

	Instruction for using the vnlpr script is in the begining of the
script, and also by typing 'vnlpr -h' will show a description of the
usage also.
You'll need to edit the VNLIB environment variable in vnlpr so it point
to this directory that contains the .gsf files. You must also install 
vnpstext first.

        For example:

   vnlpr -mq -s 8 emtoi
                      This print emtoi using MinhQua^n size 8

   vnlpr -uh -s 10 -i emtoi
                      This print emtoi using U Hoa`i Italic size 10


	Read the INSTALL file for installation procedure.

- Happy printing -
