Tha^n cha`o ca'c ba.n,

vnxterm is a xterm replacement with Vietnamese VIQR 1.1 (7-bit VIetnamese
Quoted Readable/Viet-Net, RFC 1456) support.  This version of vnterm is
derived from the X11R6.5.1 xterm, and thus has simular capabilities.

Please see the README file in the share/doc/vnterm directory.

	Note, if you are a new user, or not quite understand X resources or
	X font paths, etc., simply use the command "VNterm".
