    Vnpstext converts your 8-bit Vietnamese text to a PostScript
    file suitable for printing to a PostScript printer.  To use it
    you need to have an 8-bit Vietnamese text file, which may be
    created with an editor like Vnelvis, or converted from Viet-Std
    7-bit (quoted-readable) format using Vn7to8.
