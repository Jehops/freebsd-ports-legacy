Formosa is a Ruby library for processing Taiwanese languages. Major languages
spoken in Taiwan include Holo, Hakka, Mandarin and those of the indigenous
people. Formosa is the Ruby branch of the lib-formosa project
(http://code.google.com/p/lib-formosa/).

Currently, we focus on the processing of the Holo (Southern Min) language,
with necessary tools such as SyllableComposer available for general use.
