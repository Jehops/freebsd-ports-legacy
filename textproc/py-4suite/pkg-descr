4Suite is a collection of Python tools for XML processing and object data
management, published by Fourthought, Inc under an open source licence.

The suite provides support for XML parsing, several transient and persistent
DOM implementations, XPath expressions, XPointer, XSLT transforms, XLink, RDF
and ODMG object databases.

The development of 4Suite is closely coordinated with that of the publicly
developed PyXML extension for Python.  4Suite is not intended to replace
PyXML, but rather to augment it with additional functionality.  As certain
parts of 4Suite reach maturity they will be transferred to PyXML (this has
already happened with the 4DOM implementation of the DOM API).  Eventually
PyXML will be a complete and stable toolkit, while 4Suite will continue to
provide bleeding edge (re)implementations.

The user of Python 2.0 and later therefore now has three options for XML
processing:  the built-in 'xml' package, PyXML, and 4Suite.  PyXML overrides
and/or extends the 'xml' package, and 4Suite does the same for PyXML.
