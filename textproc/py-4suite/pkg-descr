 * Ft.Xml.Xslt: A robust XSLT 1.0 processor.
 * Ft.Xml.XUpdate: An XUpdate processor.
 * Ft.Rdf: RDF processing tools, including a query/inference language.
 * Ft.Server: An integrated document & RDF repository with web access.
 * Ft.Lib: Various support libraries that can be used independently.

4Suite also includes convenient command-line tools:
 * 4xml: XML document parsing and reserialization.
 * 4xpath: XPath expression evaluation.
 * 4xslt: XSLT processing.
 * 4xupdate: XUpdate processing.
 * 4rdf: RDF/XML parsing, persistence, querying and reserialization.
