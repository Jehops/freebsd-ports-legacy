#
# Installation rationale and compromises
#
# * fxp applications are installed
#   sml-nj: script + heap file, sml-nj-devel/mlton: binary
#
# * fxp source code is installed
#   Making this optional would further complicate the port.
#   The porter currently believes that fxp is of primary interest to sml
#   developers. He is willing to consider otherwise.
#
# * source code for Apps is not installed
#   The Apps do not belong to the library proper (but they are useful as
#   examples).
#
# * a single cm library file is installed (if stabilization occurs)
#   for efficient operation of library consumers written in SML/NJ.
#   The other .cm file and directories would make recompilation faster,
#   but are otherwise unnecessary.
#
# Note: reinstallation of SML/NJ seems to require restabilisation of
#       libraries.
