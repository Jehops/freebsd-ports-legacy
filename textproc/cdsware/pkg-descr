The CERN Document Server Software (CDSware) allows you to run your own
electronic preprint server, your own online library catalogue or a document
system on the web.

It complies with the Open Archives Initiative metadata harvesting protocol
(OAI-PMH) and uses MARC 21 as its underlying bibliographic standard.
