The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML, but
introduces a more general approach for processing XML with Haskell. The
Haskell XML Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML
documents, including the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell.
It contains a validating XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support,
an XPath expression evaluator, an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema
validator and funtions for serialization and deserialization of user
defined data. The library make extensive use of the arrow approach for
processing XML. Since version 8.5 XPath and XSLT have been moved to
separate packages hxt-xpath and hxt-xslt.
