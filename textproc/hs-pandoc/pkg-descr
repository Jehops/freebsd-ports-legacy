Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library.  It can read
markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, DocBook,
MediaWiki markup, and Textile, and it can write markdown,
reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Docbook, OpenDocument, ODT, Word
docx, RTF, MediaWiki, Textile, groff man pages, plain text, Emacs
Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, EPUB (v2 and v3), FictionBook2, and S5, Slidy and
Slideous HTML slide shows.  Pandoc extends standard markdown syntax with
footnotes, embedded LaTeX, definition lists, tables, and other features.
A compatibility mode is provided for those who need a drop-in
replacement for Markdown.pl.  In contrast to existing tools for
converting markdown to HTML, which use regex substitutions, pandoc has a
modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse text in a
given format and produce a native representation of the document, and a
set of writers, which convert this native representation into a target
format.  Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a
reader or writer.
