Warning: Upgrading from Aspell .33/Pspell .12

The way dictionaries are handled has also changed. This includes a change
in the naming conventions of both language names and dictionaries. Due to
the language name change, your old personal dictionaries will not be
recognized. However, you can import the old dictionaries by running the
"aspell-import" script. This also means that dictionaries designed to
work with older versions of Aspell are not likely to function correctly.
Fortunately new dictionary packages are available for most languages. You
can find them off of the Aspell home page at http://aspell.net.

The Pspell ABI is now part of Aspell except that the name of everything
has changed due to the renaming of Pspell to Aspell. In particular please
note the following name changes:

    pspell -> aspell
    manager -> speller
    emulation -> enumeration
    master_word_list -> main_word_list

Please also note that the name of the language-tag option has changed to 
lang. However, for backward compatible the language-tag option will still
work.
