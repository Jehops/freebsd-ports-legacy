OpenVanilla (OV) is an input method (IM)/output filter (OF) framework
designed for better end-user text processing experiences. For example,
OpenVanilla provides a comprehensive set of Traditional Chinese input
methods that are lacking or of which counterparts are functionally
deficient/unsatisfactory in Apple's Mac OS X. Many Simplified Chinese
users also find this framework useful. A Tibetan IM module is also
available.

openvanilla-modules installs the input method modules for OpenVanilla.
The SCIM OpenVanilla loader does not currently support output filters.
