Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability to
read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents.

The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability.
Source code, samples and API documentation are provided with the parser.
For portability, care has been taken to make minimal use of templates,
no RTTI, no C++ namespaces and minimal use of #ifdefs.
