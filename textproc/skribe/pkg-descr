Skribe is a text processor.  Even if it is a general purpose tool, it
best suits the writing of technical documents such as web pages or
technical reports, API documentations, etc.  At first glance, Skribe
looks like a mark-up language ala HTML.  So, there is no need to be
provided with computer programming skills in order to use Skribe.

A second look reveals that Skribe is actually a true programming
language, provided with high level features (such as objects, higher
order functions, regular and syntactic parsing, etc.).  Skribe is
based on the Scheme programming language.
