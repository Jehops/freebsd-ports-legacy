This module is a substitution for Text::Wrap, supporting
multibyte characters such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, and GB2312, fullwidth
characters such as east Asian characters, combining characters
such as diacritical marks and Thai, and languages which don't
use whitespaces between words such as Chinese and Japanese.
