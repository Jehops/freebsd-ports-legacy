In summary, this module provides a strong (IMO) base for working with PDF
files but lacks some finesse. Users should know their way around the PDF
specification.

FEATURES
   - Works with more than one PDF file open at once
   - Supports TrueType fonts as well as the base 14 (requires Font::TTF module)
     including Type0 glyph based fonts (for Unicode), and subsetting
