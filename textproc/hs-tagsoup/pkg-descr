TagSoup is a Haskell library for extracting information out of
unstructured HTML code, sometimes known as tag-soup. The HTML does not
have to be well formed, or render properly within any particular
framework.  This library is for situations where the author of the HTML
is not cooperating with the person trying to extract the information, but
is also not trying to hide the information.
