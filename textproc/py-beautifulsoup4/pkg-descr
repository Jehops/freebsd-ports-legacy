Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like
screen-scraping.

Three features make it powerful:

1. Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for
navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting
a document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write
an application.
2. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and
outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless
the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't detect one.
Then you just have to specify the original encoding.
3. Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib,
allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
flexibility.
