From the README:
 XML package v0.5.1

 This is the third test release of the Python XML package.  The
 distribution contains a validating XML parser, an implementation of
 the SAX and DOM programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat
 parser (and the Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can
 speed up xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!
