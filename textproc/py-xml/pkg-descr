This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

The current version is still to be considered a beta release.
