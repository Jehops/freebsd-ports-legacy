From the README:
  This is the Python XML package.  The distribution contains a
  validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM
  programming interfaces, an interface to the Expat parser (and the
  Expat parser itself), and a C helper module that can speed up
  xmllib.py by a factor of 5.  There's even documentation!

Version 0.6.3 is to be considered a beta release.
