RDoc is a documentation tool for Ruby source files.  It understands
Ruby syntax, and automatically extracts class, module, method, and
attribute definitions, building a structured set of HTML ages
documenting your programs.  It also extracts any comment block
associated with program elements, formatting these using a natural
markup scheme (the intent being that the source code should not have
to have too much extra annotation when used by RDoc).
