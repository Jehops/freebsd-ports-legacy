The Xerces Java Parser supports XML 1.0 recommendation and contains advanced
parser functionality, such as XML Schema, DOM Level 2 version 1.0, and SAX
Version 2, in addition to supporting the industry-standard DOM Level 1 and SAX
version 1 APIs.

Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance, fully compliant XML parsers
in the Apache Xerces family. This version of Xerces introduces the Xerces
Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and
configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface.

Xerces2 also provides an experimental implementation of the Document Object
Model Level 3 Core and Load/Save Proposed Recommendations and provides a
partial implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Working Draft in
Last Call. It also provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs.
