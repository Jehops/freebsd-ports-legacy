	The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system is not
meant to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search systems
like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant
to cover the search needs for a single company, campus, or even a
particular sub section of a web site. 

   As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search engines,
ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site. The type of these
different web servers doesn't matter as long as they understand the
HTTP 1.0 protocol.
