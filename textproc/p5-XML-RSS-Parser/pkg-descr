XML::RSS::Parser is a lightweight liberal parser of RSS feeds that is derived 
from the XML::Parser::LP module the I developed for mt-rssfeed -- a 
MovableType plugin. This parser is "liberal" in that it does not demand 
compliance to a specific RSS version and will attempt to gracefully handle 
tags it does not expect or understand. The parser's only requirement is that 
the file is well-formed XML. The module is leaner then XML::RSS -- the majority 
of code was for generating RSS files.
