The object constructor takes a 'spellcommand' argument. This has to be 
some ispell compatible program, like aspell. Optionally, it also takes a 
color to highlight mispelled words. 

The only method on the object is check_html, which takes a reference to 
the text to check and returns a bunch of HTML highlighting misspellings 
and showing suggestions. If it returns nothing, then there no misspellings 
found.
