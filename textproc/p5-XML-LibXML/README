This module is a minimal interface to the Gnome libxml2 library which you
can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/

Currently this is just a helper module for XML::LibXSLT (and as such is
included with the XML::LibXSLT distribution), but libxml2 has a full DOM
API, and so I hope to be able to offer full access to that API one day.

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself. Copyright 2001 AxKit.com Ltd, All rights reserved.
