tools for helping translation of documentation

The po4a (po for anything) project goal is to ease translations
(and more interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using
gettext tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

This package contains the main libraries of po4a, and the following sub-modules:

  - KernelHelp: Help messages of each kernel compilation option.
  - Man: Good old manual page format.
  - Pod: Perl documentation format.
  - Sgml: either debiandoc or docbook DTD.
  - Dia: uncompressed Dia diagrams.
  - LaTeX: generic TeX or LaTeX format
