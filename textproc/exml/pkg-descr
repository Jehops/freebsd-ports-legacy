EXML is an abstracted, generalized interface to an xml parser/writer, using
ecore data structures and making things generally easy to get around in.

The functions detailed in EXML.h are fairly self explanatory, and the io
interfaces are also generalized and independent (open from a socket, write
to in memory xml image).
