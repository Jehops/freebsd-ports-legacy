FormValidator is a port of Perl's Data::FormValidator library.  It
makes it easy to validate data coming in from HTML forms and provides
a robust set of methods to handle dependent fields, filtering data,
constraints, etc.  It's modular design allows you to easily add your
own filters and constraints and also allows you to keep validation
profiles outside of your CGI scripts.
