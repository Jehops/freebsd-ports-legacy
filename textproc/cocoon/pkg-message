Cocoon is now installed in %%APP_HOME%%

You may want to start it by issuing `%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/%%APP_NAME%%.sh start'
and then point your web browser to the default home page at http://localhost:%%PORT%%/ to read
the documentation and test the samples.

If you wish to start Cocoon automatically at boot time, add the following line
to /etc/rc.conf:

%%APP_NAME%%_enable="YES"
