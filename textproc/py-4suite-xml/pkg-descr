4Suite XML is part of 4Suite, a suite of Python modules for XML and RDF
processing. 4Suite XML's major components include the following:

 * Ft.Xml.Domlette: A very fast, lightweight XPath-oriented DOM.
 * Ft.Xml.Sax: A very fast SAX 2 parser.
 * Ft.Xml.XPath: An XPath 1.0 implementation for Domlette documents.
 * Ft.Xml.Xslt: A robust XSLT 1.0 processor.
 * Ft.Xml.XUpdate: An XUpdate processor.
 * Ft.Lib: Various support libraries that can be used independently.

4Suite XML also includes convenient command-line tools:

 * 4xml: XML document parsing and reserialization.
 * 4xpath: XPath expression evaluation.
 * 4xslt: XSLT processing.
 * 4xupdate: XUpdate processing.

Separate add-on packages to add RDF and document repository features
are forthcoming.  If you need those features now, use the monolithic
py-4suite package instead of this one.
