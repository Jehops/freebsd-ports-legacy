Common API for XML Pull Parsing (XmlPull) is an effort to define a simple and
elegant pull parsing API that will provide a standardized way to do pull XML
parsing from J2ME to J2EE.

It is a minimalist API: very easy to implement standalone or on top of existing
parser. The API allows both fast high level iteration (using next() method) and
low level tokenizing (using nextToken() token) and is designed for easy
building on top of it SAX, XML pull parsers that uses iterators with event
objects, or even DOM implementations. To support J2ME and real small
implementation parsing of DOCDECL is optional (but DOCDECL can be reported if
requested).

The aim is to provide a similar but orthogonal pull parsing basis to widely
successful push parsing SAX API. The XmlPull API is in public domain in hope
that it will be embraced by Java developers (conformance tests are under LGPL
license to minimize risk of incompatible implementations).
