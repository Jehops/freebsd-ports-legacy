XML Catalog Manager (xmlcatmgr in its short form) is a small utility
used to manipulate SGML and XML catalogs. It is extremely small and
lightweight, requiring no more dependancies than an awk and a shell
interpreter. Basically, it allows adding and removing entries from
catalogs, in a completely automated way.
