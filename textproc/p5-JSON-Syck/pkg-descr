You might want to know the difference between JSON and JSON::Syck.

Since JSON is a pure-perl module and JSON::Syck is based on libsyck,
JSON::Syck is supposed to be very fast and memory efficient. See
chansen's benchmark table at
http://idisk.mac.com/christian.hansen/Public/perl/serialize.pl

JSON.pm comes with dozens of ways to do the same thing and lots of
options, while JSON::Syck doesn't. There's only Load and Dump.

Oh, and JSON::Syck doesn't use camelCase method names :-)
