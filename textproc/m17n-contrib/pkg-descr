This port installs the user-contributed input methods for the m17n library
(the official ones are installed through devel/m17n-lib). It currently
supports Punjabi, Sinhala, Telugu, Nepali, Russian, Assamese, Bengali,
Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya and Vietnamese layouts
with various sub-variants.

The port also provides the tbl2mim.awk script for conversion of keyboard
files used by textproc/scim-table-imengine into SCIM-independent .mim format
(usable by m17n library).
