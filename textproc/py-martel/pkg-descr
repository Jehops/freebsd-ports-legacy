Martel is a parser generator, written in Python, which takes a regular
expression grammer for a file format and turns the resultant parsed tree into
a set of callback events emulating the XML/SAX API.

Essentially this means that existing and readily available XML tools can be
used to parse non-XML flat file formats.

Martel was originally intended for use in biocomputing applications (such as
Biopython - http://www.biopython.org/) where there is often a need to parse
flat and semi-structured legacy file formats.  However, it is generally
applicable to the parsing of such files in all fields of endeavour.
