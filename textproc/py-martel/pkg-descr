Martel is a parser generator, written in Python, which takes a regular
expression grammer for a format and turns the resultant parsed tree into a
set of callback events emulating the XML/SAX API.

It was originally intended for use in biocomputing applications (such as
Biopython - http://www.biopython.org/), where there is often a need to parse
existing flat and semi-structured file formats.  However, it is generally
applicable to the parsing of such files in all fields of endeavour.
