Ebnf2ps generates nice looking syntax diagrams in EPS and FIG format from
EBNF specifications and from yacc, bison, and Happy input grammars. The
diagrams can be immediately included in TeX/LaTeX documents and in texts
created with other popular document preparation systems.

Ebnf2ps is written in Haskell98, a lazy functional programming language.
