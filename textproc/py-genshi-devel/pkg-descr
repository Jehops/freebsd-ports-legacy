Genshi is a Python library that provides an integrated set of components
for parsing, generating, and processing HTML, XML or other textual content
for output generation on the web. The major feature is a template language,
which is heavily inspired by Kid. 

The development version 0.6 has the following features:

* Improved XPath engine.

* Code generation instead of AST transformation for template expressions.

* Use of Python _ast module as an alternative to the deprecated compiler
* package.

* Full support for advanced internationalization.

* Drop Python 2.3 compatibility, Python 2.4 will be the minimum required
* version.
