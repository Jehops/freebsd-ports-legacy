NLTK-Lite is a new collection of lightweight NLP modules designed for 
maximum simplicity and efficiency. NLTK-Lite only covers the simple 
variants of standard data structures and tasks. Simplicity and 
efficiency are valued over generality and extensibility.

NLTK-Lite is primarily intended to facilitate teaching NLP to students 
having limited programming experience. The focus is on teaching Python
together with the help of NLP recipes, instead of teaching students to
use a large set of specialized classes that lock them in to using NLTK.
