Support code for editing reStructuredText with Emacs.

Basically, this package contains:

- Functions to automatically adjust and cycle the section underline
  decorations;
- A mode that displays the table of contents and allows you to jump anywhere
  from it;
- Functions to insert and automatically update a TOC in your source
  document;
- A mode which supports font-lock highlighting of reStructuredText
  structures;
- Some other convenience functions.

This package is the result of merging:

- restructuredtext.el
- rst-mode.el
- rst-html.el

Those files are now OBSOLETE and have been replaced by this single
package file (2005-10-30).
