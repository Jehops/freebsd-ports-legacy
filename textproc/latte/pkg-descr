Latte is a simple language for marking up text in a very expressive
way.  This distribution includes the Latte library, which allows you
to build translators from Latte to any other text format you choose,
and a demonstration application that converts Latte text into HTML,
allowing you to write web pages in a much saner language than HTML.
