This module generates SAX events from SQL queries against a DBI
connection.

It is a replacement for the outdated DBIx::XML_RDB module.  Unlike
DBIx::XML_RDB, it does not create a string directly, instead you have to
use some sort of SAX handler module.  If you wish to create a string or
write to a file, use YAWriter.  Alternatively you might want to generate
a DOM tree or XML::XPath tree, which you can do with either of those
module's SAX handlers (known as Builders in those distributions).
