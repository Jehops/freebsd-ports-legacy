XSL is a language for expressing stylesheets. It consists of two parts:

   1.  XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML
     documents, and
   2.  an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics (called
     Formatting Objects).

The Lotus XSL Processor implements only the first part of XSL, the April 21
XSL Transformations (XSLT) Draft Specification.

An XSLT stylesheet specifies the transformation of a class of XML documents
by describing how an instance of the class is transformed into another XML
tree of nodes.

LotusXSL uses Version 1.1.16 or 2.0.9 of IBM's XML for Java (called "XML4J")
to parse an input XML document, or it can be adapted to other DOM-producing
mechanisms. LotusXSL produces SAX events, an output DOM, or XML result
document based on the transformations specified in the XSL stylesheet.
