This is FriBidi, a Free Implementation of the Unicode BiDi algorithm.

Background
==========
One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in
Israel is the lack of support for Hebrew. In order to have proper
Hebrew support, the BiDi algorithm must be implemented. It is my hope
that this library will stimulate more Hebrew free software.

Of course the BiDi algorithm is not limited to Hebrew, so I expect
that our Arab neighbors will also find this software useful.

Audience
========

It is my hope that this library will stimulate the implementation of
Hebrew and Arabic in lots of free software. Here is a small list of
projects that would benifit from the use of the FriBidi library, but
of course there are many more: Wine, Mozilla, Gtk, Gnome, Qt, KDE,
AbiWord, lynx.
