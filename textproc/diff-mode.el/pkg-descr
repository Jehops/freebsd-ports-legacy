Diff-mode is a major-mode for viewing/editing context diffs in Emacs.
Supports unified and context diffs as well as (to a lesser extent)
normal diffs.

The diff-mode provides features such as:

    - Unified diff <-> Context diff conversion.
    - Reverse the direction of the diffs.
    - Jump to the corresponding source line.
    - Move to the next/previous hunk/file header.
    - Restrict the view to the current hunk/file.
