From the opensched home page:

  OPENSCHED is a project scheduler. It reads a project description file,
  which contains information about:

	Tasks which must be accomplished. 
	Resources (e.g., people, equipment, facilities) which may work
        on tasks.
	Work that has already been completed. 

  It schedules resources to work on tasks, and produces various reports: 

	A summary of all tasks and task dependencies. 
	A work schedule for the entire project. 
	A work schedule for each resource. 
	GANTT charts. 
	Weekly and monthly work summaries for each resource. 

  These reports are typeset using LaTeX, for display or printing.
