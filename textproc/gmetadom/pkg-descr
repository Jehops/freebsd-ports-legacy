GMetaDOM is a collection of librares, each library providing a DOM
implementation. Currently available bindings are for C++ (smart pointers)
and Objective Caml.

The basic idea is that, given the availability of DOM implementations for
the C programming language (like Gdome2), and given the uniformity of the
DOM interfaces, bindings for various programming languages based on the C
implementation can be built automatically, providing a small number of hand-
coded classes and a set of scripts for the automatic generation of the
remaining ones.

Furthermore, since a XML description of the DOM interfaces is provided as
part of the documentation in the W3C DOM specification, GMetaDOM adopts XSLT
as the transformation language for the automatic generation of the interfaces,
and uses the xsltproc utility as the XSLT processor.

The advantages of such approach should be evident. In particular, for
languages like C++ where a number of different alternative DOM implementations
are feasible, each with different characteristics like easiness of use,
runtime flexibility, resource requirements, the approach of automatic
generation permits to create a set of coherent implementations addressing
such issues separately, ultimately allowing the developer to choose the
library which fits best her needs.
