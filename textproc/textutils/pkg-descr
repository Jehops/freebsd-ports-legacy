GNU text utilities

The Free Software Foundation's text processing utilities, for rearranging,
reformatting and generally mangling text.

Many of the utilities exist in the FreeBSD base collection, but the GNU
versions have added functionality, which is sometimes useful.

Note that the texinfo documentation refers to these utilities
without the "g" prefix (cat rather than gcat, etc.).
