This library provides an engine to interpret compiled
(textproc/kmflcomp) KMFL keyboard tables written in Keyman keyboard
language for use with SCIM KMFL IMEngine
(textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine).

KMFL aims to bring Tavultesoft Keyman functionality to *nix operating
systems. KMFL is being jointly developed by SIL International
(http://www.sil.org) and Tavultesoft (http://www.tavultesoft.com).
