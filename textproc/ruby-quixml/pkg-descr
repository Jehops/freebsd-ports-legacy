QuiXML is an XML library for Ruby written in C, utilizing the expat
library for parsing XML string buffers.  It uses only Ruby native data
structures to store its XML data internally, so how they are generated
is completely open.  The library both parses and generates XML,
precisely or with pretty printing and automatic encoding/decoding
special characters (<, >, &, ', and ").  Transmutations to/from
attribute string values and Ruby objects can occur when
reading/writing XML, allowing for a limited degree of object
marshalling.  Element path addressing makes it easy to find one or
more nodes using literal strings, regular expressions or any other
object which supports Ruby case-equality to match against XML node
names and attributes.
