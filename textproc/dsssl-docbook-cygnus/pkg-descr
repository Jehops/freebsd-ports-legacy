This is the DocBook DSSSL stylesheets of Cygnus Slution which based on Norman
Walsh's DocBook style sheets with version 1.44. This package contains print
style sheet (bosak-db3.dsl), HTML style sheet (dbtohtml.dsl) and
both (cygnus-both.dsl). These dsls refer including Walsh's DocBook style
sheets in default but these ones are too obsoleted so I changed to
ports-current ones (dsssl-docbook-modular). For more infomation see below:
