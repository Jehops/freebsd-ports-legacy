MXP1 is a new XmlPull parsing engine that is based on ideas from XPP and in
particular XPP2 but completely revised and rewritten to take best advantage of
latest Java JIT JVMs such as Hotspot in JDK 1.4.

MXP1 has following features:

  - fast - let me say it again it is fast :-)
  - small - lot of performance packed in JAR file that is less than 20KB!
  - easy to use - the parser implements common XML pull parsing API (XMLPULL)
    described at http://www.xmlpull.org

Performance tests that compare MXP1 to other leading XML parsers are available
