This is a program for viewing MS Word documents.  It produces plain
text output and can optionally convert non-standard characters into 
TeX control sequences.  It works with MS Word 97 documents.

There is also a cute little Tcl/Tk program included called wordview, which
is basically a small GUI frontend to catdoc for viewing word documents.
The wordview program works with Tcl 7.6 and up, but uses Tk 8.0 by default.

There are two more utilities, xls2csv and xlsview, for dealing with
MS Excel spreadsheets.  xls2csv converts an Excel spreadsheet to a plain
text file with CSV (comma-separated values) lines.
