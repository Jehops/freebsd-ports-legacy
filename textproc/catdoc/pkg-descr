This is a program for viewing MS Word documents.  It produces plain
text output, and can optionally convert non-standard characters into 
TeX control sequences.

There is also a cute little tk program included called wordview, which
is basically a small GUI frontend to catdoc for viewing word documents.
You'll need TK 4.2 (in /usr/ports/x11/tk42) to use this.
