This is a program for viewing MS Word documents.  It produces plain
text output and can optionally convert non-standard characters into 
TeX control sequences.  It works with MS Word 97 documents.

There is also a cute little Tcl/Tk program included called wordview, which
is basically a small GUI frontend to catdoc for viewing word documents.
The wordview program works with Tcl 7.6 and up, but uses Tk 8.0 by default.
