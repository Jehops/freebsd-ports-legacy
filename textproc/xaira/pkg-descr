Xaira is an XML Aware Indexing and Retrieval Application 
designed to allow fast access to large corpora marked up 
in XML.

Xaira is the current name for a new version of SARA, the text 
searching software originally developed at OUCS for use with 
the British National Corpus. 

This new version has been entirely re-written as a general 
purpose XML search engine, which will operate on any corpus 
of well-formed XML documents. It is however best used with 
TEI-conformant documents.

Xaira has full Unicode support. This means you can use it to 
search and display text in any language, provided you have a 
suitable Unicode font installed on your system.
