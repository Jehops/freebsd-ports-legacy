c2html is  a  syntax highlighter for C   source  code that produces  a
highlighted html   file as  output. The output   can  be  read by  any
graphical WWW-Browser.  If the  browser understands the tags to change
font colors  (as Netscape does) the  output will look like highlighted
by emacs.  Otherwise it will  not look  so   nice, but readability  is
increased too.

c2html can also work as a  CGI program and convert your sources on the
fly.   To use  in this  way  copy it  to your  /cgi-bin directory  and
configure  your webserver to  call c2html  for *.c  and *.h  files. An
example that works with Apache is described in the manpage.
