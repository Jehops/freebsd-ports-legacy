A simple converter from OpenDocument Text to plain text

 * small (size of binary is 25 KB on Linux/i386)
 * fast (no xml parser involved)
 * supports multiple output encodings, adopts to your locale
 * can substitute common characters which the output charset does not
   contain with ascii look-alikes
 * portable (runs on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Windows, Cygwin)
 * mostly self-contained (only requirements are a POSIX-compatible regex
   library and an iconv implementation)
 * license: GPL, version 2
