NICETEXT - is a package that converts any file into pseudo- 
natural-language text.  It also can recover the original file 
from the text!  

The expandable set of tools allows experimentation with custom dictionaries, 
automatic simulation of writing style, and the use of Context-Free-Grammars
to control text generation.

It is the result of Masters Thesis research at the University of 
Wisconsin, Milwaukee under the advisement of Dr. George Davida.  

The concepts were publicly presented at the International Conference 
on Information and Computer Security 1997 (ICICS97) in Beijing, 
China back in November, 1997.
