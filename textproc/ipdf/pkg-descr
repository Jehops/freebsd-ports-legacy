Creates indexed pdf documents from text files. Designed to aid creating an
electronic distribution method for legacy system reports, since many
mainframe type print spools are plain text. Allows indexing, customizing
page settings, font size, font face, and super-imposing text over an image
in the case of using pre-printed forms. Supports unlimited levels of indexing
bookmarks in documents and system/user configuration files. Suitable for
use in an intranet gateway for generating PDF documents in real-time.
