A variety of alternative parser combinator libraries for the functional
programming language Haskell, including the original HuttonMeijer set.
The Poly sets have features like good error reporting, arbitrary token
type, running state, lazy parsing, and so on.  Finally, Text.Parse is a
proposed replacement for the standard Read class, for better
deserialisation of Haskell values from Strings.
