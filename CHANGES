Updating Information for FreeBSD ports developers

This file is maintained by Erwin Lansing <erwin@FreeBSD.org> and
copyrighted by the FreeBSD Foundation.

This file contains major changes to ports and the ports infrastructure.
Intended audience are ports committers, maintainers and other
developers. User oriented changes should be submitted for inclusion
in the release notes.

All ports committers are allowed to commit to this file.

20040304:
	New variable MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE_EXTENDED. It has the
	ten official sourceforge.net download mirrors, whereas
	MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE only has five. To check if your
	port is mirrored there, go to
	<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/${MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR}/>
	click on ${DISTFILES} and you'll see five or ten mirrors,
	corresponding to the variables above.

20040226:
	The default version of Ruby is now 1.8 on all platforms
	including the i386.

	Users on the i386 platform need to follow the instructions
	described in the UPDATING file to cope with this upgrade.

	Next time ruby is major upgraded, you won't need to do this
	kind of messy work because some subtle changes have been made
	to the ruby port infrastructure to make it easier to handle
	multiple versions of ruby.

20040217:
	Mozilla will now default to using GTK2, and will only compile
	against Gtk+-1.2 if explicitly requested.  This is in exact
	opposite to the old behaviour.

	The valid values of WITH_MOZILLA are now:
		mozilla			(www/mozilla, GTK2)
		mozilla-devel		(www/mozilla-devel, GTK2)
		mozilla-gtk1		(www/mozilla-gtk1, GTK1)
		mozilla-devel-gtk1	(www/mozilla-devel-gtk1, GTK1)
	
	As before, WITH_MOZILLA can be set in /etc/make.conf, but doing
	so is not advised unless you desire the development versions.
	GTK2 browsers will automatically compile against GTK2 mozilla,
	and GTK1 browsers (galeon1, galeon1, and galeon1) will
	automatically compile against GTK1.

	Again, the only people who will need to take action are those
	who desire development versions (which are inactive at this time
	anyway).  Those who want GTK1 mozilla-devel must set
	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk1 or they will be pleasantly
	surprised with their very own GTK2 installation on the next
	update.

	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-gtk2 and WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk2
	are still honoured for the time being, but their use is
	now deprecated.  Any new ports are not required to consider
	their values, and so eventually WITH_MOZILLA _will_ have to
	be changed.

	Hopefully galeon2 can catch up to peoples' expectations from
	galeon1 soon, and we can remove the GTK1 ports altogether.

	
20040204:
	The bsd.php.mk file has been moved out of the lang/php4 port
	into the Mk directory.  This will make it much easier to include
	PHP support in PHP-dependent ports.  Instead of including
	bsd.php.mk directly, a port can simply set USE_PHP=yes, and the
	ports system with Do the Right Thing.

	All trailing whitespace has been removed from bsd.port.mk.

	Enhance the new OPTIONS code by only including saved options if
	the port defines OPTIONS, attempt to use LATEST_LINK as the
	unique name for a port (fall back to ${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}
	otherwise), bring the ===> messages in line with the existing
	ones by using PKGNAME instead of PORTNAME, use PKGNAME in the
	dialog, use ECHO_CMD instead of ECHO_MSG to write the
	OPTIONSFILE, display a message during compilation indicating
	that user-specified options have been found, and make the output
	of the showconfig target a little more user-friendly.

	A new USE_ICONV macro has been added that takes the place of an
	explicit LIB_DEPENDS on converters/libiconv.  This will help
	with future shared lib version bumps.

	A new USE_GETTEXT macro has been added that takes the place of
	an explicit LIB_DEPENDS on devel/gettext.  This will help with
	future shared lib version bumps.

	Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing
	Perl modules.  It will eventually replace the obsoleted
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Many new Perl modules have already
	switched to using Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL.  To
	facilitate building those modules, a new PERL_MODBUILD macro has
	been added.  Use that in place of PERL_CONFIGURE when porting
	Perl modules that make use of the Module::Build framework.

	Certain ports want to check for the availability of SDL
	libraries before including them.  This change adds a new
	WANT_SDL macro similar to WANT_GNOME.  By setting this, the
	porter indicates that her port can optional use SDL if present
	on the system.  WANT_SDL should be defined _before_
	bsd.port.pre.mk is included.  After including bsd.port.pre.mk,
	the list of available SDL components will be returned in the
	HAVE_SDL macro.  For details on how to process this component
	list, refer to bsd.sdl.mk.

	The OpenBSD and NetBSD projects diverged from the FreeBSD ports
	tree years ago, and it no longer make sense to include obsolete
	references to incorrect paths in the FreeBSD ports system.  This
	change removes the NetBSD and OpenBSD PORTSDIR compatibility
	bits from bsd.port.mk.

	The comment for PKGDIR read, ``A direction containing any
	package creating file.''  The word ``direction'' should be
	``directory.''  This has been fixed.

	A new DIRNAME macro has been added that points to
	/usr/bin/dirname.  All direct use of dirname in ports can be
	switched to this macro.

	Direct use of commands dirname, id, and rm have been corrected
	to use their macro equivalents instead.  Some useless ${HEAD}
	-n 1 statements have been removed.  A strange comment in the
	do-install target and an out of place ``fi'' have been fixed as
	well.

	On 5-CURRENT after the 5.2-RELEASE split, the default Perl
	version has been updated from 5.6.1 to 5.8.2.  As well, some
	Perl definitions in bsd.port.mk have been moved to their correct
	locations which corrects the PERL_LEVEL definition.

	The following optimizations have been added to the ports system
	to speed up recursive operations such as make describe, make
	index, make ignorelist, etc.  bsd.gnome.mk is now only included
	if a port defines USE_GNOME, WANT_GNOME, and/or USE_GTK.  More
	variables are cached and passed down through bsd.port.subdir.mk.
	Perl is no longer invoked when a simple ``echo'' will do.  More
	subshell variable assignments have been hidden behind
	conditionals so that the commands are not spawned everytime.
	Finally, dependency lists are only constructed if ports actually
	declare dependencies.  These optimizations give make index
	approximately a 43% speedup.

	If CPUFLAGS is not defined (this _CPUCFLAGS is empty), trying
	to remove _CPUCFLAGS from CFLAGS will result in an error.  This
	change fixes that.

	On recent versions of 5.X, /etc/rc.subr exists, and there is no
	reason to install another copy in ${LOCALBASE}/etc.  The reason
	this was ever done was to workaround some build issues on bento.
	However, testing OSVERSION seems to work in spite of those build
	issues.

	The ports system now supports MySQL 3.23, 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0.
	Also, the ability to scale to newer versions was also but in
	place.

	An .endif comment indicated that the .if block checked
	WANT_MYSQL when, in fact, it was checking WANT_MYSQL_VER.  This
	has been corrected.

	The PTHREAD{CFLAGS,LIBS} macros have been made overridable on
	all versions of FreeBSD to allow for alternate threading
	implementations (e.g. -lc_r, -lthr, -mt, etc.).  The default
	threading library has been changed to -lpthread from -lc_r on
	-CURRENT.

	The new SIZE support broke distfiles fetching on FreeBSD < 4.8.
	On those versions of FreeBSD, the SIZE distfile attribute is now
	ignored.  Also, defining DISABLE_SIZE in, for example,
	/etc/make.conf, will ignore the SIZE attribute on all versions
	of FreeBSD.  This is useful with alternate values for FETCH_CMD.

	A new vulnerabilities database has been added to the ports
	system in order to keep more accurate, up-to-date, track of
	security vulnerabilities.  The ports system now knows how to
	query that database and dynamically prevents the installation
	of vulnerable ports.

	In order to allow for more rapid development of the package
	tools, the ports system will prefer to use pkg_* tools found in
	${LOCALBASE} over those in the base system.  However, all PKG_*
	macros are still overridable.

	A new physical category, net-mgmt, has been created to house
	network management ports.

	The /var/db/port.mkversion file never really took off, and is
	now very obsolete.  Replace the code used to generate and check
	this file with a simple OSVERSION check.  The ports system now
	requires FreeBSD 4.3 or higher.

	The last round of bsd.*.mk changes broke ports that had
	duplicate distinfo entries (e.g. linux_base).  This is now
	fixed.  Along with this fix, only distfiles with a bad checksum
	will be refetched, where as distfiles missing from distinfo will
	not be refetched.

	The PLIST_{DIRS,FILES} macros were passed to the final package
	list unchanged by PLIST_SUB.  This is not always desirable.
	Now, those macros are passed through PLIST_SUB.

	The previous OPTIONS code assumed users would be running port
	build as root.  If this was not the case, OPTIONS configuration
	would fail.  Now, the bits of the config and rmconfig targets
	that require write access to system directories are run under
	SU_CMD.

	The makesum target will now add a SIZE attribute for each
	distfile by default.  This can be overridden by defining NO_SIZE
	in a port's Makefile.  Note: this could probably be expanded to
	omit SIZE attributes for specific distfiles in the future.

20040129:
	SIZE lines in distinfo files:  if you set USE_SIZE when you do "make
	makesum", the byte sizes of the distfiles will be listed in the
	distinfo file. Then, if a distfile is replaced on its master site with
	one of a different size than that listed, "make fetch" will fail with a
	"size mismatch" error before downloading the file and the user will be
	asked to fetch the file by hand. Also, a user will know the size of
	the distfiles before fetching and decide to fetch later.

20040129:
	Start of CHANGES file.
