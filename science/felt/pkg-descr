FElt is a free system for introductory level finite element analysis in the 
mechanical/structural/civil fields. In a command line environment, FElt 
uses an intuitive, straightforward input syntax to describe problems. It 
also includes a graphical user interface for workstations that allows the 
user to set-up, solve and post-process the problem in a single CAD-like 
environment.
