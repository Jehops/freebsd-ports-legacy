The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5
library from Python.  The low-level interface is intended to be a complete
wrapping of the HDF5 1.8 API, while the high-level component supports
Python-style object-oriented access to HDF5 files, datasets and groups.

The goal of this package is not to provide yet another scientific data
model. It is an attempt to create as straightforward a binding as possible
to the existing HDF5 API and abstractions, so that Python programs can
easily deal with HDF5 files and exchange data with other HDF5-aware
applications.
