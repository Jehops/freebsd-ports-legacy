ElmerSolver - the Solution of Partial Differential Equations.

ElmerSolver is thus an independent module that processes the computational
mesh and the model input file containing references to the selected
equations and model parameters. ElmerSolver makes the equations into a
discrete form, handles coupled systems, non-linearities and
time-dependences, and provides output data for visualization.
