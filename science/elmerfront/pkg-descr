ElmerFront - the Graphical User Interface.

ElmerFront is a tool for initializing the computational process in Elmer.
It communicates with external software producing geometrical data, i.e.,
CAD files and computational meshes. ElmerFront generates its own finite
element meshes, allows the user to build mathematical models graphically,
and finally produces input data for ElmerSolver.
