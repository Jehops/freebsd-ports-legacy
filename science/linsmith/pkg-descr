linSmith is a Smith Charting program, mainly designed for educational use.
As such, there is an emphasis on capabilities that improve the 'showing the
effect of'-style of operation.

It's main features are:
   * Definition of multiple load impedances (at different frequencies)
   * Addition of discrete (L, C, parallel and series LC, and transformer) and
     line components (open and closed stubs, line segments)
   * Connection in series and parallel
   * Easy experimentation with values using scrollbars
   * A 'virtual' component switches from impedance to admittance to help
     explaining (or understanding) parallel components
   * The chart works in real impedances (not normalized ones)
   * Direct view of the result on the screen
   * Ability to generate publication quality Postscript output
   * A 'log' file with textual results at each intermediate step
   * Load and circuit configuration is stored separately, permitting several
     solutions without re-defining the other (this may actually change to
     single files - I'm not quite convinced here)
