Objecto Oriented Finite Element Analysis of Real Material Microstructures
__________________

OOF is designed to help materials scientists calculate macroscopic
properties from images of real or simulated microstructures. It is
composed of two cooperating parts: ppm2oof and oof. ppm2oof reads images
in the ppm (Portable Pixel Map) format and assigns material properties to
features in the image. oof conducts virtual experiments on the data
structures created by ppm2oof to determine the macroscopic properties of
the microstructure. Currently, the programs calculate stresses and
strains, but someday we hope to include thermal, electric, and magnetic
field calculations.
