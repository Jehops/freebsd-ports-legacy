To use the G Universe server (guniverse) please create a configuration
with the god binary in /usr/local/etc/gweconfig.xml.

To use the G Universe client (gunverseclient) please run god
for every user that wants to connect to the G Universe. The
configuration should be stored in $HOME/.guniverseclient.xml

The gdemo does not need any configuration.
