Medit is an interactive mesh visualization software, developed by the Gamma
project at INRIA-Rocquencourt.

It is intended to display computation results (in mechanics of the solids or
fluids, thermics, electromagnetism, etc.) on grids 2d (triangles and
quadrangles), 3d (tetrahedrons or hexahedrons) or surfaces (triangles and
quandrangles).
