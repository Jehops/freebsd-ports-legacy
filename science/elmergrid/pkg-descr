ElmerGrid is a utility program for fast creation of structured 2D and
extruded and rotated 3D geometries. ElmerGrid is independent but fully
supports ElmerSolver and ElmerPost. It may be used to create linear,
quadratic and cubic triangles and rectangles. It has also versatile
capabilities in mesh manipulation.

ElmerGrid may also be used in grid manipulation. ElmerGrid may, for
example, be used to transfer different mesh formats to that understood by
ElmerSolver or ElmerPost. ElmerGrid also includes mesh partitioning
routines that have been optimized for ElmerSolver. The partitioning may be
done by METIS or by a simple geometric division.
