Pydap is an implementation of the Opendap/DODS protocol, written from scratch.
You can use Pydap to access scientific data on the internet without having to
download it; instead, you work with special array and iterable objects that
download data on-the-fly as necessary, saving bandwidth and time. The module
also comes with a robust-but-lightweight Opendap server, implemented as a WSGI
application.
