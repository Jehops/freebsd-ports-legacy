DFT++ is a density functional package,
The software is fully cache and register optimized,
and runs in serial, threaded, MPI and mixed threaded-MPI parallel
environments.

For academic users, authors request that publications using results
obtained with this software reference
"New algebraic formulation of density functional calculation,"
by Sohrab Ismail-Beigi and T.A. Arias, Computer Physics Communications
128:1-2, 1-45 (June 2000). and, if using the wavelet basis, further reference
"Multiresolution analysis of electronic structure: semicardinal
and wavelet bases,"
T.A. Arias, Reviews of Modern Physics 71:1, 267-311 (January 1999).
and "Robust ab initio calculation of condensed matter: transparent
convergence through semicardinal multiresolution analysis,'' I.P. Daykov,
T.A. Arias, and Torkel D. Engeness, Physical Review Letters,
90:21, 216402 (May 2003).
