The development of 2.0.0 involved a lot of internal changes and took 
a long time. While the foundation is solid, there has been little user 
testing of this branch. Therefore, you are advised to keep 

	a copy of your XML databases in safe place, 
	
just in case. We believe that this is an extra precaution, but we want 
our users to better be safe than sorry.
