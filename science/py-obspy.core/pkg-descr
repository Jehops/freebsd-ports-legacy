The obspy.core package contains common methods and classes
for ObsPy. It includes UTCDateTime, Stats, Stream and Trace
classes and methods for reading seismograms.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python
framework for processing seismological data. It provides
parsers for common file formats and seismological signal
processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et. al. 2010).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application
development for seismology.
