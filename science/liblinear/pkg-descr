LIBLINEAR is a linear classifier for data with millions of instances and
features. It supports L2-regularized logistic regression (LR), L2-loss
linear SVM, and L1-loss linear SVM.

Main features of LIBLINEAR include 

- Same data format as LIBSVM and similar usage
- One-vs-the rest multi-class classification
- Cross validation for model selection
- Probability estimates (logistic regression only)
- Weights for unbalanced data
