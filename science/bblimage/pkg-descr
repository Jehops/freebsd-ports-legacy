BBLimage is a set of software tools for medical image processing, particularly
skull stripping and segmentation of MR brain images; tools to support other
applications may be added later. These tools are intended to support
researchers who need to prototype new image analysis algorithms or to develop
automated image analysis tools for specific image analysis applications. The
sequence of processing operations is specified through a scripting language
which can be used interactively or in command files; the language used is an
extension of Python.
