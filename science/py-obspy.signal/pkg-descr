The obspy.signal package contains signal processing routines
for seismology. Capabilities include filtering, triggering,
rotation, instrument correction and coordinate transformations.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python
framework for processing seismological data. It provides parsers
for common file formats and seismological signal processing
routines which allow the manipulation of seismological time
series (see Beyreuther et. al. 2010). The goal of the ObsPy
project is to facilitate rapid application development for seismology.
