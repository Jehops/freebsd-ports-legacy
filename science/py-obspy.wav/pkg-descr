The obspy.wav package contains methods in order to read and write
seismogram files in the WAV(audio) format. The data are squeezed to
audible frequencies.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework
for processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common
file formats and seismological signal processing routines which allow
the manipulation of seismological time series (see Beyreuther et. al.
2010). The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application
development for seismology.
