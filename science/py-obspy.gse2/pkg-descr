This module contains Python wrappers for gse_functions - The GSE2 library
of Stefan Stange (http://www.orfeus-eu.org/Software/softwarelib.html#gse).
Currently CM6 compressed GSE2 files are supported, this should be sufficient
for most cases. Gse_functions are written in C and interfaced via Python
ctypes.
