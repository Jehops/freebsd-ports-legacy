Pyvox (formerly known as BBLimage) is a set of software tools for medical
image processing, particularly skull stripping and segmentation of MR brain
images (tools to support other applications may be added later). These tools
are intended to support researchers who need to prototype new image analysis
algorithms or to develop automated image analysis tools for specific image
analysis applications. The sequence of processing operations is specified
through the scripting language Python, which can be used interactively or in
command files.

Pyvox scripts and date files are portable, easily extensible, and suitable
both for rapid prototyping of new algorithms and analysis protocols, and also
for efficient, automated processing of the finished analysis protocols.
