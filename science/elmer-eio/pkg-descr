Input/Output Data base interface for use in the ELMER FEM package.

Elmer is an open-source computational tool for multi-physics problems.

Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics,
electromagnetics and heat transfer. These are described by partial
differential equations which Elmer solves by the Finite Element Method (FEM)
