OASES is a general purpose computer code for modeling seismo-acoustic
propagation in horizontally stratified waveguides using wavenumber
integration in combination with the Direct Global Matrix solution technique.
It is basically an upgraded version of SAFARI. Compared to SAFARI version 3.0
distributed by SACLANTCEN , OASES provides improved numerical efficiency,
and the global matrix mapping has been re-defined to ensure unconditional
numerical stability in the few extreme cases where the original SAFARI has
proved unstable. OASES is downward compatible with SAFARI, and the preparation
of input files follows the guidelines of the SAFARI manual.
However, there are several new options, and OASES is shipped with it's own,
self-contained, documentation.
