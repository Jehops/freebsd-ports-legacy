MayaVi is a scientific data visualizer. It is written in Python and uses the
Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for the visualization. An easy to use GUI using
Tkinter is provided. It is also cross platform and should run on any platform
where both Python and VTK are available (which is almost any *nix, Mac OSX or
Windows).
