MPQC is the Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program. It computes
properties of atoms and molecules from first principles using the time
independent Schrodinger equation. It runs on a wide range of architectures
ranging from individual workstations to symmetric multiprocessors to
massively parallel computers. Its design is object oriented, using  C++.

Capabilities
o Closed shell and general restricted open shell Hartree-Fock energies and
  gradients
o Second order open shell perturbation theory (OPT2[2]) and Z-averaged
  perturbation theory (ZAPT2) energies.
o Second order closed shell Moller-Plesset perturbation theory energies and
  gradients.
o Robust internal coordinate geometry optimizer that efficiently optimizes
  molecules with many degrees of freedom.

You can also validate your mpqc binaries when you employ other settings by:
% make validate >& validate.log &
(it may take few days, though)
