The Orbit Visualization Tool is computer software that makes it possible
to show satellite orbits in the Earth's magnetospheric field. 

The program can display satellite orbits in five coordinate systems (GEI,
GEO, GSM, SMC, GSE), satellite footprints projected on the Earth's surface.
In addition to satellite orbits the software computes and displays various
models of magnetospheric structures, magnetopause, bow shock and electric
potential, geomagnetic activity, and interplanetary field conditions.
