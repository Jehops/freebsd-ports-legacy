LIBSVM is an integrated software for support vector classification, (C-SVC,
nu-SVC ), regression (epsilon-SVR, nu-SVR) and distribution estimation
(one-class SVM ). It supports multi-class classification. The basic algorithm
is a simplification of both SMO by Platt and SVMLight by Joachims. It is also
a simplification of the modification 2 of SMO by Keerthi et al. 

Our goal is to help users from other fields to easily use SVM as a tool.
LIBSVM provides a simple interface where users can easily link it with their
own programs. Main features of LIBSVM include 

Different SVM formulations 
Efficient multi-class classification 
Cross validation for model selection 
Weighted SVM for unbalanced data 
Both C++ and Java sources 
GUI demonstrating SVM classification and regression
