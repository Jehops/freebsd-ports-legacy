ElmerPost - the Visualization of Numerical Results.

The function of ElmerPost is to visualize the numerical results produced
by ElmerSolver and other finite element programs. ElmerPost operates with
the data specific to the unknown variables (temperature, velocity,
pressure, displacement etc.) defined in the mathematical model. ElmerPost
plots e.g. contours and vector fields, and can manipulate computed data
into another form using the built-in MATC-language (for instance heat
fluxes from temperature distributions).
