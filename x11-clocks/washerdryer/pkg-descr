[from README]
washerDryer keeps track of the loads in your washer and
dryer, and alerts you when they are ready.

I'm bad at remembering when to take my clothes out, so I wrote
this program to help me. Hopefully other people will find it
useful as well.

Some features are:

    * Keeps track of up to 10 loads at once
    * Alerts you with system beep, or any command you specify
    * Fully compatible with WindowMaker as a dockapp
    * Command line options (-h for help)            
    * Customize the program through config file, command line
      options, or on the fly
