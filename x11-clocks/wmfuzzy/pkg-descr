wmfuzzy is yet another clock for Windowmaker (so as with ASClock
and however many others). The difference between it and all of those
(that I know of) is that the it only gives you the approximate time
and displays it textually.

Why? because it seemed a fun idea and let's face it when was the
last time you cared it was 22:58 rather than "Five to Eleven?"
