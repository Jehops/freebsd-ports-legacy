From the README:
  Anygui is a generic package which functions as a "front-end" to various
  existing GUI packages for Python, presenting a simple, unified API for
  writing GUI applications.

Python currently lacks a single, standard, cross-platform GUI toolkit.
Anygui aims to solve this problem by providing generic access to several
popular toolkits through one simple API, making it possible to write GUI
applications that work with all these toolkits.

To use this port, you will also need to have at least one of the following
Python GUI toolkits installed:
  - Tkinter	(x11-toolkits/py-tkinter)
  - wxPython	(x11-toolkits/py-wxPython)
  - PyGTK	(x11-toolkits/py-gtk)

(Anygui also supports further toolkits which are not currently relevant to
FreeBSD.)
