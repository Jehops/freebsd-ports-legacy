This is GtkScintilla, a wrapper for the Scintilla (www.scintilla.org) editing
component wich adds some facility to this powerful component written by Neil
Hodgson (and may others).

Scintilla has two little problems:
 - It is available only as a static library
 - It has a strange (for Linux/GTK+ people) API

GtkScintilla addresses both:
 - It is a shared library
 - It is a true GtkWidget subclass with a GTK+ API
