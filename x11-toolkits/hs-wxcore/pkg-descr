wxHaskell is a portable and native GUI library for Haskell.  It is built
on top of wxWidgets, a comprehensive C++ library that is portable across
all major GUI platforms, including GTK, Windows, X11, and MacOS X.  This
version works with wxWidgets 2.8 only.  Distributed under the WXWINDOWS
LIBRARY LICENSE.  Please see LICENSE file, but note that this is
essentially LGPL with an exception allowing binary distribution of
proprietary software.  This is the same license as wxWidgets itself
uses.
