The wxWindows project is a C++ cross-platform GUI toolkit which
was started by Julian Smart.

Currently, work is being done on these ports of wxWindows 2.X: 
        Windows (wxMSW, finished) 
        Unix, GTK+ (wxGTK, finished) 
        Unix, Motif (wxMotif, finished) 
        Macintosh (wxMac, advanced and preview available) 
        OS/2 (wxOS2, just started) 
        BeOS (wxBeOS, just started) 
        SciTech's MGL library (wxMGL, started a few months ago) 

This is the current stable (2.0.1) version of the GTK port.  There
is also a "CVS-Version" that is considered beta.

After installing, look in samples/ of the work directory (assuming
you did not install this as a package --- the package of this port
is broken in that the samples/ are not installed).  The samples
are very helpful.
