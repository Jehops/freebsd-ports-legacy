A GTK Theme Engine. The Xenophilia Theme Engine will after install be loaded
automatically by all GTK+ programs as a module. The module will replace all of
GTK's default rendering functions with its own and also install patches to the
widget code that further alters the look and behaviour of GTK.

The default look can best be described as a mix of NeXTStep, Windows 95, Amiga
and old GTK, but as an engine you are able to redefine as much as without any
engine. The purpose is to make a clean plain look that feels professional,
unlike many extravagant themes for GTK. Note, that "gtkrc-themes" can still be
based on this theme.
