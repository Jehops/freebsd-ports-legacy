erlgtk is a GTK+ binding for Erlang/OTP.

erlgtk allows you to use the popular GTK+ GUI toolkit from the comfort
and safety of the Erlang programming language.

Mutually exclusive support for both GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2.x is included
in this port.  Support for GNOME is present in the binding, but is not
enabled in this port, due to simplicity and stability concerns.  It
may be included in this port at some future date.  Watch this space.
