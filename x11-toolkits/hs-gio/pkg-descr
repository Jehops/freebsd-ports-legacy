GIO is part of the HToolkit. The goal of the HToolkit project is to implement a
portable Haskell library for writing graphical user interfaces (GUI's).

The "Graphics.UI.GIO" library is a 'middle-ground' GUI library for Haskell.  It
is build on the portable GUI library "Port". GIO stands for Graphical IO, and
implements a middle-level, monadic interface for writing GUI's. The library
only uses the IO monad and doesn't implement a design for structure and state.
