This package contains the binary release of BLT version 1.7, an add-on
library for programs using Tk 3.6.  It includes widgets to implement
drag and drop, barcharts and X-Y plots, and including generic Tk
widgets inside a text object.

NOTE: This kit requires as a pre-requisite the Tcl and Tk binary kits.
This version uses FreeBSD shared libraries.
