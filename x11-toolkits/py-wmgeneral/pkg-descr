Pywmgeneral is a python module that will help you develope WindowMaker
dockapps in python. It is mostly a wrapper around the functions from the
popular wmgeneral.c, but some new functions are added too.

It also contains the Python written module pywmhelpers.py which contains
functions to aid the development of wm dockapps. This module contains python
functions that wrap up the functions which the extension module provides. They
ease up argument passing and give nicer return values. Some additional
functions, like help for handling a simple configuration file is also
available. This module is better documented than the pywmgeneral. It is
adviced to only use pywmhelpers and not touch the pywmgeneral module directly
at all. For information about how to use the module, see the documentation in
pywmhelpers.py. It is also possible to import it in the interactive interpreter
and issue 'help(pywmhelpers)'.
