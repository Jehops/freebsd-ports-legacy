From the home page:
 wxPython is a Python extension module that encapsulates the wxWindows
 GUI classes. Currently it is only available for the Win32 and GTK
 ports of wxWindows, but as soon as the other ports are brought up to
 the same level as Win32 and GTK, it should be fairly trivial to enable
 wxPython to be used with the new GUI.
