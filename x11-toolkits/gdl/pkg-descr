Gnome Devtool Libraries
=======================

This package contains components and libraries that are intended to be
shared between GNOME development tools, including gnome-debug,
gnome-build, and gIDE.

The current pieces of GDL include:

 - A code-editing bonboo component based on the Scintilla
   widget (scintilla-control).

 - An utility library that also contains the stubs and skels for
   the above components (gdl).
