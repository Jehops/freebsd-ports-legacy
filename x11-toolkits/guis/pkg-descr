Guis is a small widget server. It is a gtk2 based program listening on a pipe
for widget requests (requests are Python [or Ruby] scripts) and outputting
events or replies Guis is useful for programs (in particular, setuid programs
or (ruby,ocaml,perl...) scripts) which do not want to link in a full widget
toolkit but prefer to delegate the user interface to another process.
