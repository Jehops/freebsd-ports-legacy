Gtk2Hs is a GTK2 binding for Haskell. It is a rewrite of gtk+hs with a couple
of improvements:

  * Automatic memory management.
  * Nearly complete coverage of widget functions and their signals, including
    the new text and list widgets.
  * The convenience wrapper MoGuL (Monad Gui Library) makes it possible to
    create and lookup named widgets in a type safe way.
  * Unicode support.
