Port is part of the HToolkit. The goal of the HToolkit project is to implement
a portable Haskell library for writing graphical user interfaces (GUI's).

To tackle the problem of portability, the library will be built upon a
low-level interface that will be implemented for each different target
platform. The low-level library is called Port and is currently implemented for
GTK and Windows.
