The JDesktop Integration Components (JDIC) project aims to make Java(TM)
technology-based applications ("Java applications") first-class citizens of
current desktop platforms without sacrificing platform independence.

JDIC provides Java applications with access to facilities provided by the native
desktop such as the mailer, the browser, and registered document viewing
applications. Additionally it provides the mechanisms by which Java applications
can integrate into the native desktop such as registering Java applications as
document viewers on the desktop, creating tray icons on the desktop and creating
installer packages.

JDIC consists of a collection of Java packages (JDIC API), all with the package
name prefix org.jdesktop.jdic, and a JNLP application packaging tool (JDIC
Packager).

Note: only the tray icon API is built at the moment.
