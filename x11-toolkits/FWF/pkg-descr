This is the Free Widget Foundation widget release, a collection of no-cost,
freely redistributable X graphical user interface widgets.

The Free Widget Foundation is a grass-roots, all-volunteer effort.

The Free Widget Foundation project was started summer 1990 in order to collect
existing widgets in a well-publicized location to prevent duplication of
effort.  Numerous people have expressed interest in submitting widgets to the
collection.  The collection process is going slowly because of lack of time
and organizational needs.  The "Free Widget Foundation" is a pun on the "Free
Software Foundation" title.  While the two organizations share some similar
goals, that is the improvement of the quality and quantity of
freely-redistributable public software, this organization is in no way related
to the Free Software Foundation or the GNU projects.  In fact, we aren't even
a "foundation" in the legal meaning of the word.
