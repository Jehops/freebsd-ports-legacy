THE FREE WIDGET FOUNDATION

The Free Widget Foundation (FWF) was first organized in the summer of 1990, as
a grass-roots, all-volunteer effort to generate a publically accessible
repository for X widgets.  The goal of the FWF was to gather a set of
powerful, flexible, freely-accessible widgets, assisting programmers to
construct complicated user-interfaces.  Furthermore, we wanted to discourage
multiple parties from "reinventing the widget" multiple times, and encourage
the development of a single, quality object.
