GtkEditor is a source code editor widget for GTK+. It is currently used, in one
version or another, in several GTK+/GNOME applications, including gIDE,
VDKBuilder, GXEdit, and Bluefish. 

The longterm goal of GtkEditor is to provide a framework for source code
editing in GTK+ applications, whether just for editing macros or for full
fledged IDEs. We try to achieve this through a highly configurable editor
widget sub-classing the gtktext widget. After initialisation, the editor widget
can be treated as the usual text widget, and all source-code editing features
are taken care of by the widget itself. The behaviour of the editor is decided
by dynamic libraries loaded during initialisation of the widget or statically
linked with the application using the widget. These libraries can be hand-coded
or created using tools supplied with GtkEditor. 

In the current version of GtkEditor, the widget only support syntax
highlighting, but future versions will include automatic/semi-automatic
indenting, parenthesis matching, and what other nifty features we can come up
with.
