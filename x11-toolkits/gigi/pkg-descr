GiGi (aka GG) is a GUI library for OpenGL. It is platform-independent (it runs
at least on Linux and Windows, and probably more), compiler-independent (it
compiles under at GCC 3.2 or higher and MSVC++ 7.1 or higher, and probably
more), and driver-independent. A reference driver for SDL is provided, and it
is straightforward to write one for yourself should you decide to do so.

Features:
* True modularity. You provide the initialized OpenGL environment and user
  input, and GG provides the GUI behavior. A reference SDL input driver is
  provided.
* Independence of platform, compiler, and input driver/application framework.
* Applicability to multiple types of frame-based apps. Any frame-based app can
  use GG, from FPS to TBS games.
