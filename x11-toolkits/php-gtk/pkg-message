The port has now been installed. Be sure to adjust the config-file
in e.g. /usr/local/etc/php.gtk/php.ini.
I have created a sample configuration file named php.ini-dist which
should be a rough guide.

For convenience put something like
"alias gtkphp='php -q -c /usr/local/etc/php.gtk/'"
in your .profile.
