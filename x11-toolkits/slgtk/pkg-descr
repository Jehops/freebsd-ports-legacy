The SLgtk package binds the GIMP Toolkit, also known as Gtk,
to the S-Lang scripting language. It provides an importable module
which makes most of Gtk and its constituent libraries callable directly
from S-Lang scripts.

With SLgtk the S-Lang programmer now has access to a powerful,
cross-platform widget set for creating sophisticated
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The package also includes bindings
to GtkExtra, which are used in the vwhere visualization and filtering guilet,
as well as a gdk-pixbuf loader for the FITS image file format
widely used within astronomy, and an easy-to-use but powerful
image compositing, display, and output tool.
