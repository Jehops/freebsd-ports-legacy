This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk4.0p3 (John Ousterhout's production
release).  This version (Tk400.200) requires perl5.002 or later.

This version is the first 'production' release. There is little change from
beta release Tk-b11.02 and even less from Tk-b12.  See Changes for what is
different.

Although this is a production release it should be noted that some
sub-modules are not as "finished" as others. The interfaces to Tcl/Tk's
"core" widgets Text, Entry, Canvas, Button, RadioButton, Checkbutton, Scale,
Scrollbar, Listbox, Menu, Menubutton are stable
.
As are core Bitmap, Photo and Pixmap image types. The "Composite" or "Mega
Widget" interface is also stable but lacking in some features.

The less finished parts include:
   - Tk::HTML needs libwww package from CPAN which in turn requires the 
     libnet package. It will eventually be improved as libwww improves.
   - Tk::IO requires the 'IO::' package which was first introduced into
     perl distribution in 5.003_01. It is available in CPAN archive for 
     earlier releases. Tk::IO is likely to change as perl's IO evolves, and
     with tk4.1  changes.
   - Tk::Ghostview postscript previewer is still experimental, I use a
     "Display Postscript" extension which I may release at some point.
   - Tk::Pod should be changed to use new Pod:: module(s) from CPAN.
   - Tk::DragDrop works on Solaris (and SunOS to some extent)
     it should really be based on a standard.
   - Tk::Xlib will evolve further if tk4.1's Win32/Mac ports permit.
   - Most of the Tix stuff only has C code ported, the many of the tcl parts
     still needing converting to perl.
       - HList works reasonably well
       - There is a port of NoteBook in Contrib - I want to clean up
       - InputO has not been tested. 
   - There is an intent to add an object oriented interface to Canvas items,
     (existing interface will still work).
   - There are partially completed things like NNTP News reader which 
     may be finished one day.
   - There are point-demo and test scripts in distribution
