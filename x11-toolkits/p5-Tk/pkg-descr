This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.0p2 (John Ousterhout's production
release).            

It also includes all the C code parts of Ioi Kim Lam's Tix4.1.0.006 release.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version also contains re-worked Image code based on tcl/tk Img extension 
by Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@worldaccess.nl>

This version (Tk800.008) requires perl5.004_02 or later.
Some of Tk::IO and 'fileevent' do not work without 
Graham Barr's TIEHANDLE patches e.g. perl5.004_62
