  Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

  This archive contains modules that allow you to use gtk in Python
  programs.  At present, it is a fairly complete set of bindings.
  Despite the low version number, this piece of software is quite
  useful, and is usable to write moderately complex programs.
