Gtkmodule and Gtkinter
======================
Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

This archive contains modules that allow you to use gtk in Python
programs.  At this point, it is still very much a work in progress.
Despite the low version number, this peice of software is quite useful,
and is usable to write moderately complex programs.  (see the examples
directory for some examples of the simpler programs you could write).

If you have any enhancements or bug reports, please send them to me at
james@daa.com.au.  If you are going to send me diffs, my prefered
format is unified diff (ie. diff -u), although context diffs are OK as
well.  Please don't send me diffs which don't have any context, as these
are almost useless if I try to apply them manually, or have a different
version of the source tree.
