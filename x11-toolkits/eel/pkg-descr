The eel library contains a number of generally useful classes and functions.
Many of them are extensions to things in glib, gtk, gnome-libs, and other
widely-used GNOME platform libraries. The long term plan is to move much of
this into the platform libraries themselves.

Almost all of the eel library was previously part of Nautilus, in the
"libnautilus-extensions" private library in Nautilus 1.0 - 1.0.2. It is now
a separate package so it can be used by packages other than Nautilus.
