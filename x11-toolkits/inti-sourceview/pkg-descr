Inti-SourceView is an Inti binding for GtkSourceView, the new GTK+ source
code editing widget.

GtkSourceView is a text widget that extends the standard GTK+ 2.x text widget
GtkTextView. It improves GtkTextView by implementing features typical of a
source code editor such as syntax highlighting, bracket matching, markers and
adds support for undo/redo operations.
