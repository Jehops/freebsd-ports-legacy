PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt  C++ class library which
extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
applications. It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and
various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
point values.

PyQwt addresses the problem of integrating PyQt, Qt, Qwt, NumPy and
optionally SciPy. Look at the Command Line Interface (CLI) examples and
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) examples to get an idea of what you
can do with PyQwt.
