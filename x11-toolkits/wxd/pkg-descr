wxWidgets is a C++ cross-platform GUI toolkit.
Link with the appropriate library for your platform and 
compiler, and your application will adopt the look and 
feel appropriate to that platform.

D is a general purpose systems and applications programming
language. It is a higher level language than C++, but retains the
ability to write high performance code and interface directly
with the operating system API's and with hardware. D is not a
scripting language, nor an interpreted language.

wxD is wxWidgets bindings for the D programming language.
