GtkDatabox is designed to display large amounts of numerical data fast and
easy. Thousands of data points (X and Y coordinate) may be displayed without
any problems, zooming and scrolling as well as optional rulers are already
included. 

The widget may be used as display for oscilloscopes or other applications that
need to display fast changes in their data. 

At the present time only dotted curves, bars or lines may be used, but other
forms of representation like different dots or pixmaps are planned for the
near future.

In addition user defined drawing functions will be added, along with structs
for exporting the display to other media (i.e. PS, PNG, etc.)
