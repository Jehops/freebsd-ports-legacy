GAI, The General Applet Interface library is a library that will help applet
programmers a lot. The goal of this library is to give programmers a simple yet
powerful applet interface. This library supports both Dockapps and Gnome 2
Panel Applets. The applet program doesn't have to care about if the applet
will be used on the Gnome panel or in the dock. The library handles that.
Over 50% of the code in a Dockapp and a Gnome 2 Panel applet does actually
only one thing, setting up the applet window. With GAI, this can be reduced
to just a few lines of code.
