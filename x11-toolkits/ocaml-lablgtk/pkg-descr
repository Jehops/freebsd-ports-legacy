LablGTK uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a
strongly typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to
gtk+. This is not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach
taken by gtk+.

It is still under development, but already fully functional. All
widgets (but one) are available, with almost all their methods. The
GLArea widget is also supported in combination with LablGL. Lots of
examples are provided.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel,
which allows for interactive use of the library.

Please see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ocaml/lablgtk/README for further
information.
