Inti is a set of integrated C++ foundation classes for developing GTK+
applications on UNIX-like systems.

Inti combines the power of GTK+ and the power of C++ into a state-of-the-art
GUI toolkit that makes developing applications easy, intuitive and efficient.
There are more than 330 classes that wrap most of the objects found in the
ATK, GDK, GDK-PIXBUF, GLib, GTK and Pango libraries. It has its own system
of signals and slots which make using native GTK signals or creating your own
signals easy. There is a standard string compatible UTF-8 string class, a full
set of simple example programs, a GNU Autotools test project, a C++ version of
the GTK+ demonstration program, extensive reference documentation and a
tutorial.
