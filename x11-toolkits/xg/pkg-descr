In the many years that I have been developing GUIs for UNIX, I have
always envied the controls that are commonly available for MS Windows
applications. In attempt to rectify this situation I designed the 
"Xg Widget Set". This widget set is an extension of the Motif widget
set and provides many of the controls found in MS Windows applications.

The widget set is self contained, as such it requires no additional
libraries other than X, Xt, and Motif (1.1, 1.2.x or 2.0).
