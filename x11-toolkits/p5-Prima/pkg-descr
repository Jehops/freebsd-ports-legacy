Prima is an extensible Perl toolkit for multi-platform GUI development.
Platforms supported include Linux, Windows NT/9x/2K, OS/2 and UNIX/X11
workstations (FreeBSD, IRIX, SunOS, Solaris and others).

The toolkit contains a rich set of standard widgets and has emphasis on
2D image processing tasks.  A Perl program using PRIMA looks and behaves
identically on X, Win32 and OS/2 PM.

The toolkit includes a visual builder.
