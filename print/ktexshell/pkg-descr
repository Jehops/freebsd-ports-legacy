KTeXShell is a KDE frontend to the popular TeX/LaTeX-
typesetting system. The indended audience is the difference
between all (explicit and implicit) TeX-users and the users
of tools like LyX or KLyX. That means: KTeXShell does
only provide a frontend to TeX and the related programs,
while the user has to keep on coding his documents in the
TeX language. In other words: This is for TeX hackers.

Some Features:
--------------

- TeX, Editor, Viewer... are called from menu or toolbar
- new primary files can be generated from templates
- TeX formats, editors and viewers can be configured as well
  as template- and working directory
- in case of TeX errors, an error handling dialog helps you
  to proceed
- Integrated tools: at present we have makeindex and a generic
  dvips-call (for printing)
