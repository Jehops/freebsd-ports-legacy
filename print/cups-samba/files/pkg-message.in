To complete the installation of print/cups-samba follow cupsaddsmb(8)
manual page as below:

1. Follow section "SAMBA CONFIGURATION" with following remarks:

   Adjust path for [print$].
   
   There is no standard directory so you should create one, you may pick
   any directory but it must NOT be %%PREFIX%%/share/cups/drivers as
   suggested in the past nor anything under %%PREFIX%%/etc/samba which
   is not world readable.
   It must be writeable by printer admin[2] (i.e. root) and world readable.
   
   Recommended
   # mkdir -p  /var/lib/samba/drivers
   # chmod 755 /var/lib/samba/drivers
   
2. Follow section "MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS"

   You may skip 64-bit drivers if you don't need them.
   
3. Follow section "CUPS POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS"

   Nothing needs to be done here as you should already have all files.
   NOTE: 64-bit CUPS drivers were not yet released[1].
   If you have 64-bit Windows machines, for now you have to fetch CUPS
   drivers from SVN:
   
   # svn export http://svn.easysw.com/public/windows/trunk/x64 %%PREFIX%%/share/cups/drivers/x64

4. Run cupsaddsmb

   To export all printers to MS Windows NT clients:
   # cupsaddsmb -v -a
   
   You will be prompted for the password of samba user named root.
   If you have not set it already do it before running cupsaddsmb:
   # smbpasswd -a

5. On your Windows machine, browse for a network printer as usual.
   Opening it should automagically install drivers.


For more uses please refer to cupsaddsmb(8).
