CUPS-SAMBA provides a means to export CUPS printers from a FreeBSD
server to Windows NT/XP/2000/2003 clients with a single Windows
driver that customizes the printer based on the PPD file for the
printer.

You will also need the Microsoft Windows PostScript drivers from
a Windows 2000 or higher system. Consult the cupsaddsmb(8) man page
for details.
