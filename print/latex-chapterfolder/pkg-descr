This package simplifies working with folder structures that match the
chapter/section/subsection structure. It provides macros to define a
folder that contains the file for a chapter/section/subsection, and
provides macros that allow inclusion without using the full path,
rather the path relative to the current folder of the
chapter/section/subsection. It makes easy changing the name of a
folder, for example.
