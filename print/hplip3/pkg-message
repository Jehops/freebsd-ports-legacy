**********************************************************
Add the following to your rc.conf:

hpiod_enable="YES"
hpssd_enable="YES"

The default setup runs hpiod as the hplip user and adds 
hplip to the operator group.  So all you have to do if you
have a custom ruleset setup is add the following to that
ruleset in devfs.rules:

add path 'ugen*' group operator
add path 'ugen*' mode 0660
