The goal of the Virtual Paper project is to make on-line reading
an attractive alternative to reading printed documents (such as
books, manuals, or reports).  We're talking about actual reading
here, not just browsing or finding documents (though we have support
for that too, as you'll see).  And we're talking about documents
that can be as large as full-length books, not just short reports,
and not brief articles such as most electronic mail or WWW pages.
