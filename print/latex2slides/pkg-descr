latex2slides is a simple graphical program that produces a set of HTML/JPEG
slides from a LaTeX (or TeX) source FILE. The program first produces a
multipage postscript, using latex (or tex ) and dvips. Each postscript page
is converted to a JPEG image using ImageMagick's convert. The program then
makes one HTML page for each JPEG (or slide), and an index.html page. As a
result, each slide in your slide presentation corresponds to one of the
postscript pages you would obtain running latex on the LaTeX source.
Alternatively, the source can be a multipage postscript, DVI or PDF FILE,and
the image format for the slides can be set to PNG.
