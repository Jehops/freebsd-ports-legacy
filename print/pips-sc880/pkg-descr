is called Photo Image Print System for Linux and there exist the
filters for other EPSON bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. It
supports English, French, Germany, Spanish, Italian and Portugue. See

And then this port has a modified filter "filter-sc880.rev" which is
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it, you add the
next entries into /etc/printcap.
