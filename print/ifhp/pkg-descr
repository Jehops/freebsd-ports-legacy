The IFHP print filter is a highly configurable and almost universal
print filter for the LPRng print spooler.  It can handle text, PostScript,
PCL, and PJL compatible printers, as well as doing synchronization, resetting,
getting page counts,  end of job detection and other administrative functions.
It will handle HP, Tektronics,  Xerox, Qume, and just about any printer that
can accept a connection.  Configuration is done using the /etc/ifhp.conf file
which can be tailored for your particular printer.
