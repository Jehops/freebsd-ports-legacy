Apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that allows you to print different document
types "automagically" without having to convert them manually into something
which is understood by your lineprinter. Apsfilter development started in 1993,
so apsfilter is now a mature and powerful printing solution for any flavour of
Unix running lpd or LPRng as line printer scheduler.

Apsfilter supports lots of file and compression types. Its even possible to
print compressed documents. Apsfilter supports printing on local as well as
on Appletalk-, Unix- and Windows remote printers.

General and "per printer-queue" based config files allow you to configure
the printer for your needs. Additionally lpr commandline options, -C for
lpd and -Z for LPRng, allow you to change printing parameters like print
quality, orientation, duplex mode, etc... "on the fly" without having to
reconfigure any config file.

A SETUP script helps you to test various supported ghostscript drivers prior
installation. SETUP finally makes the necessary entries in /etc/printcap,
creates spool directories and apsfilter default config files as needed.
