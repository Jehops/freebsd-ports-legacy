Have fun using apsfilter by typing:
    lpr ascii.Z test.gif picture.tiff TeX.dvi.gz webpage.html docu.pdf
That's what apsfilter is designed for ;-)

apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that saves you the work to a) look for
and b) use filter programs, that convert your file into something suitable
for your printer. Apsfilter first translates every document into Postscript
and then pipes it through ghostscript, if you don't have a PS printer.

Printer Setup is done with the SETUP program. It saves your current
printcap entries and creates printcap entries for one or more of
your local printers. 

New features: 
	- supports different printer resolutions (if manually configured), i.e.
		lpr -P{low,med,high} test.ps
	- supports LPRng as printer scheduler
	- supports ghostscript5.x uniprint driver
	- writes the first 8k of a print job to /tmp for file type
	  recognition, so file(1) doesn't need to be able to read from
	  a pipe (stdin) and rewindstadin isn't needed anymore for dvips.
Send me a postcard if you like it ! Have fun !
