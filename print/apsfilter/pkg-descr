Apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that allows you to print different document
types "automagically" without having to convert them manually into something
which is understood by your lineprinter. Apsfilter development started in 1993,
so apsfilter is now a mature and powerful printing solution for any flavour of
Unix running lpd or LPRng as line printer scheduler. It supports the latest
ghostscript version and 3rd party printer driver like hpijs, ijs, hpdj, pcl3
and gimp-print, to mention some.
Apsfilter autodetects lots of file(34), archive(11) and compression(6) types.
Its even possible to print compressed documents. Apsfilter supports printing
on local and on Appletalk-, Novell (NEW !), Unix- and Windows remote printers.
General and "per printer-queue" based config files allow you to configure
the printer for your needs. Additionally lpr commandline options, -C for
lpd and -Z for LPRng, allow you to change printing parameters like print
quality, orientation, duplex mode, etc. "on the fly" without having to
reconfigure any config file.
A SETUP script helps you to test various supported ghostscript drivers prior
installation. SETUP finally makes the necessary entries in /etc/printcap,
creates spool directories and apsfilter default config files as needed.
A handbook in HTML is available. Support ONLY via mailinglists, see homepage !
New tools: "aps2file" allows you to print to a file via apsfilter,
"apspreview" previews files as generated by apsfilter using gv and friends,
"apsfilter-bug" assists you in doing bug- and problem reports.
