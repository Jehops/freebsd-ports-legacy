apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that allows you to print different document
types "automagically" without having to convert them manually into something
which is understood by your lineprinter. Apsfilter supports the following
file and compression types: gzip, bzip, compress, freeze, pack, ASCII, BMP,
Data (data,PCL,...), English, TeX DVI, FIG, GIF, Group 3 Fax, HTML, JPEG,
Mail/News, PBM/PNM/PPM, PC Bitmap Data, PDF, Postscript(tm), raw, script
(shell,..), Text, sunraster, tiff, roff (nroff, groff, troff).

Example: lpr ascii.Z test.gif picture.tiff TeX.dvi.gz webpage.html docu.pdf

Prerequisites: Filter programs, installed automatically by FreeBSD ports
collection, Postscript Printer or Printer supported by ghostscript, Berkeley
compatible line printer scheduler (lpd) or Line Printer Next Generation
(LPRng) which is so to say the successor.

SETUP installs you printer by creating suitable /etc/printcap entries for
serial and parallel printers and customizes apsfilter for your system/printer.
