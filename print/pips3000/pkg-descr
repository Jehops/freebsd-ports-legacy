called Photo Image Print System for Linux and there exist the filters
for other EPSON bubble jet printers. By using this driver you can

This port has a modified filter "filter3000.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips3000/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips3000          env LANG=fr pips3000	  
  env LANG=de pips3000             env LANG=es pips3000	  
  env LANG=it pips3000             env LANG=nl pips3000
  env LANG=pt pips3000             env LANG=ko pips3000 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips3000 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips3000 (**)

(*) These do not work well.
