The X Printing Panel (XPP) is a completely free (GPL) tool for easy choosing of
the desired printer out of a list of all available printers and for setting
printer options by an easy-to-use graphical user interface. One simply calls the
program (xpp) instead of the usual utilities (lpr or lp) at the command line or
out of applications.
