Before running kaspaliste, you have to create a postgresql database.
Please refer to to the postgresql documentation.

Once postgresql has been initialized, create your kaspaliste database:

%createdb kaspaliste

Then create your tables:

%psql kaspaliste -f create.tables.sql

This script has been installed in %%DATADIR%%.
