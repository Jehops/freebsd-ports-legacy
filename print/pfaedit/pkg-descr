PfaEdit is a PostScript font editor which can create and modify outline
fonts in Type 1, CID-Keyed Fonts, TrueType, or OpenType format. It can
generate bitmaps and save in BDF format or embedded bitmaps in TrueType/
OpenType fonts. 

If you have installed AutoTrace Version 0.28 or newer (older versions
are incompatible to this version of PfaEdit), you can generate outlines
from imported bitmap images.
