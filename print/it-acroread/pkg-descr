This program displays and prints Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.  It also allows you to search for text in a PDF file, or in
all the PDF files in a directory.

This is the Italian version.  It also has support for the English
language.  To configure the language, navigate to
Edit->Preferences->International->Application Language, set it to
"Choose at application startup" and restart the program.

After installation, use the "acroread7-it" command to run it.
