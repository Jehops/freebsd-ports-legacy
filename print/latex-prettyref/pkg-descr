Prettyref provides a command \newrefformat, which specifies the way in
which a reference is typeset, according to a label "identification".
The identification is set in the \label command, by using prefixed label
names; so instead of \label{mysection}, one uses \label{sec:mysection},
and prettyref interprets the "sec:" part.  The package is compatible
with hyperref and with other packages.
