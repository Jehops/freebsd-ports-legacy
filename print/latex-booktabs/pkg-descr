booktabs is to enable the easy production of tables such as should
appear in published scientific books and journals.  What distinguishes
these from plain LaTeX tables is the default use of additional space
above and below rules, and rules of varying `thickness'.  What further
distinguishes them from the tables many people do produce using LaTeX
is the absence of vertical rules and double rules.
