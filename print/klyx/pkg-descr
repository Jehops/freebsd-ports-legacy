KLyX is a modern approach of writing documents with a computer which breaks
with the tradition of the obsolete typewriter concept. It is designed for
people who want a professional output with a minimum of time effort, without
becoming specialists in typesetting. Compared to common word processors KLyX
will increase the productivity a lot, since most of the type- setting will be
done by the computer, not the author. With KLyX the author can concentrate on
the contents of his writing, since the computer will take care of the look.
    
KLyX uses the professional typesetting system LaTeX as backend. This means
that it is very suitable for scientific work and guarantees first class
output in a quality only known from books. In fact KLyX includes the best
available formula editor used by thousands of mathematicians all over the
world. The formula editor is seamlessly integrated and allows editing of
equations inside the document. KLyX is also highly optimized and much faster
than usual wordprocessors. It is also able to handle documents with several
hundred pages, lots of pictures, tables and formulas included without
becoming slow or instable. But of course you can also use this incredible and
powerful tool for something trivial like writing a simple letter ;-)
