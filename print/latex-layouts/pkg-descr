The layouts package enables the display of various elements of a
document's layout including: the general page layout; disposition
of floats; layout of paragraphs, lists, footnotes, table of contents, 
and sectional headings; font boxes.

Facilities are provided for a document designer to experiment with
the layout parameters.
