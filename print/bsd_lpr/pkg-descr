This is a port of the BSD lpr sources.

Like the compat ports, this allows lpr to be installed as a package,
at a later date, even if the options were not built with the base
FreeBSD system, i.e. when world was built and installed with WITHOUT_LPR
defined in /etc/make.conf.

It may also be of use to folk who are managing embedded systems.
Currently it is used as a testbed for the OpenPrinting API with pfSense,
to build a very tight embedded printing appliance.
