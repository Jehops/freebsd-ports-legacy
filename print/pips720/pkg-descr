This port has a modified filter "filter720.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips720/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips720          env LANG=fr pips720	  
  env LANG=de pips720             env LANG=es pips720

  env LANG=pt pips720             env LANG=ko pips720 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips720 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips720 (**)
