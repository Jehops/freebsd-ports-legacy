This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F850 (supported BCI-5
inks). The filter is called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux
and there exist the filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By
using this driver you can print out as high quality as you use the
Windows driver. See the below URLs:
