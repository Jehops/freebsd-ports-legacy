This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F850. The filter is
called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux and there exist the
filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the
below URLs:

And then this port has filters filter850 and filter850_gui which are
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it and connect it
via "ulpt", you add the next entry into /etc/printcap.

bjfilter850|Canon BJ F850:\
        :lp=/dev/ulpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter850/filter850:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter850:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs
bjfilter850_gui|Canon BJ F850 with GUI:\
        :lp=/dev/ulpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter850/filter850_gui:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter850_gui:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs

Notice: If you use filter850_gui then the host which you are using
have to be the printer saver. Then before using it, you have to run X
and execute "xhost localhost".
