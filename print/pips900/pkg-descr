This port has a modified filter "filter900.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips900/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips900          env LANG=fr pips900	  
  env LANG=de pips900             env LANG=es pips900	  
  env LANG=it pips900             env LANG=nl pips900
  env LANG=pt pips900             env LANG=ko pips900 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips900 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips900 (**)
