epsmerge is a perl program for merging EPS (Encapsulated Postscript)
files into one bigger EPS file. It does this by reading the files
and arranging them in rows (or columns), squeezing them together
so that they all fit. It can squeeze in several ways: uniformly,
preserving aspect ratios, preserving the relative sizes of the
images, etc. It can also be used to format a single EPS file on a
paper which can then be sent to a printer. There are options to put
labels over or under the images.
