Send print jobs to lpd servers anywhere on a network. Does not require
lpd server to be listed in client's /etc/printcap, and is therefore
useful for printing from machines one does not have root access on.

This version has been completely redesigned and rewritten from the
ground up. the source code is oh-so-much-better than before. there are
also a number of user-visible changes:

        . addition of new rlprm command 
        . new hooks for internationalization support 
        . build procedure now uses automake in addition to autoconf 
        . new --timeout option in case remote end dies 
        . new --send-data-first option to improve support for buggy lpd's 
        . now works with hp jetdirect printers 
	. shiny-new rlpr progress meter, useful for printing over slow links
        . all printing commands default to `lp' printer now, like bsd 

Gettext  (-lintl) is  ripped  out by  this port  because  it adds  bloat
without functionality -- there are  no language files supplied with this
package yet. May be in future versions.
