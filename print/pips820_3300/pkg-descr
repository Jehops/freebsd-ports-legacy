This port has a modified filter "filter820_3300.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips820_3300/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
