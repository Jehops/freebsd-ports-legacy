GuitarTeX converts the Chord format into "normal" LaTeX format like a kind
of preprocessor. This may be a single song or even a complete songbook. You
may as well translate your chord file directly into postscript or PDF format.

If you know LaTeX, you may edit the output file. The advantage of GuitarTeX
is that you can use all LaTeX features to design a single song sheet or
songbook, e.g.: packages like graphics or MusicTeX, table of contents,
marginpar's, and so on.
