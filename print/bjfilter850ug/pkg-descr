This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F850ug. The filter is
called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux and there exist the
filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the
below URLs:

And then this port has filters filter850ug and filter850ug_gui which are
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it and connect it
via "ulpt", you add the next entry into /etc/printcap.

the host which you are using.
