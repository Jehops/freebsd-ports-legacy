	To the best of my knowledge, every fontfile in this package
	is either freeware or shareware.  Most are free and unencumbered;
	the best of the hundreds that I've found.

	If you know that a font in this list is stolen or for any
	other reason should  not be included in this distribution,
	please write me, Gary Kline,

			kline@thought.org

	with supporting documentation.  Inappropriate fonts will be
	stricken in the next Xenscript distribution.

	In the README file in the ${DESTDIR} which defaults to 
	/usr/local/share/enscript/xenscript  is a list of the font
	names for the 120+ fonts in v 0.75.  Also in this directory
	are many *.readme files from the shareware distributions.
