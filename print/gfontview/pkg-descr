An outline font viewer.

I want to be able to view uninstalled fonts. So I started with the program,
left alone all installation issues (handled by DTM), and tried to optimize
it as a font displayer. It should handle Type 1 and True Type fonts and have
some enhancements such as finding typographically similar fonts.
