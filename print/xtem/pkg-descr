       xtem - TeX menu for the X Window System

       xtem  is  an  X11  program  that  makes it easy to use TeX
       (incl. editing, previewing, printer  selection,	printing,
       spell checking etc.)  with a minimum of unix knowledge and
       no knowledge of the specific installation.

       Syntax help to  the  LaTeX  commands  (including  complete
       examples) are presented during editing.

       xtem  runs on workstations (and X-terminals) running the X
       Window System and Tcl/Tk/TclX.

       The user may easily select and save his preferences  (such
       as editor, previewer etc.).

       (...)"

       Buttons,  help texts, etc.  can be set to the  user's pre-
       ferred  language.  At the  moment the  following languages
       are already available:  English and German  (Others can be
       added "easily" by editing the helpfiles accordingly).
