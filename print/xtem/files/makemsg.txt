	Obviously,  xtem  (as an X11  frontend)  for TeX is  quite useless
	without TeX. By default, though, there's no check in this port for
	it in order to avoid space problems during build. You can activate
	it by typing  "make BUILD_IT_ALL=yes ..."  instead of  just  "make
	...".  In that case,  the existence of tex will be checked for and
	"teTeX-0.4" will be installed when it can't be found. In addition,
	"gv"  (a "nicer" version  of ghostview)  will  be checked  for and
	installed as well, if not found.

	Happy TeXing,           Peter Cornelius <pc@akk.uni-karlsruhe.de>
