apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that saves you work to "look for" and
"use different filter programs", that convert your file into something
suitable for your printer.

Here a "real life" example, how apsfilter makes your life easier
printing different document format, even if compressed:
    lpr ascii.Z test.gif picture.tiff TeX.dvi.gz webpage.html docu.pdf

- Apsfilter first translates every document into Postscript and then pipes
  it through ghostscript, if you don't have a PS printer.
- Printer Setup is done with the SETUP program.

  see who is using apsfilter and where. That would be very kind !

If you are a satisfied apsfilter customer, then send mail to
