Here a "real life" example, how apsfilter makes your life easier
printing different document format, even if compressed:
    lpr ascii.Z test.gif picture.tiff TeX.dvi.gz webpage.html docu.pdf

apsfilter is a magic printfilter, that saves you work to "look for" and
"use different filter programs", that convert your file into something
suitable for your printer. Apsfilter first translates every document
into Postscript and then pipes it through ghostscript, if you don't
have a PS printer. Printer Setup is done with the SETUP program.
It saves your current printcap entries and creates printcap entries
for one or more of your local printers. New features: 
	- various bugfixes and feature enhancements, see ChangeLog file
	- supports different print resolutions (requires manual configuration)
		lpr -P{low,med,high} test.ps
	- supports LPRng as printer scheduler
	- supports ghostscript5.x uniprint driver
	- writes the first 8k of a print job to /tmp for file type
	  recognition, so file(1) doesn't need to be able to read from
	  a pipe (stdin) and rewindstdin isn't needed anymore for dvips.
