The pict2e package extends the existing LaTeX picture environment, using
the familiar technique (cf. the graphics and color packages) of driver
files.  The package documentation (pict2e.dtx) has a fair number of
examples of use, showing where things are improved by comparison with
the LaTeX picture environment.
