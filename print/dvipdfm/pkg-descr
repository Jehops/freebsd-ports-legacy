Dvipdfm is a DVI to PDF translator, developed by Mark A. Wicks.
It tends to produce nicer output than by using, say, dvips 
followed by ps2pdf.

This port is designed to be used with teTeX, which it will load
as a dependency.  teTeX is incompatible with other versions of
tex (such as that from /usr/ports/print/tex) and latex, etc,
and these should be deinstalled first.
