Dvilj2 converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL (i.e. HP Printer
Control Language) commands suitable for printing on a HP LaserJet+, HP
LaserJet II and fully compatible printers.

Dvilj2p converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL commands suitable
for printing on a HP LaserJet IIp, HP LaserJet III or HP Laserjet 2000
and fully compatible printers. This version uses a newer PCL command
set and provides landscape printing.

Dviljp and dvilj are similar to dvilj2p and dvilj2 but they support
only 128 character fonts. They may be used for Laserjet clones which
do not support 256 character fonts.

Dvilj4 is for the HP LasterJet IV printer familiy and fully compatible
clones. It implements a superset of the commands available for dvilj2p
and prints with an resolution of 600 dpi. In addition it provides
support for the printers builtin fonts using Karl Berry's coding
scheme.

Dvi3812 converts TeX-output .dvi files into PMP files, the native
command language of the IBM 3812 page printer.
