=== WARNING ===

Adobe Reader 9 is currently not compatible with the latest version of
Linux emulation on FreeBSD. Specifically, you may see the following
error message:

 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'RSException'

If this happens, please try print/acroread8 instead.  Developments for
improving the compatibility are in progress.  If you have any questions
on this port, contact hrs@FreeBSD.org.

==
To run this, set ADOBE_LANG=%%ADOBE_LANG%% and use %%PREFIX%%/bin/acroread.
(when LANG is set, ADOBE_LANG will be set automatically based on it)
