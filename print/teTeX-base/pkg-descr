teTeX is a complete TeX distribution for UNIX compatible systems.

It features:

  * TeX 3.14159, Metafont 2.718, LaTeX2e Rel. 04 <1995/12/01> PL#1,
    dvipsk 5.58f, xdvik 18f using kpathsea 2.6, and DC Fonts 1.2;
  * file organisation according to upcoming TeX Directory Standard;
  * easy to install with install.sh (not needed for this port!);
  * easy to customize with `texconfig' utility;
  * lots of extra LaTeX packages (most of them mentioned in the
    LaTeX Companion);
  * much documentation: more than 100 dvi-files plus teTeX manual, 
    teTeX FAQ and TeX FAQ;
  * support for read-only inputs tree (it is thus possible to use 
    an alternate destination for newly created fonts);
  * ready for multi platform setup;
  * fast file searching: web2c was patched to work with kpathsea-2.6
    so that the search paths are chosen to give high performance;
  * run-time configuration files for DVI drivers as well as TeX &
    friends;
  * a nice set of fonts to play with: PostScript fonts, ams, pandora, 
    cm, dc, oldgerman -- all easily accessable by LaTeX;
  * the whole distribution can be installed anywhere in the filesystem
    (e.g., /usr/TeX or /usr/local/tex); you do not need to specify any 
    environment variable as long as you keep the original structure of 
    the package;
  * mailing list for discussion: tetex@informatik.uni-hannover.de.
