To use txfonts with dvips, add follow line to your "config.ps" file.
--- add to config.ps ---
p +txr.map
--- end ---
Maybe "config.ps" is found from:
  /usr/local/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps  (print/teTeX)
  /usr/local/share/texmf/dvips/base/config.ps    (japanese/dvipsk)
If you found many "config.ps", then exec "kpsewhich psfonts.map".
True "config.ps" is in same directory with "psfonts.map".
