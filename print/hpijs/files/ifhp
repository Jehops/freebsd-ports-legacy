# This is the input filter that I use for my HP Deskjet 960c.
# If you are using a different model, you will have to change
# the -sDeviceModel= parameter below.  You will probably also
# want to change some of the other parameters. Check out the
# hpijs_readme.html file in /usr/local/share/doc/hpijs for
# more information on settings available per printer model.
# I use the ghostscript-afpl port, but this should work
# equally well with other types of gs.
#
# To use this, copy it into a handy location (the sample printcap
# file in this directory assumes /usr/local/etc/bin/), adjust
# /etc/printcap accordingly, adjust any settings below, start or
# restart lpd, and start printing!
#
# For more information, check out the handbook section on printing:
# http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/printing.html

#  Send a reset, then Treat LF as CR+LF:
