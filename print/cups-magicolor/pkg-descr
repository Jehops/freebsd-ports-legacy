The Konica-Minolta MagiColor 2430DL is one of the few color laser printers
that fully supports open source.  They have provided a CUPS filter,
rastertokmlf, that translates the CUPS raster format to the PCL-like
"LavaFlow" format expected by the printer.  The filter uses littleCMS
for color matching and their package also provides a complete PPD file
for the 2430DL.

The FreeBSD port patches the original package to take advantage of the
actual configuration of CUPS (the original package depended on a static
configuration based on CUPS 1.1.15) and to put the various files in their
proper places according to FreeBSD standards.
