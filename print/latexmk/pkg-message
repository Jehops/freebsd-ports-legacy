======================================================================

  In order for the 'pvc' (preview continuously) option to work 
  perfectly, latexmk needs to know the correct way to invoke ps(1) 
  in each operating system. Thus, users may have to change the $pscmd 
  variable in their ~/.latexmkrc files.
  
  For FreeBSD-4.x the following is known to work:
  $pscmd = "ps -w -f -u $ENV{USER}"
