LatexMk completely automates the process of generating a LaTeX document.
Essentially, it is a highly specialized relative of the general make
utility. Given the source files for a document, latexmk issues the
appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf or
hardcopy version of the document. It can also be set to run continuously
with a previewer; the needed commands are rerun whenever one of the
source files is modified.
