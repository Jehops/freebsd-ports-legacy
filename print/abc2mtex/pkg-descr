abc2mtex converts the "abc" music notation into MusiXTeX format.  This
can help simplifying writing tunes in a TeX format.

The abc2mtex user documentation is installed as
${PREFIX:-/usr/local}/share/texmf/doc/abc2mtex/usrguide.ps, and a few
examples can be found there in another subdirectory called `examples'.

Note that the original programs `search' and `sort_in' have been
renamed to `abc_search' and `abc_sort_in', respectively, to make their
purpose clearer.
