This port has a modified filter "filter800.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips800/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips800          env LANG=fr pips800	  
  env LANG=de pips800             env LANG=es pips800	  
  env LANG=it pips800             env LANG=nl pips800
  env LANG=pt pips800             env LANG=ko pips800 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips800 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips800 (**)
