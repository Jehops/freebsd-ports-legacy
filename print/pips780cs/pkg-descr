This port has a modified filter "filter780cs.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips780cs/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips780cs          env LANG=fr pips780cs	  
  env LANG=de pips780cs             env LANG=es pips780cs	  
  env LANG=it pips780cs             env LANG=nl pips780cs
  env LANG=pt pips780cs             env LANG=ko pips780cs (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips780cs (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips780cs (**)
