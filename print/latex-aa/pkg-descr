LaTeX2e class for submission to the scientific journal Astronomy and
Astrophysics.

In order to ensure the smoothest transition for both authors and
publishers, Springer-Verlag has kindly granted EDP Sciences the
permission to use the LaTeX macro package that they developed for A&A
Main journal.

Only minor changes have been incorporated between the Springer class
(1999) and the EDP Sciences class for the new journal.
