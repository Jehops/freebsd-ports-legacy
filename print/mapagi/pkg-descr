Mapagi is a pagination utility that prints your images/comics in
'in folio' format.

To produce a book printed in folio format, the sheet of paper is
folded once, producing 2 leaves. Each leaf has 2 sides, the recto
(front) and the verso (back).

Page size format is "Tankobon", probably well known to anime/manga
fans.
