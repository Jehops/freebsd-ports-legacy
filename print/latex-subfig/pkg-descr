Subfig Style:

This is a LaTeX package that supports the inclusion of small "sub" figures
and tables. It simplifies the positioning, captioning and labeling of them
within a single figure or table environment. 

The subfig package replaces the older subfigure package, but is not
completely backward compatible with it.  Therefore the name has changed to
insure that the older package will remain around awhile, however the use of
the older subfigure package is discouraged.
