This port is for a printer filter of EPSON Stylus Color 580. The filter
is called Photo Image Print System for Linux and there exist the
filters for other EPSON bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. It
supports English, French, Germany, Spanish, Italian and Portugue. See

This port has a modified filter "filter-sc580.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips-sc580/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips-sc580          env LANG=fr pips-sc580	  
  env LANG=de pips-sc580             env LANG=es pips-sc580	  
  env LANG=it pips-sc580             env LANG=nl pips-sc580
  env LANG=pt pips-sc580             env LANG=ko pips-sc580 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips-sc580 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips-sc580 (**)
