This is a package of libraries to use the FreeType library from the
perl language. It contains following pieces.

<FreeType.xs> This is a simple caller of the FreeType library. It has
same API as the FreeType library, so please read a manual of that to
understand how to use this.

<FreeTypeWrapper.pm> This is a simple wrapper of FreeType.xs to use
the FreeType library from perl with easy, perl-like API.

<ftinfo.pl> This is a dumper of a lot of information in each TrueType
fonts. This convert them as human readable strings.

<mkttfdir.pl> This is a maker of fonts.dir by parsing TTF and TTC
fils. It has special handler for DynaLab fonts, so it make good
fonts.dir automatically. And it detects what language's fonts are
contained in it by looking at code_page_range field in os2 table, so
it makes right entries.

Note that ftinfo core-dumps with a signal 11 in case using
perl5.00502. :-)
