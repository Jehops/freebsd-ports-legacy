Adobe(R) Acrobat(R) Viewer lets you view Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
files on all platforms that have a Java(TM) Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

If you already have Adobe Acrobat Reader, you won't need Acrobat Viewer. But if
there is no available version of Acrobat Reader for your system, and you have a
Java Virtual Machine installed, then Acrobat Viewer is for you. Written
entirely in Java, Acrobat Viewer can be used as an application or a JavaBean.

Acrobat Viewer can be licensed for free to be bundled with Java-related
products, or integrated into custom Java solutions through the JavaBean
interface. Please read the End User License Agreement for details.
