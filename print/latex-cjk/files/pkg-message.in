************************************************************************
CJK is now installed. You may use bg5latex or gbklatex to write in
BIG5 or GB encoding.

If you want to install other TTF fonts, you have to manually modify:
 %%TEXMFDIR%%/ttf2pk/ttfonts.map, for PK/Type 3 fonts;
 %%TEXMFDIR%%/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/c00kai.fd and
  %%TEXMFDIR%%/tex/latex/CJK/GB/c10kai.fd for Kai family fonts;
 %%TEXMFDIR%%/tex/latex/CJK/Bg5/c00song.fd and
  %%TEXMFDIR%%/tex/latex/CJK/GB/c10song.fd for Sung family fonts.
Then use ttf2tfm to generate corresponding tfm files.


                       <<<<< TIPS >>>>>

1. To embed Type 3 fonts in PostScript/PDF files or to use DVIPDFMx
   for TrueType fonts embedded and CID-keyed PDF files, use the 
   following basic font names:

     \begin{CJK}{Bg5}{song}
     \begin{CJK}{Bg5}{kai}
     \begin{CJK}{GB}{song}
     \begin{CJK}{GB}{kai}

2. By using "ccmap" with CJK, PDF generated by PDFTeX ("ccmap" does NOT
   work with LaTeX, DVIPS, DVIPDFm, etc.) may be searched for Chinese
   text, and may be copied Chinese text from, when viewed in Adobe Reader.
   BIG5, BIG5+, GB2312, GBK, JIS and UTF-8 are supported (Korean is
   supported ONLY in UTF-8 so far). This implementation is based on
   PDFTeX's CID support.

   Usage:

      \usepackage{ccmap}
      \usepackage{CJK}
      ...

   The package "ccmap" is a part of "CCT", an alternative to CJK,
   another excellent Chinese support package for LaTeX, developped
   and maintained by Lin-bo Zhang <zlb@lsec.cc.ac.cn>, Institute of
   Computational Mathematics and Scientific/Engineering Computing,
   China Academy of Science. See:
       http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cct/
       ftp://ftp.cc.ac.cn/pub/cct/
   The package "ccmap" is rewritten by Wen-chang Sun
   <sunwch@nankai.edu.cn>, School of Mathematical Science, Nankai
   University, based on "cmap" package by Vladimir Volovich
   <vvv@vsu.ru>.

3. Except with DVIPDFM, you may use pseudo-italic Chinese fonts by:
       \textit{...}    or      \textsl{...}

4. To use PDFTeX DIRECTLY with TrueType fonts for TrueType fonts
   embedded PDF file, please run (see ATTENTION below):

       cat `kpsewhich CJK-pdftex.map` >> `kpsewhich pdftex.map`

   This command injects PDFTeX-specific configuration for TrueType
   into PDFTeX's own configuration file.

   See also the above introduction to "ccmap" for PDFTeX's CID support.

   ATTENTION: Due to PDFTeX's bug (version < 1.30.0) against Arphic
   free BIG5 TrueType fonts' bugs, PDFTeX exits abnormally when using
   "AR PL Mingti2L Big5" ("ShanHeiSun-Light") and "AR PL KaitiM Big5"
   ("ZenKai-Medium"). See

http://sarovar.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=306&group_id=106&atid=493

   NOTE: PDFTeX-specific configuration will be eliminated by running
   "updmap" or "updmay-sys". After that, you MUST RE-RUN the above
   command to do RE-INJECTING.

5. Use these font names in UTF-8 TeX files (if UTF-8 support is enabled):

     \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{b5song}  % Arphic Mingti, BIG5 glyphs covered
     \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{b5kai}   % Arphic Kaiti,  BIG5 glyphs covered
     \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsong}  % Arphic Songti, GB2312 glyphs covered
     \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbkai}   % Arphic Kaiti,  GB2312 glyphs covered

6. If you want to use Type 1 fonts, use the following font names:

     \begin{CJK}{Bg5}{t1song}
     \begin{CJK}{Bg5}{t1kai}
     \begin{CJK}{GB}{t1song}
     \begin{CJK}{GB}{t1kai}

   But to be honest, they look VERY BAD in Adobe Reader (but fine
   in Xpdf and GhostScript), though they are REAL SCALABLE fonts
   and may be enlarged by any ratio.

To see these tips again, run

     pkg_info -D zh-CJK-\* | less

Happy CJKing!
