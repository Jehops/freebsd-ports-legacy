Welcome to CJK, a LaTeX2e macro package which enables the use of CJK
scripts (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) in various encodings.

Features of this port:

  lauguages, you have to supply those TTF fonts, then manually modify
  relative settings.
- basic Type 3 font support and cooperate with DVIPDFMx
- a package "ccmap" from CCT for PDFTeX's CID support
- pseudo-italic and pseudo-bold Chinese font support
- configure PDFTeX to use TrueType fonts directly

- Type 1 scalable font support for Arphic free fonts

For more tips of using these features, please run this command
after installation:
