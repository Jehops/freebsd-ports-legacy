This package has been compiled with some defaults:
1 fonts will be created in ${localbase}/share/texmf/fonts/pk and this
  directory will be made world writable

2 300 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=imagen
  200 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=FAX
  360 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nextII
  400 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nexthi
   72 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nextscreen

If you are not satisfied with 1, you need to recompile xdvi
If you are not satisfied with 2, you will need to edit $prefix/bin/MakeTeXPK
