This port has a modified filter "filter920.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips920/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips920          env LANG=fr pips920	  
  env LANG=de pips920             env LANG=es pips920

  env LANG=pt pips920             env LANG=ko pips920 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips920 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips920 (**)
