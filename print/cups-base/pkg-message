======================================================================

CUPS is now installed.

Please read the documentation in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/cups/ for information
on how to set up your printer to use CUPS. Basic template configuration files
have been installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/cups/

To install the BSD and system V compatibility binaries look to the port
print/cups-lpr. These are no longer installed as part of the base cups port
because they have conflicting names with the native print binaries, and with
other ports, such as lprNG.

NOTE: IF YOU USE A NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTER:

You will need to install the cups-pstoraster port in order to print to
your printer. If you installed via the "cups" port, it will be installed
automatically. Otherwise, you will need to install the port or the package
yourself.
