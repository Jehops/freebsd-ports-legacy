CUPS is now installed.

Please read the documentation in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/cups/ for information
on how to set up your printer to use CUPS. Basic template configuration files
have been installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/cups/

To install the BSD and system V compatibility binaries look to the port
print/cups-bin. These are no longer installed as part of the base cups port
because they have conflicting names with the native print binaries, and with
other ports, such as lprNG.
