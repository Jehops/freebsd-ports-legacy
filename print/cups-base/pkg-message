This package does not create the spool directory, due to limitations in
the packaging mechanism, or my knowledge of it.

Once the package is installed, please do the following (as root):

	cd /var/spool
	mkdir -p cups/tmp
	chown -R root:daemon cups

There's another problem: in the installed configuration, the "Print Test
Page" function in the web interface does not work. This is due to a bug in
the URL constructed for it.

To work around this bug, edit the file /usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf
(as root). Find the line that says "Allow From 127.0.0.1". After that
line, insert a line that reads "Allow From <myhost>.<mydomain>", filling
in your own hostname and domainname where I have written <myhost> and 
<mydomain>. Restart cupsd. The "Print Test Page" function will now work.

I'll try to have a code patch to fix the errant URL soon.

Thanks.
