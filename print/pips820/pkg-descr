This port has a modified filter "filter820.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips820/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips820          env LANG=fr pips820	  
  env LANG=de pips820             env LANG=es pips820

  env LANG=pt pips820             env LANG=ko pips820 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips820 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips820 (**)
