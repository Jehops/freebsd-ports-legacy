dvi2tty is a simple utility which displays a dvi file on a text only
device, say a terminal or a line printer. 

The output is not perfect but it does give you a basic idea of what
the final text would look like. I personally use this utility for the
first step in converting a dvi file into a text file.

This program comes from the CTAN archive and it not currently being
maintained by anyone. Please see the README files in the distribution
for more information.

Share and enjoy,
