Note: in order to use the script "dvipdf", dvips must be installed.
This program may be provided by either print/dvips or print/dvipsk-tetex
(print/dvipsk-tetex may be preferable since it doesn't conflict with
tetex things).

FAPIfontmap and FAPIcidfmap in %%DATADIR%%/%%PORTVERSION%%/Resource/Init
have to be configured if you want to use FAPI feature.
