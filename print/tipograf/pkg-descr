Tipograf is a frontend for the powerful anything to PostScript converter a2ps.
By principle, the command line is more powerful than any graphical user
interface, but for the average user memorization of all the program specific
options is too time consuming. I think that's the reason why some people prefer
less functional GUI programs over sophisticated command line tools. Tipograf
solves this problem in the case of a2ps.
