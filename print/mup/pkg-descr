The music publisher program called Mup takes a text file describing
music as input, and generates PostScript output for printing that music.
The input file can be created using your favorite text editor, or generated
from any other source, such as another program. The input must be written
in a special language designed especially for describing music. The majority
of the Mup User's Guide is the explanation of this language and how to use it.
