This port has a modified filter "filter820ug.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips820ug/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips820ug          env LANG=fr pips820ug	  
  env LANG=de pips820ug             env LANG=es pips820ug	  
  env LANG=it pips820ug             env LANG=nl pips820ug
  env LANG=pt pips820ug             env LANG=ko pips820ug (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips820ug (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips820ug (**)
