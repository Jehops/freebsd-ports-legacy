This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F860. The filter is
called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux and there exist the
filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the
below URLs:

And then this port has filters filter860 and filter860_gui which are
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it and connect it
via "ulpt", you add the next entry into /etc/printcap.

bjfilter860|Canon BJ F860:\
        :lp=/dev/ulpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter860/filter860:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter860:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs
bjfilter860_gui|Canon BJ F860 with GUI:\
        :lp=/dev/ulpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter860/filter860_gui:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter860_gui:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs

Notice: If you use filter860_gui in the printer server, for example
hostA then you have to run X, execute "xhost hostA" and execute "lpr" on
the host which you are using.
