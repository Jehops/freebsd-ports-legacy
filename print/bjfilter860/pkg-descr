This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F860. The filter is
called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux and there exist the
filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the
below URLs:

And then this port has filters filter860 and filter860_gui which are
useful to print out more than one page. If you use it, you add the
next entry into /etc/printcap.

bjfilter860|Canon BJ F860:\
        :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter860/filter860:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter860:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs
bjfilter860_gui|Canon BJ F860 with GUI:\
        :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
        :sh:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter860/filter860_gui:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/bjfilter860_gui:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lf=/var/log/lpd-errs

Notice: If you use filter860_gui then the host which you are using
have to be the printer saver. Then before using it, you have to run X
and execute "xhost localhost".
