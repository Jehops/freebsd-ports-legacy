This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of ftp/wget built with SSL (default)
  AUTHOR:  sf@FreeBSD.org

  wget 1.10 now authenticates certificate of remote host before making a
  SSL connection. To make it work, you should have working CA root
  certificates list in /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

  If you don't have it there are options:
  a) install security/ca-roots port and you have done.
  b) install ftp/curl port and symlink it to /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
      ln -s /usr/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  c) put your favorite one into certain place.

20050601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/perforce
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Upgrading to 2005.1 is straightforward, but it is highly recommended
  to follow the upgrading instructions in the release notes:
    http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.051/user/relnotes.txt

20050526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sylpheed-claws
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  Sylpheed-claws is updated to the GTK2 version now. This results in a new
  configuration directory. To keep your konfiguration from the GTK1 version
  you can
      cp -rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2
  before starting the GTK2 version for the first time, or
      cp -Rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2/
  when you have run the GTK2 version already.

20050524:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mpeg4ip and multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.3 mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installs libmp4av that mpeg4ip
  previously installed. It is advised to de-install mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and
  mpeg4ip before updating to mpeg4ip-1.3 or mpeg4ip-libmp4v2-1.3. If you
  have already updated mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and mpeg4ip you should deinstall
  mpeg4ip and reinstall mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 before updating mpeg4ip.

  This does not affect users who just have mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installed
  and not mpeg4ip.

20050523:
  AFFECTS: users of games/pvgdn
  AUTHOR: mek@mek.uz.ua

  The following has been changed in the bnetd.conf file (starting with
  version 1.7.7):
    - The old config variable `servername' has been renamed to `hostname'.
    - A new `servername' config variable has been introduced for server
      identification.

20050519:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  Starting with 2.5.10, the cachemgr.cgi program uses a configuration file
  cachemgr.conf to control which hosts this program is allowed to manage.
  To prevent abuse, the configuration defaults to "localhost" only.
  Please see cachemgr.cgi(8) for further details.

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2 and all ports depending on it
  AUTHOR: lars.eggert@gmx.net.

  API changed for mod_perl2 - existing code will break!
  The mod_perl2 developers have significantly changed the API
  in release candidate 2.0.0-RC5. These changes include changed
  names for core packages, causing software that uses the old API
  to fail with the new version. You need to update your code as
  described in http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/rename.html

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird
  AUTHOR: freebsd@galle.com.br

  The port was split into a -server and -client parts.
  The -server contains server binary, UDFs, and install all in
  ${PREFIX}/firebird. The -client contains libs, includes,
  client binaries, docs and examples. For migration delete
  the firebird port and install the -server and/or -client port
  afterwards.

20050512:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/svk
  AUTHOR: rafan@infor.org

  Since SVK 0.30, it is fast enough and PPerl causes some problems.
  Thus, the SVK port no longer supports WITH_PPERL knob.
  If you still want to use PPerl with it, please go and read:
  http://svk.elixus.org/?SVKAndPPerl for details.

20050511:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg{,-devel}
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  The latest FreeBSD CVS snapshot has been committed under
  multimedia/ffmepg-devel. In order to build it, you need to deinstall
  any ffmpeg ports first.

  # pkg_deinstall multimedia/ffmpeg

  Futhermore, video capture is no longer working in the latest
  version. Work is been done to overcome this.

20050511:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|contrib)
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports have been updated to latest versions. A
  security problem in the template database requires a simple SQL
  command to be run on each database. because these problems are
  really incorrect system catalog entries. Updating to a new release
  will NOT by itself solve the problems in an existing
  installation.

  See http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.315 for details.

20050501:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml based applications and libraries
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent update of ocaml to 3.08.3 some API compability
  has been broken. It is a bit subtle so that some users might not
  notice it. However, updating all ocaml based aplications and
  libraries are advised using the new compiler/interpreter version.
  Issue the following command:

  	# portupgrade -rf 'ocaml*'

20050426:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-authlib
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  mail/courier-authlib has been moved to security/courier-authlib and is
  now only a meta-port. Installing the meta-port installs security/
  courier-authlib-base and no, one or more sub-ports regarding to what
  authentification methods you've choosen. Courier-authlib-base only
  provides you athentification via PAM. All ports depending on courier-
  authlib (at the time of writing, courier-imap, sqwebmail and maildrop)
  giving you the same choice the meta-port provides you.

20050421:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera-devel
  AUTHOR: avleeuwen@piwebs.com

  Opera 8.0 final has been released and can be installed by installing the
  www/opera port. The opera-devel port is now deprecated. If you want
  to continue using the personal settings you used with www/opera-devel,
  issue this command:

	# mv ~/.opera-devel ~/.opera

20050421:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: avleeuwen@piwebs.com

  Opera has been updated to 8.0. If are upgrading from version 7.x or
  below, it is recommend that you backup your personal "~/.opera"
  directory and remove it, like this:

        # cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-bak
        # rm -rf ~/.opera/*

  After that, you can put your bookmarks, email, contacts, etc. back in
  ~/.opera/. The most important files are your bookmarks
  (~/.opera/opera6.adr) and your emails (~/.opera/mail). It is not a good
  idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini, pluginpath.ini and other
  non-personal stuff back in ~/.opera/. If you need custom settings,
  reconfigure Opera from the preferences pane or edit the files by hand.

20050420:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ipython
  AUTHOR: dryice@liu.com.cn

  This is backward-incompatible changes for pysh.

  1. You must update your pysh profile (~/.ipython/ipythonrc-pysh):
     a) Add to it the line:
        import_all IPython.Extensions.InterpreterExec
     b) Delete the line
        execfile pysh.py
  2. You must also delete from ~/.ipython/ the file pysh.py.

20050419:
  AFFECTS: users of linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Opera has been updated to 8.0. If you are upgrade from version 7.x or
  below, it is recommend for you to backup your personal "~/.linux-opera"
  directory and remove it. It can be done following from the command line:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak
	# rm -rf ~/.linux-opera/*

  After that, you can put your bookmark, email, contacts and etc back in
  ~/.linux-opera/. The bookmark is ~/.linux-opera/opera6.adr and the email is
  ~/.linux-opera/mail as you can figure out by view in ~/.linux-opera/. It is
  probably not good idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini,
  pluginpath.ini and other non-personal stuff back in ~/.linux-opera/. The
  non-personal stuff should be re-configure on new stuff by either Opera
  preferences in GUI or hand (manual) in your editor.

20050415:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/cricket
  AUTHOR: ijliao@FreeBSD.org

  As of 2004/11/09 cricket uses a separate user "wwwadm". If you
  upgrade your installtion, make sure you chown your existing data.

20050414:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports are updated to 8.0.2. All shared libraries'
  versions have been bumped, so you will need to recompile all client
  applications that depend on libpq.so. The recommended way to
  upgrade from 8.0.x would be something like

  	portupgrade -rf postgresql-client

20050413:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamd
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  spamd now installs a rcNG script for starting the OpenBSD pf spamd daemon.
  To enable that at boot time, add the following into /etc/rc.conf[.local]:

  pfspamd_enable="YES"

20050413
  AFFECTS: users of www/quixote
  AUTHOR: dryice@liu.com.cn

  There are backward-incompatible changes upgrading from 1.2 to
  2.0. Including renaming quixote.form to quixote.form1 and
  quixote.form2 to quixote.form. Please refer to upgrading.txt in the
  docs dir for detail.

20050411:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/gdm
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  GDM now installs a rcNG script for starting the gdm daemon.
  To enable that gdm starts a boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  gdm_enable="YES"

20050406:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql50-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

20050403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/tac_plus4
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Tac_plus4 now installs an rcNG script for starting the tac_plus daemon.
  To enable tac_plus to start at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  tac_plus_enable="YES"

  You can also pass flags to tac_plus by setting the rc.conf variable
  tac_plus_flags.  The default flags are "-C ${PREFIX}/etc/tac_plus.conf".

  Additionally, the default version of IOS for tac_plus has been changed from
  11.x to 12.x.

20050324:
  AFFECTS: users of net/mDNSResponder
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  In mDNSResponder 98_1, mdnsd is no longer started by default due to a
  switch to an rc.subr startup script.  To start it, you must add add
  mdnsd_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf or other suitable
  configuration file.

20050320:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3, x11-themes/kdeartwork3, www/akregator, x11-themes/phase, multimedia/kdemultimedia3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  In KDE 3.4, a number of files were moved between ports, some ports
  were added, one port has been removed and some applictions formerly available
  in their own ports were incorporated into KDE. This means that you will have
  to take some precautions to update your KDE installation. A simple
  portupgrade -a will not work.

  Portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behaviour and crashes from applications launched until you log out and back
  in.

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeartwork-\[0-9\]\* kdebase-\[0-9\]\* \
	kdebase-konqueror-nsplugins-\[0-9\]\* kdewebdev-\[0-9\]\* \
	kde-\[0-9\]\* akregator\* phase\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

      	portinstall -O kdebase kdeartwork kdewebdev

   Changes in detail:

	- www/akregator is now included into deskutils/kdepim3.
	- x11-themes/phase is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.
	- www/konqueror-nsplugins has been removed and is now integrated into
          x11/kdebase3.
	- Juk has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/juk.
	- Akode has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/akode and audio/akode-plugins-*. Akode is also
	  a default dependency of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 now.
	- audio/mpeglib_artsplug has been demoted to legacy status and is no
          longer the default decoder backend for kdemultimedia3. It's also not
          depended on by kdemultimedia3 by default anymore.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again (also see
    http://freebsd.kde.org/faq.php#q16).

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running (as root or with sudo)

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdm configuration (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration. Especially note that kdm does not use the Xservers
    file anymore. A genkdmconf run will merge its contents into kdmrc.

  Extensive information about changes and new features of KDE 3.4 can be found
  at http://developer.kde.org/development-versions/kde-3.4-features.html. Bugs
  can be reported at http://bugs.kde.org.

20050320:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portsnap
  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of shifting from SHA-1 to SHA-256, the structure of
  portsnap's configuration file and compressed snapshot have both
  changed.  After upgrading to portsnap 0.9, you will have to
  update your configuration file ($PREFIX/etc/portsnap.conf) and
  delete your existing portsnap compressed snapshot:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf
  	# rm -r /usr/local/portsnap/*

  In addition, be aware that the next runs of "portsnap fetch" and
  "portsnap update" will take far longer than usual, since they
  will need to download and extract a complete copy of the ports
  tree.

20050319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7[34]-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script has been merged from 8.0 to 7.3 and 7.4. Hence,
  to start the PostgreSQL server at boot time (regardless of version),
  add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  postgresql_enable=yes

20050318:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/blackbox, boxtools, bbkeys and bbpager
  AUTHOR: A.J.Caines@halplant.com

  The new blackbox ports include several changes to use and configuration.
  Please read the pkg-message files in the respective ports for details.

20050315:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql323-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The MySQL Daemon must now be enabled / disabled in rc.conf.
  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  See the script for details.

20050314:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql40-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

20050313:
  AFFECTS: users of games/netpanzerdata, games/netpanzer
  AUTHOR: mad@madpilot.net

  The netpanzerdata port has changed it's name to netpanzer-data,
  so before installing the new one you will need to remove the old
  netpanzerdata-0.1.3 port.

20050312:
  AFFECTS: all users who have glib/gtk/gnome libraries installed
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org and the FreeBSD gnome team

  Gnome has been upgraded to 2.10 and gtk/glib to 2.6.
  DO NOT USE portupgrade(1) to update any gnome or gtk
  or any port that depends on them. Using portupgrade
  will cause problems and you will have to manually
  upgrade ports.  Please use the gnome_upgrade.sh
  script from
    http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/gnome_upgrade.sh

20050309:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/maildrop
  AUTHOR: sergei@FreeBSD.org

  maildrop has been recently upgraded to 1.8.0. This version
  has the following changes:

  - Maildir quota is now enabled by default.
    The following options were deleted:
    - WITH_MAILDIRQUOTA
    - WITH_TRASHQUOTA
  - New option WITH_AUTHLIB is added, which provides optional support for
    Courier Auth Library (mail/courier-authlib port).
  - Userdb authentication, LDAP and MySQL support are provided through
    courier-authlib now, thus the following options
    - WITH_USERDB
    - WITH_LDAP
    - WITH_MYSQL
    have been superceded by WITH_AUTHLIB.

20050306:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  ploticus is now installed as bin/ploticus rather than bin/pl to
  avoid useless conflicts with other ports.

20050303:
  AFFECTS: users of net/i2p
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  The newest i2p version 0.5.0.1 is incompatible with all previous
  versions. Follow these procedures if you are updating from a
  previous port version. You can ignore these if you are installing
  i2p for the first time.

  1) Update i2p port to the new one
  2) Use the i2prouter script to uninstall i2p from user account.
     You are going to lose all your configuration.

  $ i2prouter uninstall

  3) Install the new i2p version

  $ i2prouter install

20050301:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ganglia-monitor-core
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  With the move to Ganglia 3.0.0, the configuration file for gmond has
  changed completely.  The -r or --convert options may be used to
  emit a file in the new format given one in the old.

  Startup is now controlled by an RC_SUBR script so the gmond_enable and
  gmetad_enable variables will need to be set for gmond and gmetad to be
  started.  Existing gmond.sh and gmetad.sh scripts in PREFIX/etc/rc.d
  should be removed.

  Due to a bug in ganglia's build process, the previous version may need
  to be removed before ganglia can be upgraded.

20050224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby18 and any apps that depend on ruby18
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The theads support has been disabled again. It causes the more trouble, so
  it now builds with ${PTHREAD_CFLAGS} and ${PTHREAD_LIBS}. It is recommend
  you to rebuild any apps that depend on lang/ruby18. Do something like this:

  	portupgrade -rf ruby-1.8.2\*

20050224:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache21
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from 2.1.2, you need to rebuild all apache modules.

20050215:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql41-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

20050214:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios
  AUTHOR: blaz@si.FreeBSD.org

  Nagios has been upgraded to 2.0.b2. Native support for storing various types
  of data (status, retention, comment, downtime, etc.) in MySQL and PostgreSQL
  has been dropped. There are also multiple changes to the format of
  configuration files. Carefully read
  http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/2_0/whatsnew.html before upgrading.

20050213:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX-* are now based on teTeX 3.0.  Although some
  reliability fixes are also added, here are several common problems
  which you might fall on.

  1) $PREFIX/bin/pdftex is missing:

   Probably your system has old files included teTeX 2.x which can
   prevent the new version from working.  Please remove the old
   files first (see 20050206 in this file) and reinstall.

  2) Some formats are still corrupted (for example, "Fatal format file error;
     I'm stymied" is displayed) or not updated even after a clean install:

   You might have old or corrupted *.fmt and/or *.map files
   under /root/.texmf-* or $HOME/.texmf-* directories.  Typically
   these directories are generated when you invoke the updmap(1),
   texconfig(1), or fmtutil(1) utility manually.  However, for a period
   after the first revision of the teTeX-base port erroneously used
   fmtutil(1) to regenerate *.fmt files, you could have these directories
   without your intent.  In such a case, please remove these directories
   and reinstall the ports (it is not needed to rebuild ports/packages).
   Just for your information, $HOME/.texmf-config and $HOME/.texmf-var
   can be used for your personal configuration.

  If you have other problems, please contact hrs@FreeBSD.org.

20050212:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/mkbold, mkitalic and mkbold-mkitalic
  AUTHOR: koma2@ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp

  The dependency on x11-fonts/mkbold and x11-fonts/mkitalic has been
  switched over to x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic, which is written in C
  and has far better performance than the old ones.  There is no
  functional difference between the two, but they will conflict with
  each other.  Since other ports which depend on x11-fonts/mkbold or
  x11-fonts/mkitalic will be updated to depend on x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic,
  you might get an error during upgrading such ports.  In such a case,
  please pkg_delete the old ones first.

20050206:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX and japanese/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX is now based on a teTeX 3.0 release candidate
  (2.99.13.20050204) and the other related ports are also updated.
  Since upgrading from previous versions should be done at a time,
  you may want to use the portupgrade utility or reinstall
  print/teTeX after deinstalling all of the related ports.

  If your teTeX environment became broken during the upgrade,
  please see the following URL which explains how to fix it.

  http://people.freebsd.org/~hrs/tetex-upgrade.txt

  This file also includes notes for people who are familiar
  with the teTeX distribution to explain structure of the ports.

20050205:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby16_r, lang/ruby18_r and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  The slippery pthread support for systems prior to 502102 has been
  dropped and lang/ruby16_r and lang/ruby18_r ports have been removed,
  since no one seems to appreciate the partially working solution.

  Good news is that the pthread support of lang/ruby18 is now enabled
  by default for newer systems, which means the ruby interpreter is
  linked with libpthread.  This will allow threaded extension
  libraries to run and work properly on those systems.

20050201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5 and lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5 has been updated to 5.6.2, and lang/perl5.8 has been
  updated to 5.8.6. you should update everything depending on perl, that
  is:

    * first, upgrade your perl installation (use either lang/perl5 or
      lang/perl5.8, the latter being recommended);
    * for FreeBSD 4.X, run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you
      have 5.8.6 or 5.6.2;  this step is not needed on FreeBSD 5.X and
      FreeBSD -CURRENT;
    * run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5\* |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.[68].[1245] -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards by hand.

  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  Each of the PostgreSQL ports have been split into a server and a
  client part. Please use postgresqlNN-server and/or
  postgresqlNN-client as needed. Versions currently supported are 7.3,
  7.4 and 8.0.

  To start the PostgreSQL server at boot time, add the following to
  /etc/rc.conf:

  postgresql_enable=yes

  The maintainance script is installed in etc/periodic/daily, and is
  controlled by a set of new knobs in periodic.conf. Use it for
  vacuuming your databases and get daily backups. Note that daily
  vacuuming is on by default. See the script for details.

  AFFECTS: users of net/howl
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Howl now installs an rcNG script for starting mDNSResponder.  To enable
  mDNSResponder to start at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  mdnsresponder_enable="YES"

  You can also pass flags to mDNSResponder by setting the rc.conf variable
  mdnsresponder_flags to the appropriate value.  See the mDNSResponder(8)
  man page for the list of supported flags.  The default is not to pass
  any flags to mDNSResponder.

  If you use Xorg 6.8.1: Make shure there is an /tmp/.ICE-unix with propper
  rights. For further informations about that, please refer to 20041229
  Please update all your plugins as well when you update from 4.0.6 to 4.2
  They all need recompiling to link against the new xfce libraries

20050122:
  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: seanc@FreeBSD.org

  The -devel port has been updated to contain 8.0 release since
  postgresql80-server can not be updated until 4.11 is released and the
  changes in PR ports/75344 are committed.  Users who need 8.0 now can
  use the -devel port, however, once postgresql80-server has been
  committed, -devel will begin tracking 8.1.  Please be smart about
  tracking ports and if used in production, update to
  databases/postgresql80-server as soon as it becomes available.  No
  dump/reload will be required when changing from -devel to
  postgresql80-server.

20050117:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spambnc
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

The SpamBouncer has been upgraded from version 1.9 to 2.0-RC3, and you

/usr/local/share/doc/spambnc.

20050117:
  AFFECTS: users of astk-client
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

ASTK has been moved; if there exists files $HOME/.astkrc/config_serveurs,
you have to update the entry rep_serv from /usr/local/ASTK/ASTK_SERV/bin
to /usr/local/aster/ASTK/ASTK_SERV/bin (or you can remove $HOME/.astkrc).

20050114:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgnomesu, esp. on FreeBSD 4.x.
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  If you installed libgnomesu the day it was added to the ports tree,
  you have a malformed PAM control file in /etc/pam.d/. All libgnomesu
  users should remove /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam, and 5.x users should
  replace it with the version in the updated libgnomesu port (ensure
  that you're using the most current revision of the libgnomesu port).

  4.x users: listen up! The presence of the /etc/pam.d/ directory (and
  anything in that directory) presents a Very Bad Thing. Unless you've
  manually tweaked your PAM settings, you must run:

  	# rm /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam
  	# rmdir /etc/pam.d/

  or all users will be locked out of your system!

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/iip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  iip has been updated to the new network servers. Therefore, both
  old configuration files and node reference keys no longer apply.

  Therefore, you need to update the configuration files for each
  user running the iip isproxy daemon:

  1) Backup configuration files

  cp ~/.iip/isproxy.ini ~/.iip/isproxy.ini.backup
  cp ~/.iip/node.ref ~/.iip/node.ref.backup

  2) Remove configuration files

  rm ~/.iip/isproxy.ini
  rm ~/.iip/node.ref

  3) Create new configuration. Fill information as requested. This
  creates the updated isproxy.ini file

  isproxy -C

  4) Start iip isproxy. This will initialize your updated node.ref
  file. This file will be automatically updated when you connect
  to the iip network

  isproxy

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nautilus-cd-burner
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Nautilus-cd-burner now requires cdrtools built with UTF-8 encoding
  support.  The default sysutils/cdrtools port does not support this
  encoding, and that will cause nautilus-cd-burner to enter an infinite
  loop when trying to create CD images.  To workaround this, the cdrtools
  dependency was changed in nautilus-cd-burner to point to the
  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port instead.

  Since sysutils/cdrtools and sysutils/cdrtools-cjk conflict, you must
  uninstall cdrtools so that the nautilus-cd-burner update can properly
  pull in cdrtools-cjk.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap, mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-imap and sqwebmail are now dependent on courier-authlib. If
  you've changed the default authentication config for courier-imap or
  sqwebmail, you will have to redo the changes for courier-authlib.
  You may wish to deinstall courier-imap and/or sqwebmail before you
  install courier-authlib. Since courier-authlib replaces parts of both
  ports, some of courier-authlib's files are listed as sqwebmail and
  courier-imap files and deinstalling old courier-imap and/or sqwebmail
  port may cause the deinstallation of the freshly installed
  courier-authlib files.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Sqwebmail now installs it's files directly under PREFIX. That means for
  instance that files that were formerly found under
  PREFIX/share/sqwebmail/etc/ are now located under PREFIX/etc/sqwebmail.
  Furthermore you need to set sqwebmaild_enable=YES in your rc.conf
  because the rc.d script has been migrated to use the rc.subr Subsystem

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  The variable courier_imap_imapdssl_enable have been renamed to
  courier_imap_imapd_ssl_enable.
  The variable courier_imap_pop3dssl_enable have been renamed to
  courier_imap_pop3d_ssl_enable.
  userdb stuff is now located in LOCALBASE/etc/authlib instead of
  LOCALBASE/etc.

20041231:
  AFFECTS: users of the linux compatibility environment
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The default linux_base was changed from v7 to v8. You need to update from
  v7 to v8 and rebuild every linux port. To update run:
	portupgrade -rf -o emulators/linux_base-8 emulators/linux_base

  In case you already use linux_base-8 you have to run:
	portupgrade -rf emulators/linux_base-8

20041229:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3, x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  If KDE does not start anymore after upgrading Xorg to version 6.8.1
  (X restarts when the KDE splash screen has reached the third icon),
  please check whether the directory /tmp/.ICE-unix exists, is owned by root
  and has permissions 1777 (read/write/access for everybody + sticky bit).

  To make sure everything is in working order, do (as root):
  mkdir -p /tmp/.ICE-unix && chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix &&
  chown root:wheel /tmp/.ICE-unix

  Also, make sure you do NOT have clear_tmp_enable="YES" set in /etc/rc.conf,
  as it will remove the directory on every reboot and applications will re-
  create it with the wrong ownership.

  Users of daily_clean_tmps_enable in /etc/periodic.conf should make sure
  daily_clean_tmps_ignore contains /tmp/.ICE-unix.

20041227:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/gambas

  AFFECTS: users of Horde and the related ports (Turba, IMP, Nag, Kronolith,
           Mnemo, Chora)
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  As of this update, the configuration files are generated by the application,
  with no support for configuration files used in previous versions.

  All data saved in the database, LDAP or MCAL backends will be preserved,
  considering that you run specific scripts to migrate to this new scheme.
  Affected ports are www/horde, mail/turba, deskutils/nag, deskutils/kronolith,
  and deskutils/mnemo. See the UPGRADING documentation of the ports in question
  for more details.

  The filter system of IMP 3.x has been replaced by a separate application:
  check the port mail/ingo. Ingo provides a script to migrate the existing
  filter rules from IMP 3.x, see Ingo's documentation.

20041224:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/XFree86-4-Server and graphics/dri
  AUTHOR: lesi@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 4.4.0_6, XFree86-4-Server now depends on
  graphics/xfree86-dri.  This is due to incompatibilities between
  XFree86 and the new xorg 6.8.1 DRI.

  Users of XFree86-4-Server are strongly encouraged to switch to
  the xfree86-dri port as follows:

	portupgrade -fo graphics/xfree86-dri graphics/dri

  which will also fix dependencies.

20041224:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Please upgrade sysutils/portupgrade prior to lang/ruby18, or
  pkgdb(1) may coredump with a double free() problem from a misuse (or
  a "feature") of the DL module.

  In that case, you can reinstall sysutils/portupgrade manually.

20041222:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav, security/clamav-devel
  AUTHOR: jylefort@brutele.be

  The ClamAV database path has changed from /usr/local/share/clamav to
  /var/db/clamav. You should update the DatabaseDirectory keyword in
  /usr/local/etc/clamd.conf and /usr/local/etc/freshclam.conf.

20041221
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme03
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  security/gpgme03 has been modified to not conflicts with gpgme 1.x
  After upgrade, you need to rebuild all ports that depend on it.
  You should upgrade security/gpgme (if installed) to avoid nasty
  compile time failures, due to original location of gpgme.h.

20041219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/jdictionary
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The location for JDictionary port installed files has changed. This also
  affects the various plugins. Hence, users should upgrade all jdictionary
  related ports at once to avoid inconsistencies:

  $ portupgrade jdictionary\*

20041213:
  AFFECTS: users of security/cryptplug, deskutils/kdepim3
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  The cryptplug port is not compatible with recent versions of gpgme
  and has been changed to depend on gpgme03 (the last version of gpg-
  me compatible with cryptplug).
  Users who have been using cryptplug in order to enable PGP/MIME support
  in KMail should DEINSTALL BOTH cryptplug and gpgme03 before updating
  KDE to version 3.3.2. Cryptplug is NOT necessary anymore to enable
  PGP/MIME support in KMail and will cause the kdepim3 build to fail due
  to conflicting dependencies.

20041213:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-relay
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL Relay must now be enabled / disabled in rc.conf:
    postgresqlrelay_enable="YES"

20041212:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula
  AUTHOR: lkoeller@FreeBSD.org

  The port was split into a -server and -client component.
  The -server part contains the storage and director daemon, the -client
  part the console, file daemon and the documentation.

  For migration delete the bacula port and install the -server and/or
  -client port afterwards.

20041208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/getmail
  AUTHOR: question+fbsdports@closedsrc.org

  There is a known quirk when using mail/getmail with Python 2.4
  where the DeprecationWarning is printed regarding the use of
  the 'strict' keyword when a message is being retrieved.

  You can redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null to quelch the warning.

  The quirk may be fixed in a future version of getmail.

20041205:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/ffmpeg will not work if previous versions of the port
  are installed. Also, there is a shared library version bump on
  this update. Therefore:

  1) Remove old ffmpeg

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/ffmpeg*

  2) Install updated ffmpeg

  3) Rebuild all ports that depend on ffmpeg due to the shared
  library version bump

  cd /var/db/pkg && portupgrade -rf ffmpeg* -x ffmpeg*

20041202:
  AFFECTS: users of any ports which have dependency on lang/python
  AUTHOR: perky@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading of lang/python, you must rebuild all its consumer
  ports to make them get ready to Python 2.4.

  To do this, you will need to:
    pkgdb -uf && cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

    cp -R ~/.rawdog ~/.rawdog-old
    rm ~/.rawdog/state
    rawdog -u
    rawdog --upgrade ~/.rawdog-old ~/.rawdog
    rawdog -w

  Once you're happy with the new version:
    rm -r ~/.rawdog-old

20041118:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  portsdb(1) is part of the portupgrade suite and is used to convert a ports
  INDEX file to a binary INDEX.db database. By default, it uses the
  libc-builtin berkeley db to do so, which has a buggy btree implementation.

  If you see errors like "[BUG] Segmentation fault" while a portsdb update is
  in progress, adjust the PORTS_DBDRIVER variable (in your environment or in
  pkgtools.conf) to either bdb1_hash or dbm_hash.

  This problem was fixed in 5.3-RELEASE, but users of 4.10-RELEASE and
  5.2.1-RELEASE (and older releases) will find fixes by updating to the
  latest (at least after Sep 20) of RELENG_4 or RELENG_5.

20041116:
  AFFECTS: users of www/bricolage
  AUTHOR: ports@rbt.ca

  Bricolage may now be run on mod_perl compiled as a DSO for Apache
  when following these guidelines:

  http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#When_DSO_can_be_Used

  To do this, you will need to:
    pkg_delete -f apache-mod_perl
    pkg_delete -f p5-libapreq-static
    portupgrade -rR bricolage

  Bricolage will rebuild mod_perl, apache and libapreq using their standard
  versions.

20041115:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the recent removal of INDEX and INDEX-5 from FreeBSD's CVS,
  portupgrade with default configuration will run 'make index' if started
  after cvsup'ing the ports-collection. This may take an undesirably long
  time.

  There are several ways to work around this, for example:

  - Run 'make fetchindex' after cvsup'ing ports.

  or

  - Adjust the PORTS_INDEX variable in your environment or in
    pkgtools.conf (see portupgrade(1) or the default pkgtools.conf) to
    a different value than the default.

  Also remember that 'make index' is only supported on _complete_
  ports-trees. If you are currently refusing whole categories by means
  of a cvsup refuse file, use 'make fetchindex' instead (or consider
  keeping an extra machine/jail with a complete ports-tree around to
  do INDEX builds on).

20041111:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/faad, multimedia/mpeg4ip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  mpeg4ip has been updated and broken down into 2 separate ports:
  mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2. Furthermore, mpeg4ip now depends
  on faad. Moreover, faad now depends on mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 rather
  than on mpeg4ip which avoids a cyclic dependency (mpeg4ip depends
  on faad which depends on mpeg4ip).

  If any of the old ports are installed, mpeg4ip will not compile.
  Therefore,

  1) Remove old faad and mpeg4ip ports which conflict with new
  mpeg4ip

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/mpeg4ip*
  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/faad*

  2) Install faad, mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 in the following
  order

  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/audio/faad && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip && make install clean

20041111:
  AFFECTS: users of java
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  javavmwrapper has been rewritten.  It now creates symbolic links for
  all executables of the Java VMs that have been registered with it.
  These symbolic links may impact which version of Java you are using,
  depending on your PATH, which may need to be adjusted.

  For example, if your path is:

	${LOCALBASE}/bin:${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin

  then previously "java" would resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java.
  With the new javavmwrapper it will resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.
  Depending upon the Java VMs that are registered and various environment
  variables, it may or may not be ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java that is
  run by javavmwrapper via the symbolic link ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.

  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Netatalk has been upgraded to 2.0.0.  There are some important
  instructions for upgrading from 1.6.x.  Please see
  http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html on how
  to make the transition.

20041011:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linuxpluginwrapper who are running FreeBSD
	   5.3-BETA7 or later (including -current)
  AUTHOR: nork@freebsd.org

  According to UPDATING(20041001), /etc/libmap.conf should be fixed
  libm.so.2 to libm.so.3.

20041001:
  AFFECTS: users of ports that require several base system libraries who
	   are running FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or later (including -current)
  AUTHOR: kensmith@freebsd.org

  As part of the FreeBSD-5.3 release the following system libraries
  had their version number incremented:

	/lib/libm.so.2 -> libm.so.3
	/lib/libreadline.so.4 -> libreadline.so.5
	/usr/lib/libhistory.so.4 -> libhistory.so.5
	/usr/lib/libopie.so.2 -> libopie.so.3
	/usr/lib/libpcap.so.2 -> libpcap.so.3

  This should have no effect unless you are using FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or
  higher, or if you are a -current user who upgraded after this date.
  Assuming you did a from-source upgrade new versions of these libraries
  will be created but the old versions will be left behind (for example
  /lib/libm.so.2 will be the old one, /lib/libm.so.3 will be the new one).
  Any ports or pre-built packages you have currently installed will
  continue to use the old library, any ports you install after the upgrade
  will begin to use the new library.  You will need to have all your
  ports recompiled before the old library goes away.  To help with the
  migration you could also use /etc/libmap.conf to map libm.so.2 to
  libm.so.3.

20040903:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kdenetwork3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  The lanbrowsing facility of KDE has been removed from the main
  kdenetwork3 port and is now available via the net/lanbrowsing
  port.

20040901:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  www/squid now installs an rcNG script by default. This means you
  need to explicitly enable squid by setting squid_enable=yes in
  /etc/rc.conf.
  The squid.sh script uses the following variables:
  squid_chdir
  squid_flags
  squid_user

  Please see the squid.sh script for further details.
  If you want to install an old style rc-script, build the port with
  "WITHOUT_SQUID_RCNG=YES" or by rerunning "make config" and disabling this
  option.

20040830:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  In KDE 3.3, a number of files were moved between ports and some ports
  were removed. This means that you will have to take some precautions
  to update your KDE installation. A simple portupgrade -a will not work.
  portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behaviour and crashes from applications launched during the update.

  1.) First, make sure your ports index is up to date.

      	cd /usr/ports && make index

      or, if you're using the sysutils/portindex port

      	portindex

  2.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeaddons-kontact-plugins-\* \
      	kdeaddons-kaddressbook-plugins-\* kdepim-\* kdeutils-\* \
      	kdeaddons-\[0-9\]\* kde-\[0-9\]\*

      kdegraphics now conflicts with the kolourpaint package and kdeedu now
      conflicts with the kwordquiz package. If you have kwordquiz and/or
      kolourpaint installed on your system and you want to use the kdegraphics/
      kdeedu ports, you should first deinstall the conflicting packages:

      	pkg_deinstall -f kolourpaint\* kwordquiz\*


  3.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade arts\* kde\* quanta\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

      Note that the quanta port has been renamed to kdewebdev. The commands
      above will automatically replace quanta with kdewebdev, if you have
      quanta installed.

  4.) Reinstall any KDE ports you deleted in step 2. Note that the kdeaddons-
      kontact-plugins (net/kontact-plugins), kdepim-kpilot (palm/kpilot) and
      quanta (www/quanta) ports/packages do not exist anymore and cannot be
      reinstalled.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again.

  - KMail has been heavily modified since KDE 3.2.x. Testing shows that KMail
    can display erratic behaviour and crashes after the update. If you see any
    such behaviour, it is recommended to simply close KMail and start it again
    until it resumes normal operation.

    The integration of GnuPG and KMail for signing, encrypting and verifying
    PGP/MIME mail has also changed. A quick howto is available at
    http://freebsd.kde.org/howtos/gnupg-kmail.php.

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdmrc (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration.

  - Extensive information about changes from KDE 3.2.x can be found at
    http://www.kde.org/announcements/changelogs/changelog3_2_3to3_3.php

20040829:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt-devel
  AUTHOR: udo.schweigert@siemens.com

  The defaults of the port have been changed from WITH_MUTT_NCURSES to
  WITH_MUTT_SLANG to be in sync with the mail/mutt port. If you really have
  problems with slang (which should be a very rare case) be sure to have set
  COLORTERM=yes and COLORFGBG="color1;color2" in your environment, or recompile
  the port with the WITH_MUTT_NCURSES knob set (e.g. by adding
  WITH_MUTT_NCURSES=yes to your /etc/make.conf).

20040828:
  AFFECTS: users of security/samba-vscan
  AUTHOR: jmelo@freebsdbrasil.com.br

  The default location of the configuration files has been changed
  from /etc/ to /usr/local/etc and from /etc/samba/ to
  /usr/local/etc/samba-vscan/; the default location of the data files
  has been changed from /var/run/clamd to /var/run/clamav/clamd and
  from /var/opt/f-secure/fsav/databases to /var/db/fsav/databases.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ptex-tetex, japanese/xdvik, and japanese/dvipsk
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/ptex-tetex, japanese/xdvik, and japanese/dvipsk now
  look for the texmf.cnf file in $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf first,
  while some utilities included in the original teTeX distribution
  such as kpsepath(1) look for the file in $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf
  first.  This is for separating the pTeX's texmf.cnf and
  the original TeX's texmf.cnf, and you do not have to copy or
  link the file $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf to $TEXMF/web2c/.
  To lookup pTeX path by using kpsepath(1) and so on, please
  set TEXMFCNF environment variable as described in
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf.  For more detail, see
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf and $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/platex209-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/platex209-* are renamed to japanese/platex209 and
  now depend on japanese/ptex-tetex.  While EUC-JP and JIS
  encoding can be used by default, but Shift JIS is no longer
  supported because it makes very difficult to maintain other
  pTeX related ports.  However, "ptex --kanji=sjis" still works,
  so it can be used if all of macro files under share/texmf are
  converted to Shift JIS encoding manually.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/dvipsk-vflib
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/dvipsk-vflib has been removed because it is not maintained
  for a long time.  While japanese/dvipsk itself has no support to
  rendering vector fonts, this and Ghostscript give almost the same
  functionality.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/xdvik-vflib
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/xdvik-vflib has been renamed to japanese/xdvik because
  it has nothing to do with VFLib now.  It depends on and uses
  FreeType2 to render vector fonts.

20040817:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache2
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  Summary of recent changes:
  - Access to filesystem is denied by default.
  - mod_proxy* are no longer built by default
  - Now ${PREFIX}/etc/apache2/Includes/*.conf can be used to store
    local configuration or sample configurations.
  - Makefile.modules.3rd contains modules selection for apache 2.x and 1.3.x

20040815:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap22{,-sasl}-server
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  The start/stop script has moved to ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d. Users on 5.x
  who want to start the daemon early can set WITH_RCORDER=yes.

  Setting WITH_ODBC_TYPE is not sufficient to enable SQL backend
  support, WITH_ODBC=yes is required.

  please do the following:

  1.) Copy /usr/local/share/config/kdm/kdmrc away to a safe place, for example
  your home directory ( cp /usr/local/share/config/kdm/kdmrc ~/ )

  2.) Run, as root: genkdmconf --no-old

  3.) Put your copy of kdmrc back to /usr/local/share/config/kdm/kdmrc (cp
  ~/kdmrc /usr/local/share/config/kdm/ )

  Optional step 4.) Run, as root: genkdmconf (without any options) to update
  your kdmrc to the lastest configfile format

  Note for advanced users: Substitute /usr/local with your custom PREFIX if
  you're using one.

20040730:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org, mat@FreeBSD.org, marcus@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.5. you should update everything
  depending on perl, that is:
    * first, upgrade your perl5.8 installation.
    * run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you have 5.8.5.
    * now, run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5.8.5 |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.[124] -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards.
      Please note, that this last step is, strictly speaking, not necessary,
      if you are upgrading from 5.8.4.  But it is cleaner to do so anyway.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/apache-ant
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to Ant 1.6.2 introduces the following changes which may break
  older environments, according to the 1.6.2 release notes:

  . The import task used the canonical version of a file path. This
    has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 28505.
  . ant-xalan2.jar has been removed since the only class contained
    in it didn't depend on Xalan-J 2 at all. Its sole dependency has
    always been TraX and so it has been merged into ant-trax.jar.
  . All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a buildexception
    giving the location in the buildfile of the task.
  . Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to
    the Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.
  . <junitreport> will very likely no longer work with Xalan-J 1.

20040724:
  AFFECTS: users for xorg and GNOME
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  After migrating from XFree86 to X.Org, you must rebuild
  x11-toolkits/libwnck and x11/libxklavier for full GNOME functionality
  to be restored.

  If you receive an XKB initialization error when starting GNOME, edit
  your XF86Config or xorg.conf, and remove the line:

Option "XkbRules" "xfree86"

20040723:
  AFFECTS: users of FreeBSD-current, users of xorg
  AUTHOR: anholt@FreeBSD.org

  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is deprecated and has been replaced by the
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may be set to xorg, xfree86-4, or
  xfree86-3.  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM defaults to xorg on FreeBSD-current.  If you are
  switching to xorg, you should follow this set of commands to cleanly upgrade:

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/imake-4* /var/db/pkg/XFree86-*
  cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg && make install
  pkgdb -F

  Users of -stable or older -current can switch to X.Org by setting
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM=xorg in make.conf and following the same process.

  Alternately, FreeBSD 5.x and later users can use portupgrade with packages:
    cd /var/db/pkg
    portupgrade -o devel/imake-6  imake-4*
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-libraries  XFree86-libraries
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-clients  XFree86-clients

  AFFECTS: users of PHP
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old lang/php4 and lang/php5 ports have been splitted into 'base' PHP,
  PEAR, and shared extensions to allow more flexibility and add new features.
  Upgrading your current PHP installation will result in a 'base' PHP
  installation (no PEAR and no extensions).
  PEAR can be found in the new devel/php4-pear and devel/php5-pear ports, while
  the set of PHP extensions to install can be choosen via the meta-ports
  lang/php4-extensions and lang/php5-extensions, or installing singular
  extensions individually.
  If you have a previous php.ini configuration file, be sure to comment out
  the extension_dir parameter, since the correct path is statically compiled
  into the PHP binary.
  For an overview of the modules used with the old PHP binary, use
  the command "php -m".

20040717:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap21{,-sasl}-client
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default. To upgrade all ports do
    portupgrade -rfo net/openldap22-client openldap-client
  (or a similar command for the SASL variant). If you do not want to
  upgrade, add the line `WANT_OPENLDAP_VER?=21' to /etc/make.conf

  Note that when you want to upgrade openldap21{,sasl}-server, you have
  to use slapcat/slapadd to migrate the database, since the internal
  format is not binary compatible. Simply upgrading the server without
  doing a slapcat first can corrupt your database.

20040717:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim on FreeBSD 5.x
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  The default location of the startup script has been changed to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d. When you depend on the previous behaviour,
  build the port with WITH_RCORDER=yes.

  Setting WITH_OPENLDAP_VER and WITH_MYSQL_VER do not automatically
  imply the corresponding WITH_ varibale. The use of these options
  is discouraged, use the global settings (WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and
  DEFAULT_MYSQL_VER) to set system wide defaults.

20040709:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/milter-sender
  AUTHOR: vs@FreeBSD.org

  Milter-sender version 0.58 released.
  When updating to version 0.58, beware if you have a personalised
  configuration file (milter-sender.cf).  The meaning of the
  MxAcceptsAllAction variable has changed and its default has changed
  from 4 to 6.  If this variable is not updated, greylisting might be
  more aggressive than expected.

20040708:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Opera 7.52 released.
  The file search.ini has been changed to ensure correct default
  addresses for dictionary and encyclopedia searches.  Existing
  versions will be overwritten on upgrade.  Users who have a
  customized search.ini file that they would like to keep, should
  edit its version number to 4 before upgrading.  Note that you
  have to edit the search.ini file located in the /.opera folder.

20040703:
  AFFECTS: users of net/netatalk-devel
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Netatalk-devel has been converted to use RCng.  That means all of the
  netatalk daemons must be enabled in /etc/rc.conf before they will start
  (previously, all netatalk daemons would start by default).  The following
  variables are used by the new netatalk.sh script:

  atalkd_enable

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/xdvik-vflib*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/xdvik-vflib no longer supports VFlib2, and now depends on
  print/freetype2.  For the configuration details, see vfontmap file which
  installed as texmf/xdvi/vfontmap.  japanese/kochi-ttfonts is used for
  min and goth by default.

  xdvik-vflib-pk* variants has been removed because pkfonts are already included
  in the teTeX distribution.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX has been split into print/teTeX-base and print/teTeX-texmf,
  and print/teTeX is now a meta-port for the two and print/dvipsk-tetex and
  print/xdvik.  print/teTeX installs dvips and xdvi by default again (via
  print/dvipsk-tetex and print/xdvik).   For people who want to use teTeX,
  simply install print/teTeX with options set by default.

  print/teTeX-base has additional options for adding xdvi and dvips included
  in the teTeX distribution itself, but use of them are not recommended if
  you do not understand what you are trying to do.  Especially, when the
  options are set by yourself, do not install ports that match *xdvi* and
  *dvips* because they break the installed print/teTeX-base's dviware
  and such conflicts will not be detected.  In most cases, a combination
  of print/teTeX-base + print/dvipsk-tetex + print/xdvik (which are
  installed by print/teTeX by default) will be sufficient.

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The firefox-0.9 update has a special requirement before you can run it.
  You must first run firefox as root before running it as another user.
  The best way to do this is to su - to root or log
  in as root (i.e. do not su -m to root).  After becoming root, simply run
  ``firefox''.  You can then quit the browser, then run it as any other
  user.  If you do not run firefox as root first, the browser window will

        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.2 -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterward.

  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  In Mailman 2.1.5, some significant changes have been made to the
  file formats for qfiles and the pendings database.  See
  $PREFIX/share/doc/mailman/UPGRADING for details (if you define
  NOPORTDOCS, refer relevant file in an archive).

20040527:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap22-client
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenLDAP library soname has changed, requiring a recompilation
  of all dependent ports:

  portupgrade -rf net/openldap22-client

20040525:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-client
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  This port was removed because of dependencies problem. If you still want to
  have it, install databases/postgresql7 with -DWITHOUT_SERVER

20040521:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-hybrid-ru
  AUTHOR: krion@FreeBSD.org

  UID/GID were changed from 6667 to 555, please manually delete
  old entries from /etc/passwd /etc/master.passwd and /etc/group

  AFFECTS: users of audio/faad
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  If the compilation of faad fails, please manually delete older
  installed version of faad and reinstall from port.

20040512:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX no longer installs dvipsk by default.  To build and
  install dvipsk, you have to specify WITH_DVIPSK, or the dvipsk utility
  in the print/teTeX is also available print/dvipsk-tetex separately.
  This change is to resolve conflicts between various versions of dvips.

20040504:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/drac
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The "drac_flags" rc.conf(5) variable has been renamed to "dracd_flags".
  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache13
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The apache13 port must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040429:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/smartmontools
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The smartmontools port must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The cdrecord program now uses ${PREFIX}/etc (e.g. /usr/local/etc) instead
  of /etc/default as the location of the global configuration file. If you
  created such a configuration file you need to copy it over to the new
  location.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update KDE from version 3.2.1 or earlier to version 3.2.2 while
  running a KDE session, newly opened instances of Konqueror might hang
  or crash, depending on how far the update has progressed.

  If this happens, it is necessary to restart your KDE session in order to
  restore proper operations.

20040404:
  AFFECTS: GNOME desktop users
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.6.  Simply portupgrading will cause serious
  problems if you are using the desktop itself.  If you are a GNOME desktop
  user, you should carefully read the instructions at:

  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html

  And use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to properly upgrade to GNOME 2.6.  If
  you are just a casual user of some of the GNOME libraries, portupgrade
  should be sufficient to update your ports.

20040316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/isc-dhcp3-*
  AUTHOR: des@FreeBSD.org

  The isc-dhcp3-* ports must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message for details.

20040313:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/expat2
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Users of expat2 (and its many dependencies) should do the following to
  properly update expat2 and all of its dependencies:

  portupgrade -rf textproc/expat2

20040311:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL 7.4.2 Released and release notes available at
  http://www.postgresql.org/news/173.html

  NOTICE: unlike most minor versions, this version does require some
  updates to the pg_* system tables. Full instructions for how to do
  this are included in the full HISTORY file.

  DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3 and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update
  kdebase to version 3.2.1, then restart KDE.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/arts and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

20040305:
  AFFECTS: users of security/antivir-milter
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  When updating from a previous version of security/antivir-milter you
  have to do the following after deinstalling the old port:
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key
    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.
    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter
    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.
    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of ruby and portupgrade
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.

20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.
  AUTHOR: obrien@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of perl to 5.8.

  1) Force perl-5.6.1 to be upgraded with perl-5.8.
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
