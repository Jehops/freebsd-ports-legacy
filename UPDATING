This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of ruby and portupgrade

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.  Otherwise, please
  run the following series of commands to migrate to ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and ruby 1.8 will be installed)
        pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
        (cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 (to use ruby 1.8)
        portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks)
        portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia)
        pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16


20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.

  Change the default version of perl to 5.8.

  1) Force perl-5.6.1 to be upgraded with perl-5.8.
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
