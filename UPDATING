This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

    user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

    ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

    http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server
  and japanese/sj3-lib, respectively for more fine-grained dependency
  management in the Ports Collection.

20080926:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid30
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  The Squid developers decided to disable COSS support in 3.0, cf.
  the discussion starting here:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/200809/0067.html

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations.ignore

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install
  the crontab file, it can be installed manually from
  /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in, e.g.:

	crontab -u logcheck /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in

20080907:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mediawiki
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  www/mediawiki version is 1.13 now.  1.12 version was preserved as
  www/mediawiki12 port.

20080902:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

20080902:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  This is a major update.

  Deprecated: server-side image maps (use client-side instead); definition
  of categories within proc areadef (use proc categories instead); proc print.

  Discontinued attributes: proc processdata's stack; proc usedata's element,
  proc getdata's rotate, and proc defineunits (use the $changeunits()
  function instead).

  proc rangebar has been renamed proc boxplot and there are major
  functionality changes.  Any script that uses proc rangebar will need
  maintenance.

  See http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/news.html for more information.

20080901:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/pine4 and editors/pico
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have been removed in favor of the new mail/alpine and
  editors/pico-alpine ports.  UW discontinued work on Pine in September
  2005 and is focusing on Alpine now.  You should be able to directly
  replace pine with alpine.

  See http://www.washington.edu/alpine/ for more information.

20080831:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.4.1, and the example web server
  configuration has changed.  Please read pkg-message and check that
  your server configuration is OK.

20080827:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now
  installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", and some server
  side programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking
  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  Please see this URL for more information:
  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/RelNotes-1.6.0.txt

20080827:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmhandle
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  A qmHandle.conf file was created, for now, is not needed to edit
  ${PREFIX}/bin/qmHandle to change stopqmail and startqmail variables.
  Just remember to edit configuration file after upgrade.

20080820:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-DBI
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-DBI has been forked into a MASTER and SLAVE setup
  www/p5-Apache-DBI-mp1 and www/p5-Apache-DBI-mp2 so as to work with
  www/rt38 among possibly other ports.

20080820:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and
  queues, and all your persisted messages!

20080816:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand
  once you are done with them.  The information that was stored there will
  now come in your nightly system email.

20080815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup
  AUTHOR: vd@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0.  This is
  an incompatible upgrade.  If you need the "old" 1.0.5, you can find it
  in sysutils/rdiff-backup10.

20080813:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The layout of the ikiwiki.setup file has changed in a significant
  way in this release.  Old setup files will continue to work, but new
  features, like the new websetup interface, require a new format
  setup file.  You can convert old setup files into the new format by
  running the following command for all your ikiwiki.setup files:

	ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamdyke
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The spamdyke port has been updated to 4.0.2.  The new version is not
  backwards compatible with previous versions.  Please examine the new
  configuration file for the changes.

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pgbouncer
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with port version 1.2.3, pgbouncer does not run as root anymore.
  If you are upgrading from earlier versions, please update your configuration
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/pgbouncer.ini to use log and pid file paths owned by the
  newly created pgbouncer user (or customize for a different user yourself).

  Default logfile: /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log
  Default pidfile: /var/run/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.pid

20080808
  AFFECTS: users of chinese/phpbb-tw
  AUTHOR: chinsan@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for phpbb-tw has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/phpBB2 to ${PREFIX}/www/phpBB2.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/phpBB2 /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

20080806:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 1.3x, the net-p2p/transmission now is a meta-port. It depends on
  cli, daemon, and gtk2. If you don't want that, uninstall transmission and
  install net-p2p/transmission-cli by doing:

  	portmaster -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

  	portupgrade -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

20080805:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The qt4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Git's cvsps dependency has been switched from cvsps-devel to cvsps.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following before
  upgrading git:

	portmaster -o devel/cvsps devel/cvsps-devel

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

20080727:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 3.0.1_1,1; it no longer seeks for plugins in lib/browser_plugins,
  because few plugins that built with Firefox 2 can cause Firefox 3 to crash.
  We are working on making some changes with plugins directory by using
  www/linux-mplayer-plugin/Makefile.npapi. If there are some other plugins
  that work with Firefox 3 and you would like to use, you can copy them to
  ~/.mozilla/plugins or /usr/local/lib/firefox3/plugins manually for now.

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to properly update x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info, do
  the following using portupgrade:

	# pkg_deinstall -fO nautilus
	# portupgrade shared-mime-info
	# portinstall -O nautilus

  Once misc/shared-mime-info has been updated, each user will need to run the
  following command:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ojs2
  AUTHOR: Greg Larkin <glarkin@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a prior version of ojs2, please backup
  your database, uploaded files directory, and your config.inc.php before
  the upgrade.  Read /usr/local/share/docs/ojs2/UPGRADE or visit
  http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE for additional upgrade information.

20080721:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freenet6
  AUTHOR: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@mavetju.org>

  Please note that there has been a major update of this port (from
  version 2.x to 5.x) and that the name of the binaries and configuration
  files has changed from "tpsc" to "gw6c". The configuration files
  have to be copied from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/freenet6 to
  ${PREFIX}/etc again.

20080719:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/gprename
  AUTHOR: Martin Tournoij <carpetsmoker@rwxrwxrwx.net>

  GPRename configuration files now live ~/.config/gprename instead of ~/, to
  upgrade use the following commands:

	% mkdir -p ~/.config/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename ~/.config/gprename/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename_log ~/.config/gprename/gprename_log

20080717:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/anjuta
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  This update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a
  long time and its use was not really recommended. Please consider
  moving to Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need
  ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be
  removed from the ports tree at the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade
  this port *twice* in order to get the library dependency right.

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page
  title, in its 'page' cgi parameter.  You will need to rebuild any
  existing ikiwiki installations in order to update their 'edit' links
  to the new format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend
  instead of textproc/hyperestraier. You will need to update the
  configuration of any search enabled ikiwiki installations and
  rebuild them since the search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman\*
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0.\*

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*
	# portupgrade -r poppler-0.\*

20080627:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
  AUTHOR: Jung-uk Kim <jkim@FreeBSD.org>

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

20080626:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing
  databases to a GRAMPS XML file. After the upgrade you can import
  them into the new version.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x
  will not receive any further updates; all users must update mod_security
  port to versions 2.1 or 2.5.

  You can get more information about update issues at:

	http://www.modsecurity.org/documentation/

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera and www/opera/devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; native amd64 binaries; no 4.x
  support.  You will be asked whether to convert mail and feeds to new
  format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to downgrade back to
  the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

20080622:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, subversion-devel and subversion-freebsd
	   with apr from www/apache22
  AUTHOR: Clement Laforet <clement@FreeBSD.org>

  apr and apr-util bundled with apache 2.2.9 have been upgraded to 1.3.x, so
  shared libraries' versions have been bumped. If you are using subversion
  with apache22 apr, you must rebuild subversion after the update.

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as
  to not conflict with editors/2bsd-vi.  Please note the new names if
  you use this port.

20080616:

  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will
  have to edit your config file when updating to 1.1.0-dev-r1373 version of
  the port.  Please see the following URL for more information:

  paman was renamed to pavucontrol, which are two different projects.
  paman is a GTK frontend to PulseAudio, while pavucontrol is a GTK-based
  volume control tool to PulseAudio.

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext\*

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of emacs lisp
  directories had changed. So you should reinstall all ports depending on
  this one. Run something like:

	# portupgrade -fr emacs

20080601:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  If password based logins is enabled in ikiwiki, those passwords were
  stored in cleartext in the userdb.  To guard against exposing users'
  passwords, ikiwiki 2.48 and later use strong (blowfish) hashes for
  storing passwords.

  To hash existing passwords, update to ikiwiki-2.48 and run the
  following command for each of your ikiwiki src dirs:

	ikiwiki-transition hashpassword /path/to/your/wiki/srcdir

  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: scheidell@secnap.net

  Amavisd-new 2.6.0 introduces several incompatibilities with prior versions.
  If you are upgrading from 2.5.4 or earlier, you will need to update your
  SQL schema.  If you have third party programs that access SQL tables, you
  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  Full information in /usr/local/share/doc/amavisd-new/RELEASE_NOTES.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser. Unfortunately the new parser

  ${WWWDIR}/bin/migrate_config.inc from the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to pg_top. To avoid
  conflict with another port in the tree with the same name we have retained
  'ptop' as the portname. Also note, the binary has also changed to pg_top.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from

  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active

20080216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

20080203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its

20080118:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user

  From version 0.8.7a database settings has moved to config.php file.
  You have to copy your settings from db-settings.php to config.php and
  remove db-settings.php file after updating.

  Plugin support is dropped again and will not be revived anymore in the
  port.  A reason for that is the patch is unofficial and there are long
  time lags between a new cacti version released and time when the patch
  is adapted.

20071215:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: koitsu@FreeBSD.org

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.6.2.  This update requires
  modifications to your Apache httpd.conf, as the new version of suPHP does
  things differently than the previous version -- particularly in regards
  to how AddHandler is used.

  Previously, enabling suPHP was as simple as:

	suPHP_Engine on
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	AddHandler x-httpd-php .php

  With suPHP 0.6.2, these should be changed to:

	suPHP_Engine on
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	suPHP_AddHandler application/x-httpd-php

  If you forget this change, your PHP content will likely be offered as
  downloadable content and not parsed by the PHP interpreter!

  Additionally, the new version uses a configuration file vs. compile-time
  settings.  The configuration file is /usr/local/etc/suphp.conf, and a
  working example installed as /usr/local/etc/suphp.conf-example.  It's
  important that the MIME type under the [handlers] section matches what
  the type passed to suPHP_AddHandler in your Apache configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  There appears to be a conflict with xorg-server 1.4 and previous version
  of nvidia-driver: new xorg-server had plist change that made upgrading of
  nvidia-driver bomb out with the following error:

	===>  Checking if x11/nvidia-driver already installed
	mv: rename /usr/local/lib/xorg/modules/libwfb.so to
	/usr/local/lib/xorg/modules/XXX-libwfb.so.%%.xorg-server-1.4_2,1:
	No such file or directory
	*** Error code 1

  To remedy the situation, deinstall any instance of nvidia-driver you might
  have, then reinstall xorg-server, e.g.:

	# cd /usr/ports/x11-servers/xorg-server
	# make install -DFORCE_PKG_REGISTER

  After that, new nvidia-driver will install cleanly.

  AFFECTS: users of net/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The skype-devel port has been upgraded to version 1.4.0.118. This requires
  a sysctl change to run. After upgrading, please do:

	sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.4.20

  from a terminal. You can also add "compat.linux.osrelease=2.4.20" to your
  /etc/sysctl.conf to make this change permanent (at boot time).

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/daemontools
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  If you were experiencing build problems on NFS when running daemontools's
  run-time testsuite, turn off the new TESTS option in the configure screen.
  On a related note, svscan can now send its error messages to multilog
  instead of readproctitle; see the etc/rc.d/svscan.sh startup script for
  more information on the svscan_* configurable variables.

20071029:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In the 4.21 update there are two major user-visible changes:
  - the stunnel binary is in ${PREFIX}/bin/, no longer in ${PREFIX}/sbin/;
  - the libstunnel library is in ${PREFIX}/lib/stunnel/ instead of lib/.

  You may need to adjust your PATH settings or your scripts to accommodate
  to the new location of the stunnel executable (and library, if there is
  actually anything using it).

20071024:
  AFFECTS: all GNOME users and ports depend on misc/gnomehier
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.20.1. All ports that depend on gnomehier have
  had their DATADIR moved from share/gnome/ to share/ (e.g.
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/gnome/ to ${LOCALBASE}/share/).
  This puts the FreeBSD GNOME ports more in line with the default GNOME
  installation hierarchy. To find the specific directories that have
  changed, see misc/gnomehier/files/dirlist. To upgrade your installed
  ports, you will need to use either sysutils/portupgrade or
  sysutils/portmaster.

    Portupgrade users:
	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade -f -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
	# portupgrade -a

    Portmaster users:
	# portmaster -o textproc/rarian textproc/scrollkeeper
	# portmaster -a

  If some of icons, applets, themes or other customized items have
  disappeared from your desktop in this upgrade, you will need to remove and
  re-add these items to make them appear again due to the DATADIR change.

20071024:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  databases/mysql-connector-java version is 5.1.5 now. 5.0.8 version was
  preserved as databases/mysql-connector-java50 port.

20071009:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/vpopmail
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  The vpopmail port has been upgraded to version 5.4.20.  There are several
  important changes that may affect your vpopmail installation and may need
  you to handle manually:

  - THE MYSQL CONNECTION INFORMATION IS NO LONGER DEFINED AT COMPILE-TIME!
    The WITH_MYSQL_{USER,PASSWD,SERVER,DB} variables should NOT be defined
    when you build the port; place that information in the vpopmail.mysql
    file after vpopmail has been installed!
  - the default domain is also no longer defined at compile time -- you need
    to place it in the defaultdomain file after the installation.
  - the defaultdomain and vpopmail.mysql files are no longer blindly removed
    on deinstallation, they are only removed if they have not been modified
  - in vpopmail 5.4.18, the database schema was changed -- some fields were
    extended from 64 to 96 characters.  If you do not apply those changes
    to your database, as explained in the vpopmail/doc/UPGRADE file, your
    vpopmail installation may silently fail or lose the trailing portions
    of domain names and usernames.
  - in vpopmail 5.4.19, the upstream authors integrated large parts of
    Alex Dupre's SpamAssassin support, without the SPAM_THRESHOLD part.
    If you use vpopmail along with the SpamAssassin FreeBSD port support,
    take extra care to ensure that your installation still processes
    e-mail messages in the same way.
  - vpopmail 5.4.19 added support for maildrop as a mail delivery agent.
    This is available in the FreeBSD port if WITH_MAILDROP is defined.
    There is also a new user-limit flag for maildrop delivery.
  - vpopmail 5.4.19 added support for MySQL connections via Unix sockets
    instead of TCP sockets to the server.  To do that, change the second
    value (the port number) in vpopmail.mysql to the full pathname of
    the MySQL socket (e.g. /tmp/mysql.sock).
  - vpopmail 5.4.20 extended the LDAP support; please see README.ldap for
    more information, and specify the LDAP connection information in
    the vpopmail/etc/vpopmail.ldap file after the installation.

20071008:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mediawiki
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  www/mediawiki version is 1.11 now. 1.10 version was preserved as
  www/mediawiki110 port.

20071008:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/OpenEXR and graphics/ilmbase
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The new OpenEXR (1.6 and later) separated two libraries. The first is IlmImf
  library a.k.a. ILM's "EXR" file format operation library for storing 16-bit
  FP images. The others are Half, IlmThread, Imath and Iex a.k.a. ILM's basic
  utility libraries.

  To portupgrade OpenEXR and related ports, please do following operations,
  manually:

  # pkg_delete -f OpenEXR
  # pkg_delete -f ilmbase	(if you already installed before CONFLICT)
  # cd /usr/ports/graphics/OpenEXR
  # make install
  # pkgdb -F

  AFFECTS: everyone
  AUTHOR: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org>

  The ports tree has been migrated to the latest version of autoconf,
  2.61.  Versions 2.53 and 2.59 were declared obsolete and removed.

  m4 was also updated to 1.4.10, but this proved to be incompatible and
  was rolled back to 1.4.9.  If you are experiencing 'Makefile: not found'
  errors, make sure you are not using 1.4.10.

20070928:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Lewis <moggie@elasticmind.net>

  Significant changes have been made between the 1.0.x series and the
  current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services be stopped, and the proper upgrade
  procedure be followed as described in
  '/usr/local/share/doc/ratbox-services/', before restarting ratbox-services
  with the new release version.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an upgrade, an
  incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

20070926:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-gearmand
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  The port p5-gearmand has been split up, so Gearman servers can
  be embedded into other processes. The Gearman::Server class is
  located at devel/p5-Gearman-Server, if you have devel/p5-gearmand
  installed, perform an upgrade devel/p5-Gearman-Server with a
  command like:

	# portupgrade -o devel/p5-Gearman-Server devel/p5-gearmand

20070923:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-fc7

20070919:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This is a cumulative update of net/samba3 from version 3.0.25a to
  3.0.26a. Detailed list of all the changes can be found here:

	http://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.0.26a.html

  or in the WHATSNEW.txt file in the port's document directory.

  Short summary is:

  o Memory leaks in Winbind's IDMap manager.
  o CVE-2007-4138 -- Incorrect primary group assignment for domain
    users using the RFC 2307 or sfu winbind nss info plugin.
  o File sharing with Widows 9x clients.
  o Winbind running out of file descriptors due to stalled child
    processes.
  o MS-DFS inter-operability issues.
  o Offline caching of files with Windows XP/Vista clients.
  o Improper cleanup of expired or invalid byte range locks on files.
  o Crashes is idmap_ldap and idmap_rid.

  Bug #4715 (https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4715) is NOT
  fixed yet, although it won't core dump smbd process any more. Still,
  access to the shares other than UFS is not guaranteed.

  * USE SUCH SHARES AT YOUR OWN RISK *

  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  By popular request, OPTIONS support has been added. When enabled
  (default), these knobs are ignored:

	WITH_<CATEGORY>_MODULES
	WITHOUT_<CATEGORY>_MODULES
	WITH_CUSTOM_<CATEGORY>
	WITH_MODULES
	WITHOUT_MODULES
	WITH_STATIC_MODULES

  However, you can disable OPTIONS by defining WITHOUT_APACHE_OPTIONS.

20070913:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  X.org ports were updated to 7.3.  Since we're now using the modular
  build, the upgrade is pretty much painless.  If you're using the
  x11/xorg meta-port, upgrade should be as easy as:

	# portupgrade -R xorg

  Users of nvidia-driver will have to make sure Composite extension is
  turned off and start Xorg with the following command:

	$ startx -- -ignoreABI

  The -ignoreABI option is a Xorg option. If you're using gdm, kdm or
  xdm, you will have to modify your configuration file so that Xorg
  starts with this option.

  An updated nvidia-driver should be released soon.

20070905:
  AFFECTS: testers of net/openldap24-server
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  openldap24-server was updated to 2.4.5-beta.  This is the first beta
  release of the OpenLDAP 2.4.x series, and contains significant changes
  compared to its previous release.

  Berkeley DB 4.2 support was dropped and Berkeley DB 4.6 is now default.
  As this is still a beta release, it should be treated accordingly and
  should not be used in critical (e.g. production) environments.

20070904:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail-scanner
  AUTHOR: lippe@freebsdbrasil.com.br

  qmail-scanner was updated to 2.x, and 1.x version was repocopied to
  mail/qmail-scanner1. There are some differences between these 2 versions:

  quarantine-attachments.txt has been renamed to quarantine-events.txt, it is
  used to quarantine more than just attachments, and the format of that file
  has been changed.

  Quarantine directory is now separated into THREE subdirs: "spam", "viruses"
  and "policy". This is so sites can arrange different auto-delete jobs to
  control the size of these areas if they so wish.

  Some features that were hard-wired into the main body of Q-S have been moved
  into quarantine-events.txt where they should have been all along. This makes
  it possible to change settings without reconfiguring the main body of qmail-
  scanner-queue.pl. You will need to rewrite any rules you had in place within
  the old quarantine-attachments.txt into the new format quarantine-events.txt

  Changed setuid to 6755 -- i.e. it's now setuid and setgid. Forcing all files
  to be group qscand will allow those who wish to do so to keep their AV
  daemons running as other accounts. They just need to ensure those daemons are
  members of the qscand group -- and as such should be able to read the
  necessary files. E.g. clamd could run as "clamav", but as long as account
  "clamav" is a member of group "qscand", clamd is able to read the mail enough
  to scan it.

20070903:
  AFFECTS: users of net/whois, net/gwhois
  AUTHOR: nivo+kw+ports.bfa274@is-root.com

  To avoid a conflicting binary name issue, net/whois has renamed its
  files to mwhois.  Please use mwhois if you want to use Marco d'Itri's
  whois client from now on.

20070828:
  AFFECTS: users of www/wordpress-mu
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  WORDPRESSMU (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/wordpress-mu) is deprecated,
  use WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/wordpress-mu).

20070828:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql51-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  Since libmysqlclient version number is increased, all ports depending
  on it must be recompiled. Run something like:

	# portmaster -r mysql-client

20070821:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/pidgin
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Because sound support was added to finch 2.1.1, the sound files used by
  pidgin have been moved from the pidgin port to the libpurple port.  This
  makes updating a bit tricky.  To properly update to pidgin 2.1.1 and retain
  sounds, you must first upgrade libpurple and pidgin as you normally would,
  then force a rebuild of libpurple.  For example, using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade net-im/libpurple net-im/pidgin
	# portupgrade -f net-im/libpurple

20070804:
  AFFECTS: users of DESTDIR
  AUTHOR: gabor@FreeBSD.org

  DESTDIR is a feature, that allows installation of ports into separate
  environments, like jails.  The previous implementation, introduced in the
  August 2006, had some problems and was very expensive to maintain.  It was
  completely rolled back, and replaced with a brand new implementation
  utilizing chroot.

  When DESTDIR is set, the system will chroot into the specified directory,
  mount devfs, null mount the ports tree, then proceed with building and
  installing.  Your kernel must support nullfs (is available as loadable kernel
  module on default installation).  The target environment must be a full
  FreeBSD installation. For advanced use, read comments at the beginning of
  bsd.destdir.mk.

20070730:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python24 and py-*
  AUTHOR: python@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.4.x to 2.5.x.
  If you have 2.4.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python24 to
  lang/python25 with a command like:

	# portupgrade -o lang/python25 lang/python24

  If you want to keep 2.4.x installed alongside 2.5.x, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' without quotes in make.conf,
  then go to lang/python and execute

	# portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.5, by using one of the
  methods above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new Python
  version.

	# cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  This Makefile target requires ports-mgmt/portupgrade to be installed.

20070727:
  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  Extensive reworking of the autotools ports has occurred, putting them in
  the canonical locations, along with a suitable wrapper port to make
  developing autotools-using code (as opposed to just building ports)
  considerably easier.

  Upgrade path is as follows for portupgrade, substitute the appropriate
  commands if you are using portmaster:

    1. portupgrade -f 'autoconf*' 'automake*'
    2. cd /usr/ports/devel/autotools; make install
    3. portupgrade -a

  The second step is optional, but is recommended to bring in all versions
  of autoconf and automake.

20070723:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver and slave ports
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  NVVERSION is no longer user settable variable, it's derived from
  DISTVERSION from now on.  If you used nvidia-driver port with custom
  NVVERSION, it's time to switch to corresponding legacy driver version
  port.  They were renamed in order to stop hardcoding explicit version
  numbers in their [directory] names.

20070718:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/llvm
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: nobutaka@FreeBSD.org

  editors/emacs port is upgraded to 22.1.
  Since this is a major upgrade, all installed elisp ports should be
  reinstalled.

  Please add EMACS_PORT_NAME=emacs22 to /etc/make.conf and upgrade Emacs
  and related ports with:

	# portupgrade -fr emacs

  If you want to keep using Emacs 21.3, please add EMACS_PORT_NAME=emacs21
  to /etc/make.conf and reinstall Emacs from editors/emacs21 port:

	# portupgrade -f -o editors/emacs21 emacs

20070713:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/pulseaudio
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The realtime group (default GID of 557) has been renamed pulse-rt to keep
  in sync with the pulseaudio distribution.  If you are upgrading from a
  previous version of pulseaudio, you will need to modify /etc/group and
  change the name of the group with ID 557 to ``pulse-rt''.

  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd-devel and web apps porters
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd-devel now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root
  directory for its data files. The xshttpd configuration files have
  been moved to ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/. Move the appropriate
  local files manually if you are upgrading from versions <= 3.5.b07

  # portupgrade -o security/sshguard-pf sshguard\*

20070526:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/perforce
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Perforce has been updated to version 2006.2. Even though upgrading
  should be fairly straightforward, it is still highly recommended
  to follow the upgrading instructions in the release notes:

20070525:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/senna and textproc/p5-Senna
  AUTHOR: kuriyama@FreeBSD.org

  Index format (binary) and some of APIs are changed.  At least you
  need to rebuild all indexes, and maybe need to change your code (if
  you use senna API) to follow up to new API.

20070514:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3, japanese/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@gnu.org

  ATTENTION! Besides security fixes this version of Samba3
  significantly changes a lot of options and behavior of Samba.
  Please, read WHATSNEW.txt and other port documentation before
  upgrading production systems.

  Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
  ===================================

  Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
  improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating
  domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
  information.


  New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
  ================================

  The 3.0.25 release of Samba includes a rewritten IdMap interface
  for winbindd which replaces the "idmap backend" parameter.  Please
  refer to the "idmap domains" description in the smb.conf(5) man
  page for more details.

  Dynamic DNS Updates
  ===================

  The "net ads join" command is now able to register the host's DNS
  A records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This feature
  must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate when
  running the ./configure script.  There is also a related "net ads
  dns" command for refreshing a host's records which could be launched
  from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.

  Support for Additional ACL Modules
  ==================================

  Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer
  which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL
  implementations on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.

  VFS ReadAhead Plugin
  ====================

  Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved
  performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
  allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers for
  caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
  Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between
  Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
  module by adding the following lines to the share definition in
  smb.conf:

  [file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

  Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
  due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
  Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.

  Windows Vista, Office 2007, and Offline Files
  =============================================

  Research surrounding offline files, Windows Vista, and Microsoft
  Office 2007 has revealed a incompatibility between these
  applications and the "map acl inherit = no" setting in smb.conf.
  Users requiring support client side caching (csc) and offline
  files are encouraged to enable the "map acl inherit" for any
  affected share definitions in the server's configuration.
  Future versions of Samba will enable this setting by default.

  Please refer to the smb.conf(5) man page for more details on
  "map acl inherit".

20070519:
  AFFECTS: users of Xorg
  AUTHOR: kris@FreeBSD.org

  Welcome, fearless user!  You are about to embark upon a mystical
  journey to the world of xorg 7.2.

  This upgrade procedure is for users of portupgrade.  Users of other
  upgrade tools should contact the author for the corresponding upgrade
  method for that tool.

  It is recommended that you run the xorg 7.2 upgrade inside a script(1)
  session.  This way, if something goes wrong, you will have hopefully
  saved enough information for the developers to debug the problem.
  Make sure you choose a filesystem with lots of space for the script
  output.

	# script xorg-upgrade

  You may wish to set BATCH=yes in the environment to avoid interactive
  dialogue boxes.

  You may want to consider using portupgrade-devel, which fixes some
  annoying bugs that cause upgrades to incorrectly be marked as failed
  when they actually completed successfully.  To switch to
  portupgrade-devel:

	# portupgrade -f -o ports-mgmt/portupgrade-devel portupgrade
	# rm -f /usr/ports/INDEX*.db /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db
	# pkgdb -fu

  If you have changed your ports environment in /etc/make.conf,
  /usr/local/etc/pkgtools.conf or similar you need to rebuild INDEX:

	# cd /usr/ports && make index

  If you have not changed your ports environment you can save some
  time and just fetch the latest INDEX:

	# cd /usr/ports && make fetchindex

  It is necessary to set the XORG_UPGRADE environment variable while
  updating from xorg 6.9 to 7.2.  Once the upgrade is complete this
  is no longer be required.

  For users of csh-like shells:
  # setenv XORG_UPGRADE yes

  For users of sh-like shells:
  # export XORG_UPGRADE=yes

  Unfortunately portupgrade (nor portupgrade-devel) cannot yet handle
  the rigors of the xorg upgrade without a small bit of help:

	# portupgrade -Rf libXft

  If your machine does NOT have any gstreamer ports installed, you can then
  run:

	# portupgrade -a

  However, if you DO have gstreamer ports installed, you must run:

	# portupgrade -a -x 'gstreamer*'

  Followed by:

	# portupgrade -Rr 'gstreamer*'

  When packages are available (wait for the announcement on ports@), you
  may prefer to use precompiled packages to speed up the process:

	# portupgrade -aP

  Once the upgrade completes successfully, you can delete the
  xorg-manpages package, which is now orphaned.

	# pkg_delete xorg-manpages\*

  The final step is to merge remaining files from /usr/X11R6 into
  /usr/local (/usr/X11R6 is no longer used with xorg 7.2) and replace
  /usr/X11R6 with a symlink.

  A script is provided for your convenience (or you may choose to do
  this by hand): it will first attempt to back up your /usr/X11R6 into
  /usr/tmp/mergebase in case something goes wrong, then look for
  conflicts (files in /usr/X11R6 that would overwrite files in
  /usr/local).  Depending on your system configuration you may have to
  resolve some of these conflicts by hand first (if in doubt, ask for
  help on freebsd-x11@FreeBSD.org).  You may also need to edit the
  script if the default locations are not correct on your system.

  If your /usr/X11R6 is a file system, you will also need to modify the
  script to pause after /usr/X11R6 is backed up, but before the symlink is
  created.

  # sh /usr/ports/Tools/scripts/mergebase.sh

  When the merge operation completes successfully, the /usr/X11R6
  directory hierarchy will be removed and replaced by a symlink to
  /usr/local.  This symlink is necessary because some binary ports (and
  some remaining source ports) have hard-coded references to /usr/X11R6.

  Congratulations, you are done!

  # exit

  CAVEATS

  Make sure you have the x11/xorg meta-port installed.  If you do not have
  this meta-port installed with X.Org 6.9, you will miss out on a lot of
  the new X.Org 7.2 sub-ports.

  If you plan on keeping your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf, make sure you
  change ModulePath to /usr/local/lib/xorg/modules prior to running X.

  If you run into problems running the new X server, try moving aside
  your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and allow X to run with default values. After
  that you can see the default values in a log file (e.g. /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
  and fix your xorg.conf according to the defaults.

  IF YOU RUN INTO PROBLEMS:

  # uname -a
  # ls -l /var/db/pkg
  # exit

  and send an email to freebsd-x11@FreeBSD.org with a full description
  of the problem.  Do not include the above typescript in your email,
  but bzip2 it and make it available to the developers (e.g. put it
  online or send it by private email upon request).

  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript-gnu-{commfont,jpnfont,korfont}
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  These ports now use PostScript virtual fonts to handle CJK CID/TT-CID
  emulated fonts.  CIDFnmap still works but note that if a font is both
  in Resource/Font or Resource/CIDFont and in CIDFnmap, the entry in
  Resource/* will be used.  For the actual font mapping, see files in
  Resource/CIDFont/*.  This is just an internal structural change;
  default font mapping has not been changed.

  If you use CIDFnmap to change a font mapping already defined by
  Resource/CIDFont/foo, you have to remove (or rename) the
  Resource/CIDFont/foo file first.

20070327:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-fc6
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! The port is experimental for now. Use it at your own risk. This
  port may be used only with 7-CURRENT and compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16.

  To use/test the port (along with linux FC4 infrastructure ports) you
  should do:

  0. Backup all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port.
  2. Add to your /etc/make.conf "OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6".
  3. Make sure no linux application is running.
  4. Set appropriate sysctl (compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16).
  5. Install emulation/linux_base-fc6.
  5a. Those who use linux ports with automatic plist building should
      apply the following patch:
      ftp://mail.ipt.ru/pub/FreeBSD/patches/bsd.linux-rpm.mk-autoplist.diff

  That should be enough at most circumstances. If you have difficulties,
  please be sure to expand item 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports that depend on linux base port.
  1b. Remove linux base port.
  1c. Clean /compat/linux/ directory.

  In case you want to get rid of the port, deinstall it, then return
  back compat.linux.osrelease to 2.4.2 (as usual, make sure that no
  linux application is running) and remove from /etc/make.conf the line
  containing the OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT variable.

  The lang/tcl-tk-wrapper port has been replaced by lang/tcl-wrapper and
  x11-toolkits/tk-wrapper ports. The Tcl and Tk ports no longer include an
  option to install the wrapper -- the wrapper ports require a Tcl/Tk
  instead.  The new configuration files in local etc directory are named:
  tclsh.conf, wish.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of www/drupal and drupal-*
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  All 4.x drupal ports are renamed to have a drupal4 prefix. As a result,

20070319:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/fluxbox and x11-wm/fluxbox-devel
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The x11-wm/fluxbox-devel has been merged into x11-wm/fluxbox. You should
  back up your ~/.fluxbox and remove it. If you still want to keep using
  your good old ~/.fluxbox, you will have to do the following:

    - Since prefix has been changed from X11BASE (/usr/X11R6) to
      LOCALBASE (/usr/local), you might have to edit a few paths in
      the ~/.fluxbox/* if there are any.
    - The bsetroot has been renamed to fbsetroot. You might have to
      tweak a few themes for bsetroot -> fbsetroot. Other way it can be
      is to install the x11-wm/boxtools that has bsetroot if you do not
      want to edit any themes.

  While I am here, don't forget to use 'pkgdb -Ff'. As for the portmaster
  users, I don't think you will need to do anything since portmaster will
  take care of it by default.

20070318:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.16.1, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext (read: most of them, sorry):

	portupgrade -rf gettext
  or:
	portmaster -r gettext

  In addition, if you have multimedia/vlc installed, you should deinstall
  it *before* either of the above commands, and reinstall it manually
  afterwards: vlc erroneously installs its own version of lib/charset.alias
  which will overwrite the one supplied by devel/gettext otherwise.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The HAL option has been turned on by default and the fstabbackend
  patches which have kept the fstab backend for the media kioslave
  at the status quo of KDE 3.5.3 have been removed. This means that

     MOUNTING DEVICES THROUGH KDE WILL NO LONGER WORK WITHOUT HAL.

  Thus if you wish to use device icons or the media:/ view in konqueror,
  make sure to turn on the HAL option in the x11/kdebase3 port and also
  read /usr/ports/UPDATING entry 20061219 and
  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q19 for more information on
  using HAL.

20070312:
  AFFECTS: all users of net/py-libdnet
  AUTHOR: tmclaugh@FreeBSD.org

  The py-libdnet port has been separated out as a slave port to libdnet and
  is now dependent on libdnet.  py-libdnet now only installs the libdnet
  python modules.  Since files previously owned by py-libdnet are now owned
  by its dependency, in order to upgrade correctly, py-libdnet must be
  deinstalled and then reinstalled manually.

20070205:
  AFFECTS: all users of FreeBSD 4.X

  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  The binary used to start an enlightenment session was renamed from
  enlightenment to enlightenment_start. All users should update their
  xinitrc's or other startup files to reflect this change.

20070301:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade*
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because of a bug in previous version, it's recommended you fill ALT_PKGDEP
  section in pkgtools.conf file for portupgrade be aware of alternative
  dependencies you use, and run pkgdb -L to restore dependencies that was
  lost.

  Example of ALT_PKGDEP section:
  ALT_PKGDEP = {
    'www/apache13' => 'www/apache13-modssl',
    'print/ghostscript-afpl' => 'print/ghostscript-gnu',
  }

  Note also, portupgrade knows nothing how to handle ports with different
  suffixes (E.g. -nox11). So you should define explicitly variables
  (E.g. WITHOUT_X11=yes) for the ports in /etc/make.conf or pkgtools.conf
  (MAKE_ARGS section) files.

20070227:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/jabber*
  AUTHOR: martin@matuska.org

  With update to version 1.6.0 the name of the jabber daemon has been
  changed to bin/jabberd14 to avoid conflicts with other jabber daemons.
  The port now supports WITH_MYSQL and WITH_POSTGRESQL knobs.

  If you are using one of the following ports please recompile it due
  to changes in the library.

  net-im/jabber-conference
  net-im/jabber-jud
  net-im/jabber-yahoo

  Some configuration directives have changed, too. Please see example
  configuration files and README.jabberd14 files in the ports above.

  Portupgrade users:

  	pkgdb -Ff
  	portupgrade -rf speex\*

  Portmaster users, skip a first step if you don't have audio/speex-devel
  installed:

  	portmaster -o audio/speex speex-devel\*
  	portmaster -r speex\*

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The media kioslave now mounts cdrom/dvd volumes with local charset
  conversion (mount_cd9660 -C <charset>), which requires the cd9660_iconv

  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  nVidia continues to drop support for old ("legacy") GPUs.  To deal with
  this fact, the port now allows to specify correct NVVERSION in order to
  build driver that supports your graphics card.  Currently, supported
  "legacy" values are 7184 and 9631.  Consult nVidia's README (Appendix A)
  to find out whether you need to use legacy driver version, and exactly
  which one.  Alternatively, you can install one of the corresponding
  `x11/nvidia-driver-XXXX' slave ports, where XXXX == needed NVVERSION.

20070111:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/weechat
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  For users of any previous version, all your charset settings
  in weechat.rc will be LOST! You should save your weechat.rc
  to keep your values and set them again with new "charset" plugin.
  For ISO users: history of channels may be without accents
  (after /upgrade), this is not recoverable, but this is not a bug.
  All new messages should be ok.
  Be careful, now default encode is UTF-8 for all channels (before
  it was terminal charset). If you still want to send messages as
  ISO-8859-1, you should send either global encode or server specific
  encode to ISO-8859-1.
  For global encode: /setp charset.global.encode = "ISO-8859-1"
  For server encode: (on server buffer)  /charset encode ISO-8859-1

  The server-side utilities of postgresql (initdb, initlocation,
  ipcclean, pg_controldata, pg_ctl, pg_id and pg_resetxlog) are now
  installed by the respective postgresql*-server port (previously
  they where installed with the client). If you update the client, you
  should also update the server to make sure you are not left without
  the server-side tools. Do something like:

	portupgrade postgresql-client postgresql-server

20070105:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamprobe
  AUTHOR: stefan@FreeBSD.org

  With the update to version 1.4d, the SpamProbe port doesn't use the OPTIONS
  framework any more to allow part of the changes below. That means that options
  selected for this port won't be saved/used automatically any more and you have
  to set the appropriate variables in /etc/make.conf or on the command line to
  change the port's behaviour; the variables are documented at the top of the
  port's Makefile. Before updating, it might be a good idea to remove
  /var/db/ports/spamprobe.

  The port now has support for the PBL database backend; unless built with
  WITHOUT_PBL set, SpamProbe will use PBL as the default even if you have an
  existing BerkleyDB or hash database; in that case, use the parameter "-d" to
  specify the type of the existing database on the command line, e.g.:

	spamprobe -d bdb:$HOME/.spamprobe receive

  or:

	spamprobe -d hash:$HOME/.spamprobe receive

  Using PBL instead of BerkleyDB might be a good idea, though, as the former
  seems to perform better. You can convert your existing database to PBL using
  the following commands (assuming you didn't disable PBL support):

    cd
    mkdir spamprobe.new
    spamprobe -d bdb:.spamprobe export | spamprobe -d spamprobe.new import
    mv .spamprobe spamprobe.old
    mv spamprobe.new .spamprobe

  If atapicam is enabled in the kernel, hald will use the CAM device nodes
  instead of ATAPI device nodes to access disc devices (e.g. CD-ROMS,

  AFFECTS: users of security/gnupg
  AUTHOR: kuriyama@FreeBSD.org

  The security/gnupg port was upgraded to 2.0.1 (with security fix)
  and good-old gnupg-1.4.6 was repocopied to security/gnupg1.

  Both of security/gnupg (2.x) and security/gnupg1 (1.4.x) are
  designed not to conflict with each other.  So you can use
  security/gnupg1 for gpg(1), and use security/gnupg for gpg2(1)
  commands.

  All directly dependents are $PORTREVISION bumped, so portupgrade -R
  gnupg will works fine.  After portupgrade, you will have both of
  gnupg-2.0.1 and gnupg-1.4.6.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you choose to enable the HAL backend for the media kioslave,
  you should enable dbus, hal and policy kit during system startup.
  To do this, add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:

	dbus_enable="YES"
	polkitd_enable="YES"
	hald_enable="YES"

  Notes and known problems about mounting devices in media:/ with HAL enabled:

  - Your user must be in group operator in order to be able to mount removable
    media.

  - Removable media drives (such as CD-ROM drives) *MUST NOT* be listed in
    /etc/fstab in order to be mountable.

  - If you mount a volume by double-clicking it, it may appear empty. Refresh
    the fileview in konqueror to see the files.

  - Mounting floppies is currently not supported.

    You can still mount them in KDE if ...

    - You have an fstab entry for your floppy pointing to a mountpoint
      owned by your user (e.g. somewhere in your homedir)
    - The vfs.usermount sysctl is set to 1

     ... by creating a floppy device icon on your KDE desktop and selecting
	 the above-mentioned fstab entry in the device dropdown list on the
	 device tab.

  - Mounting volumes from fixed drives is prohibited for non-superusers
    by default.

  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Berkeley DB version has been changed from
  4.3 to 4.4, as suggested by OpenLDAP developers.

  Suggested upgrade steps:

    - Stop OpenLDAP server (i.e. ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/slapd stop)
    - Backup the OpenLDAP database (typically, /var/db/openldap-data)
      with your favorite tool
    - Do a "slapcat > backup.ldif" to dump all data
    - portupgrade net/openldap23-server
    - Remove BDB files from your /var/db/openldap-data;  you will want
      to keep DB_CONFIG as-is.

  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeBSD used to patch FreeRADIUS's rlm_mschap.c to strip all domain names
  when calculating the hash of an MS-CHAP challenge (a requirement specified
  in RFC 2759 paragraph 4 and amplified in paragraph 8.2). FreeRADIUS now
  offers its own solution to discard a domain name before hashing in the
  MS-CHAP code, which can be enabled via a configuration option. As there is
  no longer any need for the FreeBSD patch, it has been removed, leaving the
  MS-CHAP code behaving as supplied by the FreeRADIUS team.

  If the previous behaviour of the MS-CHAP code is required, add:

  with_ntdomain_hack = yes

  to the mschap { } section of your FreeRADIUS configuration. There should be
  a commented out line that can be modified around line 696 of
  ${PREFIX}/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf if your configuration is based on the
  sample FreeRADIUS configuration.

  This option is not set by default in the sample FreeRADIUS configuration.
  Only those who have clients sending a domain name as part of the user name
  when using MS-CHAP will be affected by this change; they will need to set
  this option to allow FreeRADIUS to authenticate their clients successfully.
  This may only affect those with older Windows clients, but I cannot be sure.

  Some sources suggest setting this configuration option anyway to prevent
  FreeRADIUS from breaching RFC 2759 inadvertently, leading to authentication
  failure. It is left to the user whether to set this configuration option
  anyway, or only to set it in the event of authentication failures stemming
  from MS-CHAP.

  Debug output from radiusd that reads "rlm_mschap: NT Domain delimeter found,
  should we have enabled with_ntdomain_hack?" suggests that this configuration
  option should be enabled.

  New maintainer alerted to this issue by private mail from Thomas Vogt
  <thomas@bsdunix.ch>.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/avr-gcc*
  AUTHOR: joerg@FreeBSD.org

  The old avr-gcc port has been renamed into avr-gcc-3, and continues
  support for GCC 3.x (for a while).

  The former avr-gcc-devel port has been moved into avr-gcc, so GCC
  4.x is now the default.

  There is an entry in MOVED for the latter change but not for the
  former one, as the automated tools (e.g. portupgrade) got confused
  otherwise.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc-devel, these tools should
  automatically take notice (based on the entry in MOVED), and change
  the installed package to avr-gcc.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc, and want to move on to the
  new default GCC 4.x, this should be fully automatic, as the port
  name just stays, and the version increases.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc, and want to stay at GCC 3.x
  for some reason, please manually perform a portupgrade to the new
  name:

	portupgrade -o devel/avr-gcc-3 avr-gcc

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@gnu.org

  Revision of Samba 3.0.23c port had changed location of the directory,
  where Samba stores it's smbpasswd files from $PREFIX/private to a more
  common $PREFIX/etc/samba.

  You need to move *.tdb files from an old to new location and remove old
  directory if you use tdbsam backend for Samba user authentication.

  Starting with the 3.0.23c release, the officially supported passdb
  backends (smbpasswd, tdbsam, and ldapsam) now operate identically with
  regards to the historical RID algorithm for unmapped users and groups
  (i.e. accounts not in the passdb or group mapping table). The resulting
  behavior is that all unmapped users are resolved to a SID in the
  S-1-22-1 domain and all unmapped groups resolve to a SID in the S-1-22-2
  domain. Previously, when using the smbpasswd passdb, such users and
  groups would resolve to an algorithmic SID in the machine's own domain
  (S-1-5-XX-XX-XX). However, the smbpasswd backend still utilizes the RID
  algorithm when creating new user accounts or allocating a RID for a new
  group mapping entry.

  With the changes in the 3.0.23c release, it is now possible to resolve
  a uid/gid, name, or SID in any direction and always obtain a symmetric
  mapping. This is important so that values for smb.conf parameters such
  as "valid users" resolve to the same SIDs as those included in the
  local user's initial token.

  AFFECTS: users of security/krb5
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of MIT KRB5 1.5, Kerberos no longer supports static linking nor
  do the static libraries build. The reason for this is that KRB5 1.5
  implements plugins to implement functions. GSS-API is now implemented
  as a function. As such, the MIT Kerberos team has yet to implement
  plugins using static libraries. Users requiring static libraries or
  statically linked binaries are advised not to upgrade to this release
  until MIT provides a solution for statically linked binaries.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@gnu.org

  Starting from version 3.0.23 Samba no longer supports experimental
  SQL and XML passdb backends. If you need this functionality, please
  visit http://pdbsql.sourceforge.net/ (port is coming soon).

  The default mapping entries for groups such as "Domain Admins" are
  no longer created when using an smbpasswd file or a tdbsam passdb
  backend. Use 'net groupmap add' rather than 'net groupmap modify'
  to set these entries.

  A substring matching rule has been added to the sambaSID attribute
  definition. For OpenLDAP servers, this will require the addition
  of 'index sambaSID sub' to the slapd.conf configuration file. It
  will be necessary to run slapindex after making this change. There
  has been no change to actual data storage schema.

  Some fixes for network play were done in UnrealTournament.ini
  There are two ways to fix it:
  1. The easy way is to remove the ${HOME}/.loki/ut directory, yet all
     local settings will be lost.
  2. The hard way: in ${HOME}/.loki/ut/UnrealTrounament.ini, under the
     [Core.System] section, SavePath, CachePath and multiple Paths
     variables should be replaced with the ones in (and in the same order

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because portupgrade had a problem with detecting Berkley DB version 2
  or newer, and the default database format is now set to use these
  versions, you can end up with a portupgrade that does not work with
  older databases. A quick fix is to remove the databases, type:
  'rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db /usr/ports/INDEX*.db'.
  portupgrade will recreate them automatically. It does absolutely no harm.

  If you do not want remove the databases, you should detect what database
  type do you use, and set the port options for portupgrade accordingly.
  Follow these instructions:

  - run 'pkgdb -fu' *before* upgrading and take a look on the output.
    You can see database format there as: format:XXX, where XXX is your
    current database format.
  - Go to portupgrade port directory and configure the port with
    `make config' command. If you have bdb_* format, then turn on the BDB4
    option. If you have bdb1_* format, then turn off BDB4 and turn on
    the BDB1 option. If you have dbd_hash format, then turn off all options.
  - Upgrade portupgrade.

  Note: if you change database format with changing port options,
  you should remove the ruby-bdb* port that you don't need anymore.
  Alternatively, you can hard code database format in your pkgtools.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of emulation/linux_base-*
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  We now use Fedora Core 4 as the linux base port, and the corresponding
  xorg libs for the linux X11 libs port.

  To upgrade you have to run
	portupgrade -f -o emulators/linux_base-fc4 linux_base\*
	portupgrade -f -o x11/linux-xorg-libs linux-XFree86-libs

  You need to make sure that you have not changed the sysctl
  compat.linux.osrelease. FC4 behaves differently depending on the
  content of this sysctl. Only the default value of this sysctl is
  supported. In case of problems also revert to the default of the
  compat.linux.osname if changed.

  In case "printenv | grep LD_" prints something, e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  or LD_PRELOAD, you have to make sure it is not set when starting
  linux programs, else FreeBSD libraries will be picked up and the
  programs do not start.

  After this start a linux program to test, e.g., acroread. If you get
  errors when starting linux programs about problems with libraries, and
  you made sure no LD_* variable is set as described above, you are one of
  those unlucky people where we do not have a better solution as to tell
  you to deinstall every linux port, remove /compat/linux completely to
  make sure no cruft is left and reinstall everything you need.

  STARTTLS support on smtpd and pop3d, if you want to use it, you need to
  install sysutils/ucspi-ssl-tls port that has the necessary patch applied.

  Remember to select STDERR option and rebuild security/clamav port, this is
  necessary to have the correct log on smtpd.

  After upgrade from 2.3.x you will need to set environment var SMTPAUTH to

  AUTHOR: gkovesdan@t-hosting.hu

  The Clamav project recommended that security/clamav and security/clamav-devel
  should depend on archivers/unzoo instead of zoo, and on archivers/arj instead
  of unarj. Because the clamav and clamav-devel ports are used quite often with
  amavisd-new, this port was modified to depend on the same two archiver ports
  as well. The amavisd-new port automatically recognizes arj, but not unzoo, so
  ${PREFIX}/etc/amavisd.conf should be modified. This line should be changed:

	  ['zoo',	\&do_zoo,	'zoo'],
  To this one:

  People currently using any of the above ports should finish and report
  their existing work (both for normal and enhanced) and not allow any
  new work until after their ports are updated, to minimize loss of

  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old PHP slave ports (phpN-cli, phpN-cgi and mod_phpN) were removed
  in favor of unified PHP ports that allow building any combination of
  PHP SAPIs (cli, cgi and apache module).
  The PHP CGI binary was renamed to php-cgi, so you should update
  the path in your script. To simplify the update process, *only* for
  this release a 'php' compatibility symlink to php-cgi will be created
  if you don't select the CLI SAPI.
  Before the upgrade you *should* run 'make config' in lang/php4 or
  lang/php5 to configure the SAPIs you want to install.
  As a consequence the default binary packages include the CLI and the
  FastCGI SAPIs.

  Recently, the port of Lua was updated to version 5.1. This version is
  incompatible with the version 5.0, which is used in a number of applications,
  most notable in the Kile and Kate editors (the latter being part of a base
  KDE installation).

  If you're having troubles running those, such as error dialogs saying "Check

  AUTHOR: arsptr@optusnet.com.au

  The instiki port has changed storage methods to use an SQL database.
  The README contains instructions on how to migrate existing wiki data to the
  new storage methods. The following is a copy of the relevant information,
  tailored for FreeBSD port users:

  1. cd /usr/ports/www/instiki; make extract
  2. Execute
      ruby work/instiki-0.11.0/script/import_storage \
	-t /usr/local/instiki/storage/2500 \
	-i /usr/local/instiki \
	-d sqlite \
	-o [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  3. This will produce instiki_import.sql file in the specified location.
     Open it in a text editor and inspect carefully.
  4. Upgrade your instiki port normally (e.g. portupgrade)
  5. Connect to your production database, e.g.:
       sqlite3 /usr/local/instiki/db/production.db.sqlite3
     and have it execute instiki_import.sql, e.g.:
       .read [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  6. Execute
       ruby /usr/local/instiki/script/reset_references production

20060403:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db*
  AUTHOR: swhetzel@gmail.com

  Most of the ports that depend on Berkeley DB have been updated to use
  Mk/bsd.database.mk. Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
  Berkeley DB, and SQLite in a port.

  The Berkeley DB support in Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to return the proper
  db* library name and location of the include and library directories of the
  requested version.

  To select a version of Berkeley DB, you can use either WITH_BDB_VER=<version>
  or ${UNIQUENAME}_WITH_BDB_VER=<version> (version is one of 3, 40, 41, 42, 43,
  or 44).

  When a port has USE_BDB defined as either 'USE_BDB=41+' or 'USE_BDB=yes', the
  port will use the oldest installed version of Berkeley DB. For example if
  both db41 and db43 are installed, the port would end up compiling with db41.
  If you add -DWITH_BDB_HIGHEST to your make command, the port will use highest
  db* instead. If no Berkeley DB is installed then the port will default to the
  version specified or the default Berkeley DB version (currently db41).

  NOTE: If a port was using a different variable to select Berkeley DB or a
  version, you will get an IGNORE message when you build the port. This
  message will tell you what you need to do.

  Port Maintainers please review the comments in Mk/bsd.database.mk on what
  variables are available for you use in your own ports.

  AFFECTS: users of biology/emboss and biology/embassy
  AUTHOR: fernan@iib.unsam.edu.ar

  Since EMBOSS-3.0.0 both EMBOSS and EMBASSY install by default into
  $LOCALBASE/emboss to avoid conflicts with other ports.

  Users upgrading to 3.0.0 should take this into consideration when
  planning the upgrade, because it will involve moving data not
  installed by the port (databases) and tweaking the emboss.defaults
  config file.

  If you want to install the ports into $LOCALBASE (/usr/local, the old
  behavior), you can still do so by setting PREFIX manually. But you
  will have to take care of conflicting ports yourself.

  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The genkdmconf.sh rc-script has been removed in favor of a kdm wrapper
  script, which now handles both launching kdm and automatically updating or
  generating kdm's configuration files. The actual kdm binaries have been
  renamed to 'kdm-bin', 'kdm-bin_config' and 'kdm-bin_greet' respectively.

  These changes should be mostly transparent to kdm users and require no
  changes to existing configurations or setups, however: The actual kdm process

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Unfortunately, it turns out that printing feature of Adobe
  Reader 7.0.5 does not work with FreeBSD's Linux emulation
  environment for now. Although English, French, German,
  Japanese, and Korean version of the port were updated to
  7.0.5 on 2006/02/21, these changes have been reverted consequently.

  Please update the packages installed (normal upgrading procedure
  by using portupgrade(1) and so on should work). I am sorry for the
  confusion.

  AFFECTS: net-im/jabber-pyicq and net-im/jabber-pymsn
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Port versions older than 0.7 and 0.11a respectively run as root which
  is an unneeded security risk. Newer versions run as as user jabber,
  so before starting the daemons, you should fix permissions for each
  spooldir (default: /var/spool/jabber):

	# chown -R jabber:jabber spooldir/Transport_JID

20060223:
  AFFECTS: all ports using libtool as part of the build process
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  The way in which ports that require libtool to build has been
  completely reworked to bring the ports system in line with other
  environments, such as Linux, and pkgsrc.

  devel/libtool13 no longer exists. devel/libtool15 has been modified
  to (a) install in the canonical locations and (b) remove a number
  of long-standing FreeBSD-specific patches that resulted in a very
  different libtool than is present on other systems.

  The main visible change will be that a large number of ports have
  had their plists modified (we now install libtool .la archives)
  and, as such, PORTREVISIONS have been bumped on ~2000 ports (roughly
  1/7th of the tree).

  Unfortunately, there is no simple upgrade path. Short of removing
  all packages and reinstalling from scratch, the only other viable
  alternative would be careful use of portupgrade. Given the large
  number of different ways in which libtool is used by other ports
  in the tree, this is a process that is likely to vary considerably
  from system to system, and as such, folks should be very mindful
  of running automatic updating software, such as portupgrade, making
  extensive use of the -n flag (and equivalents for other updaters)
  to see what will actually be rebuilt, before actually performing
  the upgrade.

  The good news is that the system now in place will make the handling
  of libtool-using ports considerably easier going forward.

20060221:
  AFFECTS: users of print/acroread7 and the localized versions
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  installation directory of print/acroread7 and the slave ports
  have been changed to ${PREFIX}/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/${ADOBE_LANG}.
  ${ADOBE_LANG} is one of CHS,CHT,DAN,DEU,ENU,ESP,FRA,ITA,JPN,KOR,
  NLD,NOR,PTB,SUO,SVE and represents language used in the UI (FRA means
  French version and it is installed by french/acroread, for example).
  To configure the UI language, navigate to Edit->Preferences->International->
  Application Language, set it to "Choose at application startup" and
  restart the program.

  The command filename is ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread as before (this is
  a script installed by print/acroreadwrapper now), and if multiple
  versions are installed, one of them will be selected according to
  ${ADOBE_LANG} environment variable. If ${ADOBE_LANG} is not set,
  it will be automatically set by using ${LANG}; this means when
  LANG=fr_FR.ISO8859-15, ADOBE_LANG will be FRA and the French version
  will be invoked by ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread. You can set ADOBE_LANG
  manually, too.

  Also, if you want to activate the PDF plugin, use --install-plugin
  option in ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread. For more detail, see
  print/acroreadwrapper/pkg-message.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/dcc-dccd
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The midnight dccm and dccifd system log message has been changed to disclose
  spam passed from whiteclnt-listed MX servers. MX servers should now be listed
  in /var/dcc/whiteclnt with lines like:

		mx      ip      10.2.3.4
		mx      ip      10.5.6.0/28
		mxdcc   ip      10.7.8.9

  "MX" marks the IP address of one of your mail systems that should be ignored
  in initial Received: headers and when reported by sendmail to dccm. "MXDCC"
  marks IP addresses of your mail systems that run DCC clients and that will
  have already reported mail to the DCC. Continue using "OK" whitelist entries
  for mail systems that you trust to never send or forward unsolicited bulk
  email. Allow custom DNS blacklist SMTP rejection messages. See
  -Bset:rej-msg=X in the dccifd and dccm man pages.

  The Tomcat ports listed above have been converted to use new-style
  rc scripts. In order to enable Tomcat, you must add:

	tomcat{4,41,5,55}_enable="YES"

  to your rc.conf. Select the appropriate version number for your
  installation. When shutting down, the rc scripts will kill the
  Tomcat process after a default timeout of 10 seconds. This can be
  changed by setting the tomcatXX_stop_timeout variable in rc.conf.

  Tomcat 5.5 users please note that the rc variables have changed name
  from jakarta_tomcat55_* to tomcat55_*.

  The "tomcatctl" executable is no longer installed. Please use the
  rc scripts to control tomcat instead.

20060126:
  AFFECTS: ports that use Display Postscript libraries and xorg-libraries
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Support for Display Postscript has been deprecated in X.Org 6.9 release
  and libraries and tools are no longer installed by default. If you have
  installed a port that complains about missing libdpstk or libpsres, you
  need to reinstall it so it will be build without DPS support.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail, mail/qmail-ldap, mail/qmail-mysql,
	   mail/qmail-spamcontrol, mail/qmail-tls and all dependant
	   ports.
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  If you use qmail installed on a PREFIX different of /var/qmail,
  please, set a var on /etc/make.conf named QMAIL_PREFIX with this
  value. It'll be used for many ports that depends of qmail.

  To prevent stale dependencies, when you use one of qmail slave ports,
  now you just need to set a var named QMAIL_SLAVEPORT on /etc/make.conf
  assigning to it the name of slave port you are using.

  The valid options for now are:
  * ldap
  * mysql
  * spamcontrol
  * tls

20060114:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20060111:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/lxdvdrip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  lxdvdrip has been updated to version 1.51 depending on port
  multimedia/vamps. However, multimedia/vamps needs to know beforehand
  how many bytes will be processed in order to work. Unfortunately,
  lxdvdrip cannot provide such information. Therefore, vamps and
  playcell specific tailored versions shipped within the lxdvdrip
  distribution will be used. They will be named so that lxdvdrip
  does not conflict with multimedia/vamps. This is for lxdvdrip
  version 1.51_1.

  However, users that used lxdvdrip previously to this update, are
  required to modify their configuration file in order to comply
  to the new naming scheme.

  File: ~/.lxdvdrip.conf
  From: play_cell_name=play_cell

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  All postgresql versions have been updated. These patch releases fix
  a problem with character string comparisons for locales that
  consider different character combinations as equal, such as
  Hungarian. This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on
  textual columns. Also, if plperl is used, a "REINDEX" might be
  required under certain conditions. Check the HISTORY file in the
  source for details.

20060108:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3, deskutils/superkaramba,
	   x11-themes/kde-windeco-smoothblend, irc/kvirc, editors/vimpart
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  A number of files have been moved from kdebase to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.3 and KDE 3.5.0 and some applications which used to be
  distributed separately from KDE have been included in the release.

  This means that you will have to take some precautions in order to
  update your KDE installation without interruptions.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires you
  to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using
  sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

	pkg_deinstall -f kdebase-\[0-9\]\* superkaramba-\[0-9\]\* \
	kde-windeco-smoothblend-\[0-9]\* kvirc-\[0-9\]\* \
	kdeaddons-vimpart-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

	portinstall -O kdebase

  Superkaramba is now included in misc/kdeutils3.

  The smoothblend window decoration is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.

  Vimpart is being discontinued and no longer part of KDE.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  =============

  Just like KDE 3.4, KDE 3.5 does not play nice with openssl-0.9.8. In
  particular it breaks kwallet, some of the SSL handling in konqueror and
  SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact.

  If you're using the openssl ports rather than the base-system openssl,
  make sure to use security/openssl-stable.

  You can put WITH_OPENSSL_STABLE=yes into /etc/make.conf to automatically
  make ports depend on that rather than on security/openssl.

  FreeBSD 4.x users MUST install openssl-stable even if the base openssl is
  present for SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact to work. Unfortunately, the
  kdepim3 port cannot depend on it automatically due to shortcomings/bugs in
  ports-collection's openssl infrastructure.

20060106:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kronolith <= 2.0.6 with MCAL backend
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 2.1, the support of MCAL will be removed
  from Kronolith. To prepare your migration, you can already switch
  to a SQL back-end, with the script provided at
  /usr/local/www/horde/kronolith/scripts/migrate_to_sql_driver.php.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail >= 6.3.0
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 6.3.0, fetchmail not only needs write
  access to the idfile ($HOME/.fetchids), but also to the directory
  holding this file. For end users running fetchmail with default
  idfile on their own account, nothing changes: they have write
  access to their home directory.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of www/wwwoffle, security/ipsec-tools
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  The startup of the rc.d scripts for these two ports are now
  by default disabled.

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/tovid
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  tovid shell scripts relies heavily on bash(1) but the previous
  port version tried to use sh(1). However, since there were too
  many complications, the port now depends on shells/bash.

  Due to this change, the configuration files need to be regenerated.
  Please, erase all previous configuration files. The configuration
  file samples will be generated on the 1st invocation of the
  scripts:

	$ rm ~/.tovid/*

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/scponly
  AUTHOR: rushani@FreeBSD.org

  From scponly 4.2, scp & WinSCP compatibilities are not enabled by default.
  To enable those compatibilities, define WITH_SCPONLY_SCP and/or
  WITH_SCPONLY_WINSCP, respectively.

20051225:
  AFFECTS: users of p5-libapreq2
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  libapreq2 can be pure c library, I believe some people need pure c library,
  but hate mod_perl, so I split it to 2 ports, and set libapreq2 as
  p5-libapreq2's master ports.

  If you need pure library of libapreq2, install www/libapreq2.
  If you like mod_perl & enjoy p5-libapreq2, install/www/p5-libapreq2.

20051213:
  AFFECTS: users of pear ports
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  A few old pear ports have been removed from the tree in favor of a
  single devel/pear port. If portupgrade complains about missing ports,
  you may safely remove pear-XML_RPC, pear-Console_Getopt, pear-Archive_Tar
  and php[45]-pear and then run:

	portupgrade -o devel/pear -f pear-PEAR

  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail using SSL encryption
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now checks the validity of server certificates and complains
  verbosely in maillog if the validation fails.

  If your mail server's certificate is not signed by one of the root
  authorities, you have to manually configure them using the following steps:

    * Download the necessary certificates in PEM format and store them
      at a suitable location, e.g. /home/user/.certs

    * Run the c_rehash tool on the freshly installed certificates:

      - If you are using OpenSSL from the base system (this is the default)
	use the following command:
	% perl /usr/src/crypto/openssl/tools/c_rehash /home/user/.certs

      - If you are using OpenSSL from security/openssl please use command:
	% c_rehash /home/user/.certs

    * Use the following options to enable SSL encryption in your .fetchmailrc
      configuration file:

      options ssl sslcertpath /home/user/.certs sslcertck
	      sslfingerprint '< fingerprint >'
	      < other options >

  be required.

  The default configuration file location has changed for ipsec-tools.
  You will need to move your racoon configuration files to the new
  location /usr/local/etc/racoon. Alternatively, add this line in

  AFFECTS: users of www/trac
  AUTHOR: rui@ruilopes.com

  The Trac database schema was changed between versions 0.8 and 0.9. This
  port also started to use PySQLite 2 (SQLite 3). Existing environments
  must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.9.

  The canonical update procedure for existing trac environments is:

    $ export TRAC_ENV=/path/to/trac/env
    $ # backup existing trac environment
    $ cp -Rp $TRAC_ENV $TRAC_ENV.backup # backup existing trac env
    $ # convert database from sqlite 2 to sqlite 3 format
    $ mv $TRAC_ENV/db/trac.db $TRAC_ENV/db/trac2.db
    $ sqlite $TRAC_ENV/db/trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 $TRAC_ENV/db/trac.db
    $ # upgrade trac environment
    $ /usr/local/bin/trac-admin $TRAC_ENV upgrade
    $ /usr/local/bin/trac-admin $TRAC_ENV resync
    $ /usr/local/bin/trac-admin $TRAC_ENV wiki upgrade

20051010:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apache-ant
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The Ant launcher script now uses javavmwrapper to pick a suitable JDK. Hence
  it is no longer needed to define JAVA_HOME for Ant to run. You may rather use
  and combination of JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_OS and JAVA_VENDOR. See javavm(1) for
  further information. However, you may still override this behavior using
  JAVACMD.

  The ANT_INCLUDE_SHARED_JARS variable used to be effective only when set to
  "YES" (case sensitive). It is now a defined/undefined switch and thus will be
  effective if defined, regardless of its value.

20051009:

  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded to version 1.0.1. This
  version is incompatible with the previous version. Users of
  rdiff-backup will need to redo their initial seed.

  rdiff-backup-devel has been removed. Users of rdiff-backup-devel
  should now use rdiff-backup instead. In this case there is no need
  to redo the initial seed.

20051006:
  AFFECTS: users of net/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has undergone a major upgrade to version 2.0.3. If you

  accounts on SQL

  bnetd.conf-sample: changed "servaddrs" directive to not be totally commented
  and be as ":" by default in bnetd.conf (if "servaddrs" is commented this
  means "bnetd" will not listen for b.net services at all)

20050902:
  AFFECTS: users of www/jakarta-tomcat55
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The port installs a new RCng startup script which no longer uses tomcat55ctl
  to control the Tomcat daemon. Furthermore, the behavior of Tomcat may be
  configured through switches and variables from /etc/rc.conf. They are

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/kdeadmin3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  One data file has been moved from kdeadmin to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.1 and KDE 3.4.2. This means that

  *********if you currently have the kdeadmin port installed*********

  you will have to take some precautions to update your KDE
  installation.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires
  you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using
  sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

	pkg_deinstall -f kdeadmin-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

	portinstall -O kdeadmin

20050728:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/sge and sysutils/sgeee
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  A port of SGE 6 has been installed in sysutils/sge. SGE 6 is
  significantly different from SGE 5 and an upgrade is only possible
  by removing the SGE 5 install and replacing it. The SGE vs SGEEE
  distinction has been removed in SGE 6 so the sgeee port was removed.
  The sge and sgeee ports were repo copied to sge53 and sgeee53
  respectively and existing installations may continue to use them.

20050727:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird-server
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  Changes in layout:
  * database directory has changed from /usr/local/firebird to /var/db/firebird
  * configuration files are placed in /usr/local/etc/firebird
  * common utilities have been moved to /usr/local/bin
  * suid-ed binaries have been moved to /usr/local/sbin

  Update inetd.conf/xinetd.conf to reflect new location of "fb_inet_server".

20050722:
  AFFECTS: all RELENG_6 and HEAD users of ports/packages, maintainers
	   of ports that interact with the compat libraries.
  AUTHOR: kensmith@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version number of all shared libraries built as
  part of the baseline system has been incremented in both RELENG_6
  and HEAD. The overall goal is to make handling of the compat library
  infrastructure easier. Each new release branch will have different
  version numbers for all of the shared libraries and the compat ports
  can simply include all of the shared libraries from the previous
  release.

  If you update your system using normal cvsup/rebuild/reinstall
  mechanisms the old versions of the libraries will still be on your
  system so your old ports executables will continue to work.
  But you definitely should plan on recompiling and reinstalling all
  of your installed ports so they get relinked against the new libraries.
  If you don't take this step as time goes on "normal" updates and
  installs run the risk of having executables relying on both the new
  and old versions of the libraries which would cause big problems.

  It will take some time for the pre-built packages available on the
  FTP mirror sites to be rebuilt against the new libraries. If you
  want to update your ports using the pre-built packages watch the
  mailing lists for when the rebuilt packages become available.

20050710:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt33, x11/kdelibs3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you have compiled qt33 with the KDE_OPTIONS option checked (if your
  installed qt-package is called qt-copy-3.3.4 instead of qt-3.3.4, check
  with pkg_info), you should cvsup and recompile qt33 and everything
  depending on it:

	portupgrade -rf qt\*

  Previous versions of the qt33 port contained a patch that
  introduces binary incompatibility between unpatched qt33 and software
  compiled against a patched qt33.

  Symptoms of the binary incompatibility: Unresolved symbol warnings from
  various KDE/Qt applications (both during runtime or compiling/linking),
  "Could not start kdeinit" dialogs during KDE startup, kicker crashes during
  exiting KDE.

20050630:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Due to several complaints, new (unsupported) option had been added to port
  Makefile: WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT. Starting with version 7667, NVidia has
  dropped support for numerous "legacy" GPUs, while this option allows to go
  with previous version of driver (this does not apply to older versions of
  FreeBSD, since you have to use version 6113 of driver (if you did not yet
  upgraded to FreeBSD 5.3 or later) which has support for those GPUs).

  If you must use WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT option, be sure to ``hold'' the
  package by making appropriate entry in your pkgtools.conf, otherwise
  portupgrade(1) will upgrade your port to latest NVidia release on the
  next run, which is probably not what you want.

  Refer to x11/nvidia-driver/Makefile for further details.

20050625:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut
  AUTHOR: Joerg.Pulz@frm2.tum.de

  nut now installs a rcNG script for starting the Network UPS Tools daemons.
  To enable that at boot time, add the following into /etc/rc.conf[.local]:

  nut_enable="YES"

20050624:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.7. You should update everything
  depending on perl. The easiest way to do that is to use
  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8. Please see
  its manual page for details.

20050622:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd-*
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  ProFTPd binary moved from ${PREFIX}/libexec to ${PREFIX}/sbin. People
  using proftpd with inetd must use ${PREFIX}/sbin/in.proftpd (or
  ${PREFIX}/sbin/proftpd which is just the same). Read the commit log
  and diffs for more information.

20050621:
  AFFECTS: users of net/cacti
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because of users need to keep their DB configuration but config.php
  can't be saved on upgrading, I've moved DB settings in db-settings.php.
  So, you need to change db-settings.php and do not touch config.php
  anymore.

20050618:
  AFFECTS: users of alternate linux_base ports
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The Ports Collection now allows to override the default linux_base port.
  Specify e.g. OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=rh-9 in /etc/make.conf to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-rh-9 (the logic is to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-${OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT}).

20050610:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/wget built with SSL (default)
  AUTHOR: sf@FreeBSD.org

  wget 1.10 now authenticates certificate of remote host before making a
  SSL connection. To make it work, you should have working CA root
  certificates list in /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

  If you don't have it there are options:
  a) install security/ca-roots port and you have done.
  b) install ftp/curl port and symlink it to /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
      ln -s /usr/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  c) put your favorite one into certain place.

20050601:

20050526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sylpheed-claws
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  Sylpheed-claws is updated to the GTK2 version now. This results in a new
  configuration directory. To keep your configuration from the GTK1 version
  you can
      cp -rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2
  before starting the GTK2 version for the first time, or
      cp -Rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2/
  when you have run the GTK2 version already.

20050524:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mpeg4ip and multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.3 mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installs libmp4av that mpeg4ip
  previously installed. It is advised to de-install mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and
  mpeg4ip before updating to mpeg4ip-1.3 or mpeg4ip-libmp4v2-1.3. If you
  have already updated mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and mpeg4ip you should deinstall
  mpeg4ip and reinstall mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 before updating mpeg4ip.

  This does not affect users who just have mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installed
  and not mpeg4ip.

20050523:
  AFFECTS: users of games/pvpgn
  AUTHOR: mek@mek.uz.ua

  The following has been changed in the bnetd.conf file (starting with
  version 1.7.7):
    - The old config variable `servername' has been renamed to `hostname'.
    - A new `servername' config variable has been introduced for server
      identification.

20050519:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  Starting with 2.5.10, the cachemgr.cgi program uses a configuration file
  cachemgr.conf to control which hosts this program is allowed to manage.
  To prevent abuse, the configuration defaults to "localhost" only.
  Please see cachemgr.cgi(8) for further details.

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2 and all ports depending on it
  AUTHOR: lars.eggert@gmx.net.

  API changed for mod_perl2 -- existing code will break!
  The mod_perl2 developers have significantly changed the API
  in release candidate 2.0.0-RC5. These changes include changed
  names for core packages, causing software that uses the old API
  to fail with the new version. You need to update your code as
  described in http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/rename.html

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird
  AUTHOR: freebsd@galle.com.br

  The port was split into a -server and -client parts.
  The -server contains server binary, UDFs, and install all in
  ${PREFIX}/firebird. The -client contains libs, includes,
  client binaries, docs and examples. For migration delete
  the firebird port and install the -server and/or -client port
  afterwards.

20050512:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/svk
  AUTHOR: rafan@infor.org

  Since SVK 0.30, it is fast enough and PPerl causes some problems.
  Thus, the SVK port no longer supports WITH_PPERL knob.
  If you still want to use PPerl with it, please go and read:
  http://svk.elixus.org/?SVKAndPPerl for details.

20050511:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg{,-devel}
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  The latest FreeBSD CVS snapshot has been committed under
  multimedia/ffmepg-devel. In order to build it, you need to deinstall
  any ffmpeg ports first:

	# pkg_deinstall multimedia/ffmpeg

  Furthermore, video capture is no longer working in the latest
  version. Work is been done to overcome this.

20050511:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|contrib)
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports have been updated to latest versions. A
  security problem in the template database requires a simple SQL
  command to be run on each database. Because these problems are
  really incorrect system catalog entries, updating to a new release
  will NOT by itself solve the problems in an existing
  installation.

  See http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.315 for details.

20050501:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml based applications and libraries
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent update of ocaml to 3.08.3 some API compatibility
  has been broken. It is a bit subtle so that some users might not
  notice it. However, updating all ocaml based applications and
  libraries are advised using the new compiler/interpreter version.
  Issue the following command:

  	# portupgrade -rf 'ocaml*'

20050426:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-authlib
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  mail/courier-authlib has been moved to security/courier-authlib and is
  now only a meta-port. Installing the meta-port installs security/
  courier-authlib-base and no, one or more sub-ports regarding to what
  authentication methods you've chosen. Courier-authlib-base only
  provides you authentication via PAM. All ports depending on courier-
  authlib (at the time of writing, courier-imap, sqwebmail and maildrop)
  giving you the same choice the meta-port provides you.

20050421:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera-devel
  AUTHOR: avleeuwen@piwebs.com

  Opera 8.0 final has been released and can be installed via the
  www/opera port. The opera-devel port is now deprecated. If you want
  to continue using the personal settings you used with www/opera-devel,
  issue this command:

	# mv ~/.opera-devel ~/.opera

20050421:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: avleeuwen@piwebs.com

  Opera has been updated to 8.0. If are upgrading from version 7.x or
  below, it is recommended that you backup your personal ~/.opera
  directory and remove it, like this:

	# cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-bak
	# rm -rf ~/.opera

  After that, you can put your bookmarks, email, contacts, etc. back in
  ~/.opera/. The most important files are your bookmarks
  (~/.opera/opera6.adr) and your emails (~/.opera/mail). It is not a good
  idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini, pluginpath.ini and other
  non-personal stuff back in ~/.opera/. If you need custom settings,
  reconfigure Opera from the Preferences pane or edit the files by hand.

20050420:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ipython
  AUTHOR: dryice@liu.com.cn

  There are backward-incompatible changes for pysh:

  1. You must update your pysh profile (~/.ipython/ipythonrc-pysh):
     a) Add to it the line:
	import_all IPython.Extensions.InterpreterExec
     b) Delete the line:
	execfile pysh.py
  2. You must also delete from ~/.ipython/ the file pysh.py.

20050419:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Opera has been updated to 8.0. If you are upgrade from version 7.x or

  directory and remove it. It can be done following from the command line:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak
	# rm -rf ~/.linux-opera

  After that, you can put your bookmark, email, contacts and etc back in
  ~/.linux-opera/. The bookmark is ~/.linux-opera/opera6.adr and the email is
  ~/.linux-opera/mail as you can figure out by view in ~/.linux-opera/. It is
  probably not good idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini,
  pluginpath.ini and other non-personal stuff back in ~/.linux-opera/. The
  non-personal stuff should be re-configure on new stuff by either Opera
  preferences in GUI or hand (manual) in your editor.

20050414:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports are updated to 8.0.2. All shared libraries'
  versions have been bumped, so you will need to recompile all client
  applications that depend on libpq.so. The recommended way to
  upgrade from 8.0.x would be something like

  	portupgrade -rf postgresql-client

20050413:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamd

  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

  You can also pass flags to tac_plus by setting the rc.conf variable
  tac_plus_flags. The default flags are "-C ${PREFIX}/etc/tac_plus.conf".

  Additionally, the default version of IOS for tac_plus has been changed from
  11.x to 12.x.

20050324:
  AFFECTS: users of net/mDNSResponder
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  In mDNSResponder 98_1, mdnsd is no longer started by default due to a

	x11-themes/kdeartwork3, www/akregator, x11-themes/phase,
	multimedia/kdemultimedia3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  In KDE 3.4, a number of files were moved between ports, some ports
  were added, one port has been removed and some applications formerly available
  in their own ports were incorporated into KDE. This means that you will have
  to take some precautions to update your KDE installation. A simple
  portupgrade -a will not work.

  Portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched until you log out and back
  in.

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeartwork-\[0-9\]\* kdebase-\[0-9\]\* \
	kdebase-konqueror-nsplugins-\[0-9\]\* kdewebdev-\[0-9\]\* \
	kde-\[0-9\]\* akregator\* phase\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

      	portinstall -O kdebase kdeartwork kdewebdev

   Changes in detail:

	- www/akregator is now included into deskutils/kdepim3.
	- x11-themes/phase is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.
	- www/konqueror-nsplugins has been removed and is now integrated into
	  x11/kdebase3.
	- Juk has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
	  available as audio/juk.
	- Akode has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
	  available as audio/akode and audio/akode-plugins-*. Akode is also
	  a default dependency of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 now.
	- audio/mpeglib_artsplug has been demoted to legacy status and is no
	  longer the default decoder backend for kdemultimedia3. It's also not
	  depended on by kdemultimedia3 by default anymore.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again (also see
    http://freebsd.kde.org/faq.php#q16).

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running (as root or with sudo)

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdm configuration (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration. Especially note that kdm does not use the Xservers
    file anymore. A genkdmconf run will merge its contents into kdmrc.

  Extensive information about changes and new features of KDE 3.4 can be found
  at http://developer.kde.org/development-versions/kde-3.4-features.html. Bugs
  can be reported at http://bugs.kde.org.

20050320:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portsnap
  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of shifting from SHA-1 to SHA-256, the structure of
  portsnap's configuration file and compressed snapshot have both
  changed. After upgrading to portsnap 0.9, you will have to
  update your configuration file ($PREFIX/etc/portsnap.conf) and
  delete your existing portsnap compressed snapshot:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf
  	# rm -r /usr/local/portsnap/*

  In addition, be aware that the next runs of "portsnap fetch" and
  "portsnap update" will take far longer than usual, since they
  will need to download and extract a complete copy of the ports
  tree.

20050319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7[34]-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script has been merged from 8.0 to 7.3 and 7.4. Hence,
  to start the PostgreSQL server at boot time (regardless of version),
  add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  postgresql_enable=yes

  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/blackbox, x11-wm/boxtools, x11-wm/bbkeys, and
	x11-wm/bbpager
  AUTHOR: A.J.Caines@halplant.com

  The new blackbox ports include several changes to use and configuration.
  Please read the pkg-message files in the respective ports for details.

20050315:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql323-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The MySQL daemon must now be enabled/disabled in rc.conf.
  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  See the script for details.

20050314:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql40-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

20050313:
  AFFECTS: users of games/netpanzerdata, games/netpanzer
  AUTHOR: mad@madpilot.net

  The netpanzerdata port has changed it's name to netpanzer-data,
  so before installing the new one you will need to remove the old
  netpanzerdata-0.1.3 port.

20050312:
  AFFECTS: all users who have glib/gtk/gnome libraries installed
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org and the FreeBSD GNOME team

  Gnome has been upgraded to 2.10 and gtk/glib to 2.6.
  DO NOT USE portupgrade(1) to update any gnome or gtk
  or any port that depends on them. Using portupgrade
  will cause problems and you will have to manually
  upgrade ports. Please use the gnome_upgrade.sh
  script from
    http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/gnome_upgrade.sh

20050309:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/maildrop
  AUTHOR: sergei@FreeBSD.org

  maildrop has been recently upgraded to 1.8.0. This version
  has the following changes:

  - Maildir quota is now enabled by default.
    The following options were deleted:
    - WITH_MAILDIRQUOTA
    - WITH_TRASHQUOTA
  - New option WITH_AUTHLIB is added, which provides optional support for
    Courier Auth Library (mail/courier-authlib port).
  - Userdb authentication, LDAP and MySQL support are provided through
    courier-authlib now, thus the following options
    - WITH_USERDB
    - WITH_LDAP
    - WITH_MYSQL
    have been superseded by WITH_AUTHLIB.

20050306:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  ploticus is now installed as bin/ploticus rather than bin/pl to
  avoid useless conflicts with other ports.

20050303:
  AFFECTS: users of net/i2p
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  The newest i2p version 0.5.0.1 is incompatible with all previous
  versions. Follow these procedures if you are updating from a
  previous port version. You can ignore these if you are installing
  i2p for the first time.

  1) Update i2p port to the new one
  2) Use the i2prouter script to uninstall i2p from user account.
     You are going to lose all your configuration:

	$ i2prouter uninstall

  3) Install the new i2p version:

	$ i2prouter install

20050301:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ganglia-monitor-core
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  With the move to Ganglia 3.0.0, the configuration file for gmond has
  changed completely. The -r or --convert options may be used to
  emit a file in the new format given one in the old.

  Startup is now controlled by an RC_SUBR script so the gmond_enable and
  gmetad_enable variables will need to be set for gmond and gmetad to be
  started. Existing gmond.sh and gmetad.sh scripts in PREFIX/etc/rc.d
  should be removed.

  Due to a bug in ganglia's build process, the previous version may need
  to be removed before ganglia can be upgraded.

20050224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby18 and any apps that depend on ruby18
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The theads support has been disabled again. It causes the more trouble, so
  it now builds with ${PTHREAD_CFLAGS} and ${PTHREAD_LIBS}. It is recommend
  you to rebuild any apps that depend on lang/ruby18. Do something like this:

  	portupgrade -rf ruby-1.8.2\*

20050224:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache21
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from 2.1.2, you need to rebuild all apache modules.

20050215:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql41-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

20050214:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios
  AUTHOR: blaz@si.FreeBSD.org

  Nagios has been upgraded to 2.0.b2. Native support for storing various types
  of data (status, retention, comment, downtime, etc.) in MySQL and PostgreSQL
  has been dropped. There are also multiple changes to the format of
  configuration files. Carefully read
  http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/2_0/whatsnew.html before upgrading.

20050213:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX-* are now based on teTeX 3.0. Although some reliability fixes
  are also added, here are several common problems which you might fall on.

  1) $PREFIX/bin/pdftex is missing:

    Probably your system has old files included teTeX 2.x which can
    prevent the new version from working. Please remove the old files
    first (see entry 20050206 in this file) and reinstall.

  2) Some formats are still corrupted (for example, "Fatal format file error;
     I'm stymied" is displayed) or not updated even after a clean install:

    You might have old or corrupted *.fmt and/or *.map files under
    /root/.texmf-* or $HOME/.texmf-* directories. Typically these
    directories are generated when you invoke the updmap(1), texconfig(1),
    or fmtutil(1) utility manually. However, for a period after the first
    revision of the teTeX-base port erroneously used fmtutil(1) to
    regenerate *.fmt files, you could have these directories without your
    intent. In such a case, please remove these directories and reinstall
    the ports (it is not needed to rebuild ports/packages).  Just for your
    information, $HOME/.texmf-config and $HOME/.texmf-var can be used for
    your personal configuration.

  If you have other problems, please contact hrs@FreeBSD.org.

20050212:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/mkbold, x11-fonts/mkitalic, and
	   x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic
  AUTHOR: koma2@ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp

  The dependency on x11-fonts/mkbold and x11-fonts/mkitalic has been
  switched over to x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic, which is written in C
  and has far better performance than the old ones. There is no
  functional difference between the two, but they will conflict with
  each other. Since other ports which depend on x11-fonts/mkbold or
  x11-fonts/mkitalic will be updated to depend on x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic,
  you might get an error during upgrading such ports. In such a case,
  please pkg_delete the old ones first.

20050206:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX and japanese/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX is now based on a teTeX 3.0 release candidate
  (2.99.13.20050204) and the other related ports are also updated.
  Since upgrading from previous versions should be done at a time,
  you may want to use the portupgrade utility or reinstall
  print/teTeX after deinstalling all of the related ports.

  If your teTeX environment became broken during the upgrade,
  please see the following URL which explains how to fix it.

  http://people.freebsd.org/~hrs/tetex-upgrade.txt

  This file also includes notes for people who are familiar
  with the teTeX distribution to explain structure of the ports.

20050205:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby16_r, lang/ruby18_r, and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  The slippery pthread support for systems prior to 502102 has been
  dropped and lang/ruby16_r and lang/ruby18_r ports have been removed,
  since no one seems to appreciate the partially working solution.

  Good news is that the pthread support of lang/ruby18 is now enabled
  by default for newer systems, which means the ruby interpreter is
  linked with libpthread. This will allow threaded extension
  libraries to run and work properly on those systems.

20050201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5 and lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5 has been updated to 5.6.2, and lang/perl5.8 has been
  updated to 5.8.6. You should update everything depending on perl, that
  is:

    * first, upgrade your perl installation (use either lang/perl5 or
      lang/perl5.8, the latter being recommended);
    * for FreeBSD 4.X, run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you
      have 5.8.6 or 5.6.2; this step is not needed on FreeBSD 5.X and
      FreeBSD -CURRENT;
    * run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like:
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5\* | tail +4; \
	find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.[68].[1245] -type f -print0 \
	| xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //') | sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards by hand.

20050130:
  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  Each of the PostgreSQL ports have been split into a server and a
  client part. Please use postgresqlNN-server and/or
  postgresqlNN-client as needed. Versions currently supported are 7.3,
  7.4 and 8.0.

  To start the PostgreSQL server at boot time, add the following to
  /etc/rc.conf:

  postgresql_enable=yes

  The maintenance script is installed in etc/periodic/daily, and is
  controlled by a set of new knobs in periodic.conf. Use it for
  vacuuming your databases and get daily backups. Note that daily
  vacuuming is on by default. See the script for details.

20050130:
  AFFECTS: users of net/howl
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Howl now installs an rcNG script for starting mDNSResponder. To enable
  mDNSResponder to start at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  mdnsresponder_enable="YES"

  You can also pass flags to mDNSResponder by setting the rc.conf variable
  mdnsresponder_flags to the appropriate value. See the mDNSResponder(8)
  man page for the list of supported flags. The default is not to pass
  any flags to mDNSResponder.

20050126:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  If you use Xorg 6.8.1: Make sure there is an /tmp/.ICE-unix with propper
  rights. For further informations about that, please refer to 20041229
  Please update all your plugins as well when you update from 4.0.6 to 4.2
  They all need recompiling to link against the new xfce libraries

20050122:
  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: seanc@FreeBSD.org

  The -devel port has been updated to contain 8.0 release since
  postgresql80-server can not be updated until 4.11 is released and the
  changes in PR ports/75344 are committed. Users who need 8.0 now can
  use the -devel port, however, once postgresql80-server has been
  committed, -devel will begin tracking 8.1. Please be smart about
  tracking ports and if used in production, update to
  databases/postgresql80-server as soon as it becomes available. No
  dump/reload will be required when changing from -devel to
  postgresql80-server.

20050117:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spambnc
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

The SpamBouncer has been upgraded from version 1.9 to 2.0-RC3, and you
have to modify your ~/.procmailrc files. Please read upgrading.html in
/usr/local/share/doc/spambnc.

20050117:
  AFFECTS: users of cad/astk-client
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  ASTK has been moved; if there exists files $HOME/.astkrc/config_serveurs,
  you have to update the entry rep_serv from /usr/local/ASTK/ASTK_SERV/bin
  to /usr/local/aster/ASTK/ASTK_SERV/bin (or you can remove $HOME/.astkrc).

20050114:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgnomesu, esp. on FreeBSD 4.x.
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  If you installed libgnomesu the day it was added to the ports tree,
  you have a malformed PAM control file in /etc/pam.d/. All libgnomesu
  users should remove /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam, and 5.x users should
  replace it with the version in the updated libgnomesu port (ensure
  that you're using the most current revision of the libgnomesu port).

  4.x users: listen up! The presence of the /etc/pam.d/ directory (and
  anything in that directory) presents a Very Bad Thing. Unless you've
  manually tweaked your PAM settings, you must run:

  	# rm /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam
  	# rmdir /etc/pam.d/

  or all users will be locked out of your system!

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/iip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  iip has been updated to the new network servers. Therefore, both
  old configuration files and node reference keys no longer apply.

  Therefore, you need to update the configuration files for each
  user running the iip isproxy daemon:

  1) Backup configuration files:

	cp ~/.iip/isproxy.ini ~/.iip/isproxy.ini.backup
	cp ~/.iip/node.ref ~/.iip/node.ref.backup

  2) Remove configuration files:

	rm ~/.iip/isproxy.ini
	rm ~/.iip/node.ref

  3) Create new configuration. Fill information as requested. This
  creates the updated isproxy.ini file:

	isproxy -C

  4) Start iip isproxy. This will initialize your updated node.ref
  file. This file will be automatically updated when you connect
  to the iip network:

	isproxy

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nautilus-cd-burner
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Nautilus-cd-burner now requires cdrtools built with UTF-8 encoding
  support. The default sysutils/cdrtools port does not support this
  encoding, and that will cause nautilus-cd-burner to enter an infinite
  loop when trying to create CD images. To workaround this, the cdrtools
  dependency was changed in nautilus-cd-burner to point to the
  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port instead.

  Since sysutils/cdrtools and sysutils/cdrtools-cjk conflict, you must
  uninstall cdrtools so that the nautilus-cd-burner update can properly
  pull in cdrtools-cjk.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap, mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-imap and sqwebmail are now dependent on courier-authlib. If
  you've changed the default authentication config for courier-imap or
  sqwebmail, you will have to redo the changes for courier-authlib.
  You may wish to deinstall courier-imap and/or sqwebmail before you
  install courier-authlib. Since courier-authlib replaces parts of both
  ports, some of courier-authlib's files are listed as sqwebmail and
  courier-imap files and deinstalling old courier-imap and/or sqwebmail
  port may cause the deinstallation of the freshly installed
  courier-authlib files.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Sqwebmail now installs it's files directly under PREFIX. That means for
  instance that files that were formerly found under
  PREFIX/share/sqwebmail/etc/ are now located under PREFIX/etc/sqwebmail.
  Furthermore you need to set sqwebmaild_enable=YES in your rc.conf
  because the rc.d script has been migrated to use the rc.subr Subsystem

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  The variable courier_imap_imapdssl_enable have been renamed to
  courier_imap_imapd_ssl_enable.
  The variable courier_imap_pop3dssl_enable have been renamed to
  courier_imap_pop3d_ssl_enable.
  userdb stuff is now located in LOCALBASE/etc/authlib instead of
  LOCALBASE/etc.

20041231:
  AFFECTS: users of www/awstats
  AUTHOR: webmaster@lightningfire.net

  Location of awstats changed from /usr/local/www to /usr/local/www/awstats.
  Please update configuration according instructions in pkg-message.

20041231:
  AFFECTS: users of the linux compatibility environment
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The default linux_base was changed from v7 to v8. You need to update from
  v7 to v8 and rebuild every linux port. To update run:

	portupgrade -rf -o emulators/linux_base-8 emulators/linux_base

  In case you already use linux_base-8 you have to run:

	portupgrade -rf emulators/linux_base-8

20041229:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3, x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  If KDE does not start anymore after upgrading Xorg to version 6.8.1
  (X restarts when the KDE splash screen has reached the third icon),
  please check whether the directory /tmp/.ICE-unix exists, is owned by root
  and has permissions 1777 (read/write/access for everybody + sticky bit).

  To make sure everything is in working order, do (as root):

	mkdir -p /tmp/.ICE-unix && chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix &&
	chown root:wheel /tmp/.ICE-unix

  Also, make sure you do NOT have clear_tmp_enable="YES" set in /etc/rc.conf,
  as it will remove the directory on every reboot and applications will re-
  create it with the wrong ownership.

  Users of daily_clean_tmps_enable in /etc/periodic.conf should make sure
  daily_clean_tmps_ignore contains /tmp/.ICE-unix.

20041227:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/gambas
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  As of this update, the password of your databases connections are crypted.
  If you were using the database manager, please remove
  ~/.gambas/gambas-database-manager.conf before launching the new version.

20041226:
  AFFECTS: users of Horde and the related ports (Turba, IMP, Nag, Kronolith,
	   Mnemo, Chora)
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  As of this update, the configuration files are generated by the application,
  with no support for configuration files used in previous versions.

  All data saved in the database, LDAP or MCAL backends will be preserved,
  considering that you run specific scripts to migrate to this new scheme.
  Affected ports are www/horde, mail/turba, deskutils/nag, deskutils/kronolith,
  and deskutils/mnemo. See the UPGRADING documentation of the ports in question
  for more details.

  The filter system of IMP 3.x has been replaced by a separate application:
  check the port mail/ingo. Ingo provides a script to migrate the existing
  filter rules from IMP 3.x, see Ingo's documentation.

20041224:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/XFree86-4-Server and graphics/dri
  AUTHOR: lesi@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 4.4.0_6, XFree86-4-Server now depends on
  graphics/xfree86-dri. This is due to incompatibilities between
  XFree86 and the new xorg 6.8.1 DRI.

  Users of XFree86-4-Server are strongly encouraged to switch to
  the xfree86-dri port as follows:

	portupgrade -fo graphics/xfree86-dri graphics/dri

  which will also fix dependencies.

20041224:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Please upgrade sysutils/portupgrade prior to lang/ruby18, or
  pkgdb(1) may coredump with a double free() problem from a misuse (or
  a "feature") of the DL module.

  In that case, you can reinstall sysutils/portupgrade manually.

20041222:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav, security/clamav-devel
  AUTHOR: jylefort@brutele.be

  The ClamAV database path has changed from /usr/local/share/clamav to

20041221:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme03
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  security/gpgme03 has been modified to not conflicts with gpgme 1.x
  After upgrade, you need to rebuild all ports that depend on it.
  You should upgrade security/gpgme (if installed) to avoid nasty
  compile time failures, due to original location of gpgme.h.

20041219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/jdictionary
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The location for JDictionary port installed files has changed. This also

  The cryptplug port is not compatible with recent versions of gpgme
  and has been changed to depend on gpgme03 (the last version of gpg-
  me compatible with cryptplug).
  Users who have been using cryptplug in order to enable PGP/MIME support
  in KMail should DEINSTALL BOTH cryptplug and gpgme03 before updating
  KDE to version 3.3.2. Cryptplug is NOT necessary anymore to enable
  PGP/MIME support in KMail and will cause the kdepim3 build to fail due
  to conflicting dependencies.

    postgresqlrelay_enable="YES"

20041212:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula
  AUTHOR: lkoeller@FreeBSD.org

  The port was split into a -server and -client component.
  The -server part contains the storage and director daemon, the -client
  part the console, file daemon and the documentation.

  For migration delete the bacula port and install the -server and/or
  -client port afterwards.

  AUTHOR: question+fbsdports@closedsrc.org

  There is a known quirk when using mail/getmail with Python 2.4
  where the DeprecationWarning is printed regarding the use of
  the 'strict' keyword when a message is being retrieved.

  You can redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null to quelch the warning.

  The quirk may be fixed in a future version of getmail.

20041205:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/ffmpeg will not work if previous versions of the port
  are installed. Also, there is a shared library version bump on
  this update. Therefore:

  1) Remove old ffmpeg

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/ffmpeg*

  2) Install updated ffmpeg

  3) Rebuild all ports that depend on ffmpeg due to the shared
  library version bump

  cd /var/db/pkg && portupgrade -rf ffmpeg* -x ffmpeg*

20041202:
  AFFECTS: users of any ports which have dependency on lang/python
  AUTHOR: perky@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading of lang/python, you must rebuild all its consumer
  ports to make them get ready to Python 2.4.

  To do this, you will need to:
    pkgdb -uf && cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  AFFECTS: users of news/rawdog
  AUTHOR: tim@bishnet.net

  Rawdog 2.x changes the format of the state file used in 1.x. To
  upgrade from 1.x to 2.x the rawdog author recommends the following:

    cp -R ~/.rawdog ~/.rawdog-old
    rm ~/.rawdog/state
    rawdog -u
    rawdog --upgrade ~/.rawdog-old ~/.rawdog
    rawdog -w

  Once you're happy with the new version:
    rm -r ~/.rawdog-old

20041118:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  portsdb(1) is part of the portupgrade suite and is used to convert a ports
  INDEX file to a binary INDEX.db database. By default, it uses the
  libc-builtin berkeley db to do so, which has a buggy btree implementation.

  If you see errors like "[BUG] Segmentation fault" while a portsdb update is
  in progress, adjust the PORTS_DBDRIVER variable (in your environment or in
  pkgtools.conf) to either bdb1_hash or dbm_hash.

  This problem was fixed in 5.3-RELEASE, but users of 4.10-RELEASE and
  5.2.1-RELEASE (and older releases) will find fixes by updating to the
  latest (at least after Sep 20) of RELENG_4 or RELENG_5.

20041116:
  AFFECTS: users of www/bricolage
  AUTHOR: ports@rbt.ca

  Bricolage may now be run on mod_perl compiled as a DSO for Apache
  when following these guidelines:

  http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#When_DSO_can_be_Used

  To do this, you will need to:

	pkg_delete -f apache-mod_perl
	pkg_delete -f p5-libapreq-static
	portupgrade -rR bricolage

  Bricolage will rebuild mod_perl, apache and libapreq using their standard
  versions.

20041115:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the recent removal of INDEX and INDEX-5 from FreeBSD's CVS,
  portupgrade with default configuration will run 'make index' if started
  after cvsup'ing the ports-collection. This may take an undesirably long
  time.

  There are several ways to work around this, for example:

  - Run 'make fetchindex' after cvsup'ing ports,

  or:

  - Adjust the PORTS_INDEX variable in your environment or in
    pkgtools.conf (see portupgrade(1) or the default pkgtools.conf) to
    a different value than the default.

  Also remember that 'make index' is only supported on _complete_
  ports-trees. If you are currently refusing whole categories by means
  of a cvsup refuse file, use 'make fetchindex' instead (or consider
  keeping an extra machine/jail with a complete ports-tree around to
  do INDEX builds on).

20041111:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/faad, multimedia/mpeg4ip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  mpeg4ip has been updated and broken down into 2 separate ports:
  mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2. Furthermore, mpeg4ip now depends
  on faad. Moreover, faad now depends on mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 rather
  than on mpeg4ip which avoids a cyclic dependency (mpeg4ip depends
  on faad which depends on mpeg4ip).

  If any of the old ports are installed, mpeg4ip will not compile.
  Therefore,

  1) Remove old faad and mpeg4ip ports which conflict with new
  mpeg4ip

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/mpeg4ip*
  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/faad*

  2) Install faad, mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 in the following
  order

  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/audio/faad && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip && make install clean

20041111:
  AFFECTS: users of Java
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  javavmwrapper has been rewritten. It now creates symbolic links for
  all executables of the Java VMs that have been registered with it.
  These symbolic links may impact which version of Java you are using,
  depending on your PATH, which may need to be adjusted.

  For example, if your path is:

	${LOCALBASE}/bin:${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin

  then previously "java" would resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java.
  With the new javavmwrapper it will resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.
  Depending upon the Java VMs that are registered and various environment
  variables, it may or may not be ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java that is
  run by javavmwrapper via the symbolic link ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.

	   are running FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or later (including -current)
  AUTHOR: kensmith@FreeBSD.org

  As part of the FreeBSD-5.3 release the following system libraries
  had their version number incremented:

	/lib/libm.so.2 -> libm.so.3
	/lib/libreadline.so.4 -> libreadline.so.5
	/usr/lib/libhistory.so.4 -> libhistory.so.5
	/usr/lib/libopie.so.2 -> libopie.so.3
	/usr/lib/libpcap.so.2 -> libpcap.so.3

  This should have no effect unless you are using FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or
  higher, or if you are a -current user who upgraded after this date.
  Assuming you did a from-source upgrade new versions of these libraries
  will be created but the old versions will be left behind (for example
  /lib/libm.so.2 will be the old one, /lib/libm.so.3 will be the new one).
  Any ports or pre-built packages you have currently installed will
  continue to use the old library, any ports you install after the upgrade
  will begin to use the new library. You will need to have all your
  ports recompiled before the old library goes away. To help with the
  migration you could also use /etc/libmap.conf to map libm.so.2 to
  libm.so.3.

20040830:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  In KDE 3.3, a number of files were moved between ports and some ports
  were removed. This means that you will have to take some precautions
  to update your KDE installation. A simple portupgrade -a will not work.
  portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched during the update.

  1.) First, make sure your ports index is up to date.

      	cd /usr/ports && make index

      or, if you're using the sysutils/portindex port

      	portindex

  2.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeaddons-kontact-plugins-\* \
      	kdeaddons-kaddressbook-plugins-\* kdepim-\* kdeutils-\* \
      	kdeaddons-\[0-9\]\* kde-\[0-9\]\*

      kdegraphics now conflicts with the kolourpaint package and kdeedu now
      conflicts with the kwordquiz package. If you have kwordquiz and/or
      kolourpaint installed on your system and you want to use the kdegraphics/
      kdeedu ports, you should first deinstall the conflicting packages:

      	pkg_deinstall -f kolourpaint\* kwordquiz\*


  3.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade arts\* kde\* quanta\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

      Note that the quanta port has been renamed to kdewebdev. The commands
      above will automatically replace quanta with kdewebdev, if you have
      quanta installed.

  4.) Reinstall any KDE ports you deleted in step 2. Note that the kdeaddons-
      kontact-plugins (net/kontact-plugins), kdepim-kpilot (palm/kpilot) and
      quanta (www/quanta) ports/packages do not exist anymore and cannot be
      reinstalled.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again.

  - KMail has been heavily modified since KDE 3.2.x. Testing shows that KMail
    can display erratic behavior and crashes after the update. If you see any
    such behavior, it is recommended to simply close KMail and start it again
    until it resumes normal operation.

    The integration of GnuPG and KMail for signing, encrypting and verifying
    PGP/MIME mail has also changed. A quick howto is available at
    http://freebsd.kde.org/howtos/gnupg-kmail.php.

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdmrc (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration.

  Optional step 4.) Run, as root: genkdmconf (without any options) to update
  your kdmrc to the latest configuration file format

  Note for advanced users: Substitute /usr/local with your custom PREFIX if
  you're using one.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org, mat@FreeBSD.org, marcus@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.5. You should update everything
  depending on perl, that is:

    * first, upgrade your perl5.8 installation.
    * run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you have 5.8.5.
    * now, run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like:
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5.8.5 | tail +4; \
	find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.[124] -type f -print0 \
	| xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //') | sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards.
      Please note, that this last step is, strictly speaking, not necessary,
      if you are upgrading from 5.8.4. But it is cleaner to do so anyway.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/apache-ant
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to Ant 1.6.2 introduces the following changes which may break
  older environments, according to the 1.6.2 release notes:

  . The import task used the canonical version of a file path. This
    has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 28505.
  . ant-xalan2.jar has been removed since the only class contained
    in it didn't depend on Xalan-J 2 at all. Its sole dependency has
    always been TraX and so it has been merged into ant-trax.jar.
  . All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a buildexception
    giving the location in the buildfile of the task.
  . Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to
    the Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.
  . <junitreport> will very likely no longer work with Xalan-J 1.

  AFFECTS: users for xorg and GNOME
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  After migrating from XFree86 to X.Org, you must rebuild
  x11-toolkits/libwnck and x11/libxklavier for full GNOME functionality
  to be restored.

  If you receive an XKB initialization error when starting GNOME, edit
  your XF86Config or xorg.conf, and remove the line:

Option "XkbRules" "xfree86"

20040723:
  AFFECTS: users of FreeBSD-current, users of X.Org
  AUTHOR: anholt@FreeBSD.org

  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is deprecated and has been replaced by the
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may be set to xorg, xfree86-4, or
  xfree86-3. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM defaults to xorg on FreeBSD-current. If you are
  switching to xorg, you should follow this set of commands to cleanly upgrade:

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/imake-4* /var/db/pkg/XFree86-*
  cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg && make install
  pkgdb -F

  Users of -stable or older -current can switch to X.Org by setting
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM=xorg in make.conf and following the same process.

  Alternately, FreeBSD 5.x and later users can use portupgrade with packages:
    cd /var/db/pkg
    portupgrade -o devel/imake-6 imake-4*
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-libraries XFree86-libraries
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-clients XFree86-clients
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-manpages XFree86-manuals

  AFFECTS: users of PHP
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old lang/php4 and lang/php5 ports have been split into 'base' PHP,
  PEAR, and shared extensions to allow more flexibility and add new features.
  Upgrading your current PHP installation will result in a 'base' PHP
  installation (no PEAR and no extensions).
  PEAR can be found in the new devel/php4-pear and devel/php5-pear ports, while
  the set of PHP extensions to install can be chosen via the meta-ports
  lang/php4-extensions and lang/php5-extensions, or installing singular
  extensions individually.
  If you have a previous php.ini configuration file, be sure to comment out
  the extension_dir parameter, since the correct path is statically compiled
  into the PHP binary.
  For an overview of the modules used with the old PHP binary, use
  the command "php -m".

20040717:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap21{,-sasl}-client
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default. To upgrade all ports do
    portupgrade -rfo net/openldap22-client openldap-client
  (or a similar command for the SASL variant). If you do not want to
  upgrade, add the line `WANT_OPENLDAP_VER?=21' to /etc/make.conf

  Note that when you want to upgrade openldap21{,sasl}-server, you have
  to use slapcat/slapadd to migrate the database, since the internal
  format is not binary compatible. Simply upgrading the server without
  doing a slapcat first can corrupt your database.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim on FreeBSD 5.x
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  The default location of the startup script has been changed to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d. When you depend on the previous behavior,
  build the port with WITH_RCORDER=yes.

  Setting WITH_OPENLDAP_VER and WITH_MYSQL_VER do not automatically
  imply the corresponding WITH_ variable. The use of these options
  is discouraged, use the global settings (WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and
  DEFAULT_MYSQL_VER) to set system wide defaults.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/milter-sender
  AUTHOR: vs@FreeBSD.org

  Milter-sender version 0.58 released.
  When updating to version 0.58, beware if you have a personalized
  configuration file (milter-sender.cf). The meaning of the
  MxAcceptsAllAction variable has changed and its default has changed
  from 4 to 6. If this variable is not updated, greylisting might be
  more aggressive than expected.

20040708:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Opera 7.52 released.
  The file search.ini has been changed to ensure correct default
  addresses for dictionary and encyclopedia searches. Existing
  versions will be overwritten on upgrade. Users who have a
  customized search.ini file that they would like to keep, should
  edit its version number to 4 before upgrading. Note that you
  have to edit the search.ini file located in the /.opera folder.

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/xdvik-vflib*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/xdvik-vflib no longer supports VFlib2, and now depends on
  print/freetype2. For the configuration details, see vfontmap file which
  installed as texmf/xdvi/vfontmap. japanese/kochi-ttfonts is used for
  min and goth by default.

  xdvik-vflib-pk* variants has been removed because pkfonts are already included
  in the teTeX distribution.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX has been split into print/teTeX-base and print/teTeX-texmf,
  and print/teTeX is now a meta-port for the two and print/dvipsk-tetex and
  print/xdvik. print/teTeX installs dvips and xdvi by default again (via
  print/dvipsk-tetex and print/xdvik). For people who want to use teTeX,
  simply install print/teTeX with options set by default.

  print/teTeX-base has additional options for adding xdvi and dvips included
  in the teTeX distribution itself, but use of them are not recommended if
  you do not understand what you are trying to do. Especially, when the
  options are set by yourself, do not install ports that match *xdvi* and
  *dvips* because they break the installed print/teTeX-base's dviware
  and such conflicts will not be detected. In most cases, a combination
  of print/teTeX-base + print/dvipsk-tetex + print/xdvik (which are
  installed by print/teTeX by default) will be sufficient.

  The firefox-0.9 update has a special requirement before you can run it.
  You must first run firefox as root before running it as another user.
  The best way to do this is to su - to root or log
  in as root (i.e. do not su -m to root). After becoming root, simply run
  ``firefox''. You can then quit the browser, then run it as any other

20040404:
  AFFECTS: GNOME desktop users
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.6. Simply portupgrading will cause serious

  user, you should carefully read the instructions at:

	http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html

  And use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to properly upgrade to GNOME 2.6. If

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update

  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR:

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key

    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.

    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter

    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.

    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

  AFFECTS: i386 users of lang/ruby* and sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.
