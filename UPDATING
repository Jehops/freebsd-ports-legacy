This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

20040521:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-hybrid-ru

  UID/GID were changed from 6667 to 555, please manually delete
  old entries from /etc/passwd /etc/master.passwd and /etc/group

20040514:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/faad

  If the compilation of faad fails, please manually delete older
  installed version of faad and reinstall from port.

20040512:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX

  The print/teTeX no longer installs dvipsk by default.  To build and
  install dvipsk, you have to specify WITH_DVIPSK, or the dvipsk utility
  in the print/teTeX is also available print/dvipsk-tetex separately.
  This change is to resolve conflicts between various versions of dvips.

20040504:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/drac

  The "drac_flags" rc.conf(5) variable has been renamed to "dracd_flags".
  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache13

  The apache13 port must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040429:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/smartmontools

  The smartmontools port must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools

  The cdrecord program now uses ${PREFIX}/etc (e.g. /usr/local/etc) instead
  of /etc/default as the location of the global configuration file. If you
  created such a configuration file you need to copy it over to the new
  location.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3

  If you update KDE from version 3.2.1 or earlier to version 3.2.2 while
  running a KDE session, newly opened instances of Konqueror might hang
  or crash, depending on how far the update has progressed.

  If this happens, it is necessary to restart your KDE session in order to
  restore proper operations.

20040404:
  AFFECTS: GNOME desktop users

  GNOME has been updated to 2.6.  Simply portupgrading will cause serious
  problems if you are using the desktop itself.  If you are a GNOME desktop
  user, you should carefully read the instructions at:

  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html

  And use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to properly upgrade to GNOME 2.6.  If
  you are just a casual user of some of the GNOME libraries, portupgrade
  should be sufficient to update your ports.

20040316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/isc-dhcp3-*

  The isc-dhcp3-* ports must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message for details.

20040313:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/expat2

  Users of expat2 (and its many dependencies) should do the following to
  properly update expat2 and all of its dependencies:

  portupgrade -rf textproc/expat2

20040311:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7

  PostgreSQL 7.4.2 Released and release notes available at
  http://www.postgresql.org/news/173.html

  NOTICE: unlike most minor versions, this version does require some
  updates to the pg_* system tables. Full instructions for how to do
  this are included in the full HISTORY file.

  DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3 and x11/kdebase3

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update
  kdebase to version 3.2.1, then restart KDE.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/arts and x11/kdebase

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

20040305:
  AFFECTS: users of security/antivir-milter

  When updating from a previous version of security/antivir-milter you
  have to do the following after deinstalling the old port:
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key
    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.
    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter
    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.
    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of ruby and portupgrade

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.

20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.

  Change the default version of perl to 5.8.

  1) Force perl-5.6.1 to be upgraded with perl-5.8.
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
