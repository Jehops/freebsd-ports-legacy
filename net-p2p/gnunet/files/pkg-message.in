This port requires configuration after installation.  Recommended
practices and configuration information can be found in:

%%DOCSDIR%%/README

and the Installation and User Handbooks at the gnunet website:

https://gnunet.org/book

After consulting these documents, a suitable system-wide configuration
file should be created, by editing:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/gnunet.conf

Also, each user should create a user-specific configuration file (this
must be present, although it can be empty):

mkdir ~/.gnunet
touch ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf

Information on using gnunet with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases can be
found in the README.mysql and README.postgres documents in the doc
subdirectory of the gnunet distfile.
