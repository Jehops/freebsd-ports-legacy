To use bitflu with the plugins installed by this package, configure
your ~/.bitflu.config to search for plugins here (instead of the
default ./plugins):

  %%PLUGINSDIR%%

If you have previously used a version of bitflu prior to 0.4x, you may
want to convert your data to the new storage plugin (which was
introduced along with the upstream bitflu re-write). Such conversions
can be done using fluconvert. If the package is build with
documentation, the upstream instructions for using fluconvert is
installed at:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/fluconvert-README.txt

When installed by this port, the bitflu workdir is located under
~/.bitflu.workdir by default rather than ./bitflu.workdir (you may
want to use --config=./bitflu.workdir to produce the behavior used by
the upstream version).
