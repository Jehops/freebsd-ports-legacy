[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

This is Kenosis-enabled BitTorrent. Using Kenosis, we've eliminated
the tracker as a central point of failure for BitTorrent downloads.
Kenosis-enabled BitTorrent is 100% backwards compatible with existing
BitTorrent clients.

Kenosis-BitTorrent uses torrent files which specify a tracker of
the form http://hash.bt.kenosisp2p.org, where "hash" is the hash
of the original file.

Kenosis-BitTorrent downloaders will notice that this is a kenosis
url and use kenosis to find the tracker that is handling this torrent
file. Standard BitTorrent downloaders try to resolve hash.bt.kenosisp2p.org
as normal. Our dns server will look up the hash in kenosis and
return to the client the ip address of the kenosis node that is
tracking that file. If that tracker becomes unreachable, subsequent
lookups for that hash will switch automatically to the next available
Kenosis-enabled tracker.
