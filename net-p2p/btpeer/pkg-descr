[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

This is a collection of classes implementing the core client
functionality of the bittorrent protocol, in a network only
environment. 'Network only' means that all interaction with the
client core is done via network connections. Loading of metainfo
files are done using a small program for file transfer into the
client core ("inject"), status of the client is shown using a small
internal web page server.
