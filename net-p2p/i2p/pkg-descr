[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

I2P is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that applications
can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other.
The network itself is strictly message based (ala IP), but there
is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication
on top of it (ala TCP). All communication is end to end encrypted
(in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a
message), and even the end points ("destinations") are cryptographic
identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys).
