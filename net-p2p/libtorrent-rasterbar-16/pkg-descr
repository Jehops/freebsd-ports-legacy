libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
other bittorrent implementations around.  It is a library and not a full
featured client.

The main goals of libtorrent are:
	* to be cpu efficient
	* to be memory efficient
	* to be very easy to use

The 0.16 branch adds uTP support.

Note that this is NOT the same library as the libtorrent port!
