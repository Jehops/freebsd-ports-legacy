PySoulSeek is a client for SoulSeek filesharing system. To use it on 
Linux/Unix and X11 you'll need all of the following:

* Gtk+ 1.2
* Python 2.1 or newer
* wxPython 2.3.4 or newer (Gtk port)

If you can run wxPython demos, you may be sure PySoulSeek will run too.

After installing pyslsk (see INSTALL for that), the executable
to run is named 'pyslsk'.

Right-clicking on an item in any list gives you the menu of what's available. 
To search for files just enter your search string into the input box in 
the search tab.

Good luck!  As always, feedback is greatly appreciated, bugreports and
patches even more so.
