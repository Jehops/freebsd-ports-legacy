[ excerpt taken from developer's web site ]

sancho is a gui that connects to a p2p core application. Power users
that use p2p applications usually choose one that has core/gui
separation. sancho provides an easy to use, powerful, and configurable
gui, currently supporting the gui protocol of the popular mldonkey
core.

The sancho project is written for fun, but also to test some new
and exciting technologies. It is written in Java using the SWT
widget toolkit and can be compiled on multiple platforms with the
gcj compiler to native machine code (java=slow and bulky? not
anymore! no external java runtime required!). Windows, Linux, OSX
and other popular operating systems are supported.
