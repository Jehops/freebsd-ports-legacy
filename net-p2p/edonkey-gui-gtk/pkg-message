This port is an attempt to distribute a FreeBSD native version of
the eDonkey GTK GUI written by Tim-Philipp Müller.

It might not work at all. As always, there are no implied guarantees.
You try this at your own risk. Be warned. :-)

If it does not work for you, you can always try the Linux version
of this port available at /usr/ports/net/linux-edonkey-gui-gtk. It
might work.

Currently, this native version is restricted to the following FreeBSD
platforms:

- i386 FreeBSD 4.x-STABLE (post 4.6R Release); OSVERSION=450006
