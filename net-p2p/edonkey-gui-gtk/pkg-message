	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

This port is an attempt to distribute a FreeBSD native version of
the eDonkey GTK GUI written by Tim-Philipp Müller.

It might not work at all. As always, there are no implied guarantees.
You try this at your own risk. Be warned. :-)

If it does not work for you, you can always try the Linux version
of this port available at ${PORTSDIR}/net-p2p/linux-edonkey-gui-gtk. It
might work.

However, before trying the Linux version, try removing old configuration
files. The newer versions of the eDonkey GTK GUI are incompatible
with older configuration files.
