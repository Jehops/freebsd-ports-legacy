NapShare is a GUI based Gnutella Client.

It's a fully featured Gnutella Client designed to share any type of
file the user wishes to share. Take a nap while it does the work! When
finished, you will supply a list of keywords and filters then it will
download overnight, automatically, also sharing whatever it gets.
