Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a tool designed to ease the distribution
of very large files over the internet, for example CD or DVD images. Its aim
is to make downloading the images as easy for users as a click on a direct
download link in a browser, while avoiding all the problems that server
administrators have with hosting such large files.

At the moment this port is only tested to work for building the iso images
of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
