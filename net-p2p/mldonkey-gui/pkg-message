	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

- It is not a bad idea to install mplayer. You will be able
  to preview half-downloaded files (if you have the beginning).

- Please make sure that you read
  /usr/local/share/doc/mldonkey/Readme.txt.
  It contains important information about how to run mldonkey. 

- If this is the first time you install mldonkey,
  please go to the mldonkey ports dir as a user and enter:

     make install-user

  this will set up your user config and install an 
  initial server list.

- You can import the downloads started with eDonkey
  (try "import /home/directory/path/.edonkey2000-core"
  on the console), but you can NOT go back!
