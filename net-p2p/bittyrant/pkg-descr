BitTyrant is a new, protocol compatible BitTorrent client that is optimized
for fast download performance. BitTyrant is:

* Fast: During evaluation testing on more than 100 real BitTorrent swarms,
  BitTyrant provided an average 70% download performance increase when
  compared to the existing Azureus 2.5 implementation, with some downloads
  finishing more than three times as quickly.

* Fair: BitTorrent was designed with incentives in mind: if a user is
  downloading at 30 KBps, they should upload at 30 KBps. However, due to the
  unique workload properties of many real-world swarms, this is not always
  enforced. BitTyrant is designed to make efficient use of your scarce upload
  bandwidth, rewarding those users whose upload allocations are fair and only
  allocating excess capacity to other users.

* Familiar: BitTyrant is based on modifications to Azureus 2.5, currently the
  most popular BitTorrent client. All of our changes are under the hood.
  You'll find the GUI identical to Azureus, with optional additions to display
  statistics relevant to BitTyrant's operation.
