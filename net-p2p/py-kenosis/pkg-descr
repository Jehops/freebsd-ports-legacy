[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Kenosis is a fully-distributed p2p RPC system built on top of
XMLRPC. Nodes are automatically connected to each other via a
Kademlia-style network (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/529075.html) and
can route RPC requests efficiently to any online node. Kenosis does
not rely on a central server - any Kenosis node can effectively join
the network ("bootstrap") from any connected node.
