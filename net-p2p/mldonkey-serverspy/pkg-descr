[ excerpt from developer's www site]
MLDonkey Server Spy is an application for MLDonkey that broadcasts
your whereabouts on the edonkey network.

It will detect the server that you are connected to, and place this
information on an image. The image is then uploaded to a Web server
using FTP. It can then be used on Web pages, message boards etc.

In this way others will be able to see where you are located and
will then be able to connect to the same edonkey server, making it
easier to get the files that you are sharing. The application updates
the image frequently so that the latest information is always shown.
