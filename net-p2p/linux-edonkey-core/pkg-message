Please make sure that you read
%%DOCSDIR%%/README.FreeBSD.
It contains important information about both configuring and running
edonkey2000 under FreeBSD. You will have problems running it if you
do not read it.

eDonkey2000 version 0.46 and later store downloads in a different
format. Therefore, they are not compatible with either lmule or
older eDonkey2000 clients.

eDonkey2000 version 1.0.2 requires edonkey-gui-gtk version 0.6.3 or higher.
Older gui versions will not work with this version. Also the standard directory
in which eDonkey2000 stores the user settings has been changed from
~/.edonkey2000-core to ~/.eDonkey2000. That's why eDonkey2000 will NOT
recognise your settings and downloads until you rename the old directory.

Finally, this port doesn't come with a wrapper anymore, because eDonkey2000
keeps user settings in a directory that is hardcoded into the executable.
