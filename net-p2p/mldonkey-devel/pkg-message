	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

- If you want to know how to use mldonkey, read "Readme.txt" or
  "FAQ.html" in the port docs (/usr/local/share/doc/mldonkey)

- It is not a bad idea to install mplayer. You will be able
  to preview half-downloaded files (if you have the beginning).

- Please make sure that you read
  /usr/local/share/doc/mldonkey/Readme.txt.
  It contains important information about how to run mldonkey. 

- You can import the downloads you started with eDonkey
  (try "import /home/directory/path/.edonkey2000-core"
  on the console), but you can NOT go back!
