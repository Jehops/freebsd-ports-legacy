The Overnet 'core' is the actual Overnet program which does
everything behind the scenes - connecting to peers, searching,
downloading, uploading, all that stuff. It is the serverless
equivalent to eDonkey2000.

The 'core' comes with a very simple text interface (=command line
client), where you can tell it what to do by typing in commands.
