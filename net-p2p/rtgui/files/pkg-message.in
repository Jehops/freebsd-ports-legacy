To make rtgui available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

SCGIMount /RPC2 127.0.0.1:5000

    Alias /rtgui/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/">
        Options none
        AllowOverride Limit
        Order Deny,Allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

with in .rtorrent.rc:
scgi_port = localhost:5000

or in your lighttpd:
scgi.server = (
                "/RPC2" =>
                  ( "127.0.0.1" =>
                    (
                      "socket" => "/home/user/rtorrent/rpc.socket",
                      "check-local" => "disable",
                      "disable-time" => 0,  # don't disable scgi if connection fails
                    )
                  )
              )
with .rtorrent.rc:
scgi_local = /home/user/rtorrent/rpc.socket

Security considerations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely no thought whatsoever has been given to security in rtGui -
do not run this on a publicly available website. rtGui is intended for
'home' use where users can be considered as trusted. A basic
authentication mechanism is planned for future releases. At the very
least, you should password protect your webserver using .htaccess or
similar (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess for more info).
