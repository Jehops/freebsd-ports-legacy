FreeBSD TorrentFlux installation

  $FreeBSD$

These are the steps to install TorrentFlux with LightTPD, SQLite and eAccelerator.
Some manual configuration is necessary, but it should be fairly easy to get the
port up and running.

1. install port www/php5-cgi
   - Check "Enable fastcgi support"

2. copy %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/php.ini-recommended to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/php.ini
   - Comment the line
         error_reporting  =  E_ALL
     and uncomment
         error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

3. (optional) install databases/sqlite2 with NOPORTDOCS=yes
   - this port is pulled in either ways, but you may want to avoid installing
     TCL as a build dependency

4. install port net-p2p/torrentflux with WITH_TF_DATADIR=/your/download/directory
   - The directory must be writable by the 'www' user and reside on a
     partition with enough free space to accommodate all files you plan
     to download. It will be created if it doesn't exist.

     (hint) you can put it on an encrypted partition:
       http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/disks-encrypting.html

   - (optional) edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/tfconfig.php:
     depredating on your network configuration, you might want to change
     "minport", "maxport" and "cmd_options"

     (note) when you want to utilize port net/trickle to throttle the total bandwidth,
     do something like
       $cfg["btphpbin"] = "%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/trickle -parameters %%PREFIX%%/libexec/btphptornado.py";

5. install port www/lighttpd
   - copy %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/lighttpd.conf.sample to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/lighttpd.conf
   - edit %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/lighttpd.conf:
     enable "mod_fastcgi"
     uncomment the "fastcgi.server" section
   - add lighttpd_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf

7. install port www/eaccelerator
   - add the line
       extension=eaccelerator.so
     to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/php/extensions.ini

8. create an administrator account:
   - run lighttpd:
       %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/lighttpd.sh start
   - Open http://127.0.0.1/tf/login.php in a browser
     The first user to log in is automatically declared administrator

To Do:
  - add instructions how to run the port with mod_php5 and apache
