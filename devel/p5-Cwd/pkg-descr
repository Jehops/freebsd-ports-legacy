Cwd - get pathname of current working directory

This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the current
working directory. It is recommended that getcwd (or another *cwd() function)
be used in all code to ensure portability.

By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.
