GNU binutils for cross-target application development.

Prerequisite for the GCC cross-compiling enviropment.

Use TGTARCH switch to select target architecture, and TGTABI to select ABI.
E.g. the following command will build binutils for rtems on sparc:
% make TGTARCH=sparc TGTABI=rtems

If you encounter any problems building/using/installing this port, please
make me know. It would help to improve this port in feature.
