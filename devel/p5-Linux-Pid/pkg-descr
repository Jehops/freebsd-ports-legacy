Why should one use a module to get the PID and the PPID of a process
where there are the $$ variable and the getppid() builtin? (Not
mentioning the equivalent POSIX::getpid() and POSIX::getppid()
functions.)

In fact, this is useful on Linux, with multithreaded programs. Linux'
C library, using the linux thread model, returns different values of
the PID and the PPID from different threads. (Other thread models such
as NPTL don't have the same behaviour). This module forces perl to
call the underlying C functions getpid() and getppid().
