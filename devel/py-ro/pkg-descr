Pyro is an acronym for PYthon Remote Objects. It is a basic Distributed
Object Technology system written entirely in Python, and for use in Python
only. With this, it closely resembles Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
It has less similarity to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent
Distributed Object Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI.
But Pyro is small, simple and free!
