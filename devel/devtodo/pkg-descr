devtodo is a program to assist developers (or anybody who uses a
terminal) in maintaining a list of outstanding tasks in a heirarchical,
prioritised, list. Additionally, it can automatically list outstanding
items when you change into a directory (see example shell configurations
in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/devtodo).
