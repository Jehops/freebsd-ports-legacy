  Bugzilla has now been installed.  To get it up and running you have to:

  1. Create bugs database at your MySQL server.
  2. Run ${PREFIX}/www/data.default/checksetup.pl to create configuration
     file (you need to do it at installation time only)
  3. Edit newly created ${PREFIX}/www/data.default/localconfig file
     to customize Bugzilla setup for your system
  4. Run ${PREFIX}/www/data.default/checksetup.pl again to create required
     Bugzilla data directories and fix files permissions.

  For more complete instructions on installation, setup and security notes
  read Bugzilla Guide in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/bugzilla (chapter 3: Installation)
