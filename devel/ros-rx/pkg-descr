Robot Operating System (ROS) is a meta-operating system for your robot.
It provides several services for a robot control system, including but
not limited to:
* language-independent and network-transparent communication
* including hardware abstraction
* low-level device control
* implementation of commonly-used functionality
* message-passing between processes

This port provides the core part of ROS: the base system and the tools
to develop additional nodes. These additional nodes can be installed
manually by using something like:
% svn co `roslocate svn nodename` nodename
  (or git clone `roslocate svn nodename` nodename)
% rosmake nodename
