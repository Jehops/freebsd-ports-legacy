RadRails is an integrated development environment for the
Ruby on Rails framework.
The goal of this project is to provide Rails developers
with everything they need to develop, manage,
test and deploy their applications.
Features include source control, debugging, WEBrick servers,
generator wizards, syntax highlighting, data tools and much much more.
The RadRails IDE is built on the Eclipse RCP, and includes the
Subclipse plug-in and the RDT plug-ins.
The RadRails tools are also available as Eclipse plug-ins.
