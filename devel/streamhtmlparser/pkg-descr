Implementation of an html and javascript context scanner with no
lookahead. Its purpose is to scan an html document and provide context
information at any point within the input stream. An example of a user
of this scanner would be an auto escaping templating system, which would
require html context information at very specific points within the html
stream. The implementation is based on a simplified state machine of
HTML4.1 and javascript. The code also contains C++ and python bindings.
