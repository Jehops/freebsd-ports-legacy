GuiLoader is a high-performance and compact GuiXml loader library.
This library allows GTK+ applications to create GUI widgets and
objects at run-time from GuiXml resource files. GuiLoader is
written in the C language as a GObject subclass and has
a trivial language-independent API. GuiLoader was designed to be
easily wrapped for any language that has GTK+ bindings.
