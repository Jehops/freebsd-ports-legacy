CScout is a source code analyzer and refactoring browser for
collections of C programs.  It can process workspaces of multiple
projects (we define a project as a collection of C source files
that are linked together) mapping the complexity introduced by the
C preprocessor back into the original C source code files.  CScout
takes advantage of modern hardware advances (fast processors and
large memory capacities) to analyze C source code beyond the level
of detail and accuracy provided by  current compilers and linkers.
The analysis CScout performs takes into account the identifier
scopes introduced by the C preprocessor and the C language proper
scopes and namespaces.  CScout has already been applied on projects
ranging from tens of thousands of lines, like the apache web server
(using 36MB of memory, taking 6 minutes on a 500MHz Celeron processor),
to above a million lines of code, like the FreeBSD kernel (using
813MB of memory, taking 3 hours 42 minutes on a 900MHz Itanium 2
processor).
