This is the perl5 TimeDate distribution. It requires perl version 5.003
or later

This distribution replaces my earlier GetDate distribution, which was
only a date parser. The date parser contained in this distribution
is far superior to the yacc based parser, and a *lot* fatser.

The parser contained here will only parse absolute dates, if you want a date
parser that can parse relative dates then take a look at the
Time modules by David Muir on CPAN.

The file Local.pm.new which is included in this distribution is a patched 
version of Time::Local which comes with perl. It fixes two problems

    - It determines the zone offset based on now rather than epoch
    - It fixes a problem with looping forever when a year > 1900 is passed in
