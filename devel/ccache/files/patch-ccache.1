+This tells ccache to not hash the real compiler's size and modification
+time. Normally this is the mechanism to detect compiler upgrades.
+There are situations however, where even though the compiler's size or
+modification time has changed you can safely use the cached objects
+(e.g. if as part of your build system the compiler is built as well
+and the compiler's source has not changed; or if the compiler has only
+changes that do not affect code generation). Use this feature only if
+you know what you are doing.
