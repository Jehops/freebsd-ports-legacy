To use ccache add the following to /etc/make.conf

.if !defined(NOCCACHE)
CC=%%PREFIX%%/%%CCLINKDIR%%cc
CXX=%%PREFIX%%/%%CCLINKDIR%%c++
.endif

If you have a problem building a port
define NOCCACHE and try again.

To use ccache with ports that use USE_GCC
add %%PREFIX%%/%%CCLINKDIR%% to your PATH
and make sure it is before %%LOCALBASE%%/bin

Ccache has installed links for the following compilers
%%CCACHE_COMPILERS%%
in %%PREFIX%%/%%CCLINKDIR%%

Please make sure you have the compiler installed before you do this or your
build will fail because it will not be able to find the compiler.
