The goal of LibGII is to provide a single easy to use, but yet powerful, API
for all possible input sources.  However we are not there yet.  The API is far
from set in stone yet, and is likely to change.

The main purpose of this LibGII release is to accompany our LibGGI beta
release, but you're still very welcome to use LibGII as a standalone library
for your non-LibGGI applications.
