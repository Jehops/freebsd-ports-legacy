       The Devel::DProf package is a Perl code profiler.  This
       will collect information on the execution time of a Perl
       script and of the subs in that script.  This information
       can be used to determine which subroutines are using the
       most time and which subroutines are being called most
       often.  This information can also be used to create an
       execution graph of the script, showing subroutine
       relationships.
