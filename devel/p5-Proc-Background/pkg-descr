This is the Proc::Generic package.  It provides a generic interface to
running background processes.  Through this interface, users can run
background processes on different operating systems without concerning
themselves about the specifics of doing this.  Users of this package
create new Proc::Generic objects that provide an object oriented
interface to process management.
