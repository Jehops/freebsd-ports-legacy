The portcheckout(1) reads the /usr/ports/INDEX file and checks-out
a given port and its dependencies.  This makes it easy to use the
ports system without having a full and up-to-date /usr/ports tree.

A typical use would be to connect to the Internet, possibly download
a new INDEX and ports upgrade kit, download a port skeleton with
portcheckout(1), and then build the port.
