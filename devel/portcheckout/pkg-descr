NAME
        portcheckout - checkout ports and all depending ports

SYNOPSIS
        portcheckout ports [...]

DESCRIPTION
    Portcheckout(1) checks out a FreeBSD port and all runtime and buildtime
    depending ports into the current working directory. The output is
    written to stdout as an executable shell-script.

    Compiling a FreeBSD usually require a full tree of ports in /usr/port. A
    cvs checkout or a cvs update command takes a very long time and need
    much free space.

    With portcheckout, you checkout only the parts of the port tree which
    you really need. This is a magnitude faster!

FILES
    Portcheckout depend on a an up to date INDEX file in /usr/ports/INDEX.

EXAMPLE
      $ portcheckout gnuplot

      cd /tmp || exit 1
      PORTSDIR="/tmp/ports"; export PORTSDIR
       
      # checkout ports
      # gnuplot-340
      cvs co ports/math/gnuplot
       
      # checkout depencies
      # png-1.0.2
      cvs co ports/graphics/png
      # gd-1.3
      cvs co ports/graphics/gd
       
      # Compile and install gnuplot-340
      (cd ports/math/gnuplot && make all install clean)
