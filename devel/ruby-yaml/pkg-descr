"YAML(tm) (rhymes with 'camel') is a
straightforward machine parsable data serialization format designed for
human readability and interaction with scripting languages such as Perl
and Python. YAML is optimized for data serialization, formatted
dumping, configuration files, log files, Internet messaging and
filtering. This specification describes the YAML information model and
serialization format. Together with the Unicode standard for characters, it
provides all the information necessary to understand YAML Version 1.0
and construct computer programs to process it."

For Ruby developers, YAML is a natural fit for object serialization and
general data storage.  Really, it's quite fantastic.  Spreads right on
your Rubyware like butter on bread!

The possible uses for YAML are innumerable.  Configuration files,
custom internet protocols, documentation, the list goes on and on.
Also, with YAML readers popping up for other languages (see YAML.pm
and others), you can pass data easily to colleagues in distant lands,
swamped in their archaic languages.
