Perf Tools is a collection of a high-performance multi-threaded malloc()
implementation, plus some pretty nifty performance analysis tools.
Perf Tools is the fastest memory allocation library available,
it also often allows applications to have smaller memory
footprint.

Multithreaded support is not yet ported to FreeBSD but many programs can
benefit from performance improvement of memory allocation.
