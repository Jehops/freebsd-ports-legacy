A binary serialization library, similar to binary, that introduces an
isolate primitive for parser isolation, and replaces the asynchronous
errors with a user-handleable Either type. Similar to binary in
performance, but uses a strict ByteString instead of a lazy
ByteString, thus restricting it to operating on finite inputs.
