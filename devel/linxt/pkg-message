Users of linxt must have write permissions on the USB devices associated
with the NXT brick (e.g. dev/usb0* and dev/ugen0*).  Using chmod will
only affect these devices until they are detached.  See etc/devfs.rules
and etc/usbd.conf (also "man devfs.rules" and "man usbd.conf") for
controlling USB device permissions when they are attached.
