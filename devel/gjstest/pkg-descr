Google JS Test is a fast javascript unit testing framework that runs on the V8
engine, without needing to launch a full browser.

Features include:
- Extremely fast test startup and execution time, without having to run a
  browser.
- Clean, readable output in the case of both passing and failing tests.
- A browser-based test driver that can simply be refreshed whenever JS is
  changed.
- Style and semantics that resemble Google Test for C++.
- A built-in mocking framework that requires minimal boilerplate code (e.g. no
  $tearDown or $verifyAll) with style and semantics based on the Google C++
  Mocking Framework.

The trade-off is that since tests are run in V8 without a browser, there is no
DOM available. You can still use Google JS Test for tests of DOM-manipulating
code however; see "Is it for me?" [1] for more details.
