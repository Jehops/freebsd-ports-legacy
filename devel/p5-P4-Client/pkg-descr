This module provides a Perl interface to the Perforce API allowing you
to write Perl scripts which communicate directly with a Perforce server.

P4::Client is the main interface through which all commands are issued.
The Perforce API is callback based though, and all interaction with the
user interface takes place through callbacks to methods of the P4::UI
object passed to the Run() method.

To customise the behaviour of the Perforce client, you should derive
your own class from P4::UI and override the relevant methods therein.
