INTRO
=====

I needed a basic text-mode GUI framework to implement some
nice-looking proggies on Linux. Didn't find any around, so necessity
became the mother of PerlVision. And this beast kept growing as I made
love to Perl, so now it's far from 'basic'. Provides 90% of the
features you'd want for a user interface, including checkboxes,
radiobuttons, three different styles (!) of pushbuttons, single and
multiple selection listboxes, an extensible editbox that does
autowrapping, a scrollable viewbox, single line text entry fields, a
menubar with pulldown menus, and full popup dialog boxes with multiple
controls.

This version of PerlVision uses Will Setzer's Curses.pm dynaload
module for Perl, so you need to get and compile that first, from
ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/cursperl<whatever>.

PerlVision will only work with Perl 5+ of-course (upgrade || die()!).
