  It is gcc (c, c++ and objc compiler suite) for  MIPS Little Endian Linux
  (mipsel-linux) target with vr-linux pathces.
  This target is, for example, VR Linux on NEC's VR-based PDAs (Agenda VR3
  and others).
  This port doesn't contains any libraries or headers. To build it you must
  have headers for your target in ${PREFIX}/mipsel-linux/include directory.
  Headers and libraries for VR Linux could be found at VR Linux homepage
  in form of RedHat RPM's.
  Headers and libraries for Agenda VR6 PDA could be installed from
  devel/agenda-headers and devel/agenda-libs ports.
