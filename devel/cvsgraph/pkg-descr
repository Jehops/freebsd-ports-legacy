This program generates a graph (in PNG format) showing the revisions,
tags, and branching of a file in a CVS or RCS repository.  Example:

cvsgraph -r /home/ncvs -m ports/devel/cvsgraph -o test.png pkg-descr,v

It can also be used with cvsweb.

The sorting is buggy:  revision 1.2 appears between 1.19 and 1.20,
for instance.
