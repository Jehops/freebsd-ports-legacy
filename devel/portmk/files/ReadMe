This is port devel/portmk, an alternate bsd.port.mk.

Targets of this project are:

- Modularization on bsd.port.mk, to make refactoring possible.

- Better awareness of upcoming features for ports developers,
  including giving them the ability to review changes and give
  feedback early.

- Faster turnaround times for development patches.

- Widespread testing of new features.

- Faster adoption of advanced features without endangering the
  stability of the ports tree.

This has been created as a follow-up to a proposal I sent to
portmgr@ May 13th.

Although it is desired that the whole ports tree builds with
portmk, it is inevitable to break some ports. This may be due
to bugs in portmk, where not every change is bento-tested before
committed, or ports depending on undocumented features they
shouldn't rely upon.

How can you help?

- Build your ports with portmk, falling back to omake only when
  necessary. Submit entries to KnownIssues in case of problems.

- Run a tinderbox with portmk 

- Submit patches improving the code

- Give feedback whether you like the new features, and what do
  you think could be improved.

Other available documentation:

- Features: a list of features in portmk that are not in bsd.port.mk

- ChangeLog: History of mayor feature additions / removals

- KnownIssues: ports known to malfunction with portmk
