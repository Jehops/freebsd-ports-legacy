In case you need to fall back to the old routines, just build the port with `omake'.


* completely rewritten do-fetch/checksum/makesum/fetch-list targets:

- sort MASTER_SITES by distance or latency

To fetch from the nearest mirrors first, install port net/p5-Geo-IP and put

MASTER_SORT_GEOIP=yes
CC_HOME=eu

in /etc/portmk.conf. The first time fetching may stall for about ten seconds, since all sites must be looked up first. Subsequent fetches should be *much* faster.


To fetch from the side with the smallest measured latency, install perl and port net/fping and add

MASTER_SORT_FPING=yes

to /etc/portmk.conf

- refetch from multiple mirrors in case of a checksum mismatch (up to FETCH_REGET times)

Instead of trying the same mirror (which might have a corrupt distfile) twice.

- randomize MASTER_SITES by default (disable with KEEP_MASTER_SITE_ORDER)

- new targets `missing-size' and `missing-recursive-size':  calculate size of missing distribution files


Type
  make missing-recursive-size
to check how many files you have to fetch to build the current port. To check how many files a port with subports needs overall, including files already on your local disk, do

  make DISTDIR=/nonexistent missing-recursive-size

- new target checkdistsites, a brute-force distfile survery for home use,
  use with NO_CHECKSUM to just verify the sizes without downloading the files

NO_CHECKSUM currently works only with fetch, not wget or curl. Try

  make NO_CHECKSUM=yes checkdistsites

to verify whether your distfiles are fetchable from every site.

- support for integrating distinfo into the ports Makefile via `migratesum' (experimental,
  multiple integrated distinfo files could be distinguised by DISTINFO_LABEL)


- support for SHA1 and RMD160 checksums

- support for MASTER_SITES that don't end with a slash

- support to substitute %FILE% in MASTER_SITES with the distfiles name


Useful for sites that have ...?file=xxx&download=true or cvsweb style download sites

- fetch with curl or wget with FETCH_USE_CURL and FETCH_USE_WGET (requires installed curl or wget)


For people behind firewalls that need the extended capabilities. Be aware that some extra features (like size checking) are currently not availible with those download clients.

* next generation options handling (work in progress)

- only prototype functionality is available

- saved configuration affects clean, describe etc.

- the port is build with the correct default options when not configured

- honours options given on the command line, so that portupgrade et al still work

- custom configurations are available before bsd.port.pre.mk is included

- completely unintrusive, a port doesn't need to be configured when the defaults are acceptable

* ability to build packages without the need to install a port (work in progress)

- not available yet
