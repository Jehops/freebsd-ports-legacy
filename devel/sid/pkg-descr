Sid is a LL(1) parser generator that turns specifications of languages into
programs that recognise those languages. One of the aims of sid was to separate
the specification of the language to be recognised from the language that the
recogniser program is written in. For this reason, input to sid is split into
two components: output language independent information, and output language
dependent information.
