Uppaal is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation
and verification of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed
automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.).

The tool is developed in collaboration between the Department of
Information Technology at Uppsala University, Sweden and the
Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University in Denmark.
