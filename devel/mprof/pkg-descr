from the README:

MPROF -- memory profiler (version 3.0)

To use mprof, you must link the library libc_mp.a (found in the mprof
directory) into your application (this library is the C library with
the definitions of malloc and free replaced).  Profiling starts
automatically when malloc is first called.  Profile data is written to
the file "mprof.data".  There are several functions that users can
call to change the name of the output file, etc.  See the man page in
mprof.man.

Simply by linking in the new malloc and executing your application, a
file called ``mprof.data'' will be created in the current directory.
This is the data file that mprof uses to build its dynamic call graph.
[...]
Mprof does not use Kyoto Common Lisp anymore.  To use mprof, all you
need is a C compiler.
