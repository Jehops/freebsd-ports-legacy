C->Haskell assists in the development of Haskell bindings to C libraries.
It extracts interface information from C header files and generates Haskell
code with foreign imports and marshaling. Unlike writing foreign imports
by hand (or using hsch2s), this ensures that C functions are imported with
the correct Haskell types.
