This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.

This package provides the fixed version of libtool that works on FreeBSD 10.0
and allows building autoconfed packages with support for FreeBSD 10.0.
