Lock files are used on Unix-like systems as a means of synchronization among
processes. Only one process can hold a lock file. Other processes that want to
acquire it have to wait until it is released by the holder.

In this module the lock file is implemented as an empty regular file,
exclusively locked using fcntl.flock. The file is removed when it is to be
released.
