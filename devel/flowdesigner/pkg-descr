FlowDesigner is a free (GPL) "data flow oriented" development environment. It
works by visually connecting basic nodes into a network in order to create
complex applications.  It can be used as a rapid development tool, but also in
real-time applications. The design has been done in C++ and allows toolkits
to be easily added.
