Included is the basic C++ compiler, although this is only of limited
use without a libstdc++, and it is little tested.

Supported debugging formats: -gdwarf-2 [default], -gstabs
Locally hack added: recognizes 0bXXX binary constants

Locally added support for the following AVR devices:

  ATtiny43U
  ATtiny48
  AT90PWM2B/PWM3B
  AT90PWM216/PWM316
  ATmega48P/88P/168P/328P
  ATmega2560/ATmega2561
