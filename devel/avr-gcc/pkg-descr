FSF gcc-3.x for Atmel AVR cross-development

This brings the gcc compiler to the Atmel AVR 8-bit RISC family of
microcontrollers.

Included is the basic C++ compiler, although this is only of limited
use without a libstdc++, and it is little tested.

Supported debugging formats: -gstabs [default] and -gdwarf-2
Locally hack added: recognizes 0bXXX binary constants
