This port is a shell for building the m68kgdb, m68kbinutils, m68kgcc and
m68knewlib ports in the proper sequence. Compilers for C and C++ are 
generated; Objective-C is not currently supported.

The previous port used Cygnus's crosstree script and patches.  This version
does not, since they have not released these items for more recent versions
of the binutils, gcc, and newlib releases.  The compiler, debugger, and 
binutils are stock GNU items, with newlib from Cygnus. 

The new versions provide many desirable features and add support for other
processors as well, which we needed for our own work.  It has been tested
with production code on one project, written in C.  The C++ compiler has
been lightly tested on one trivial program. Feedback please!

The release versions installed are:
	 gdb-4.17, binutils-2.9.2, gcc-2.8.1, newlib-1.8.1

This port is considered a development version, since some people are still
using the 2.7.2.3 based crossm68k.
