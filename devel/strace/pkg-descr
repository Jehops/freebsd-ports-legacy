Strace is a process tracer, i.e. a debugging tool that prints out
a trace of all the system calls made and signals received by a
process itself or a process and its descendants.

Strace is similar to the native BSD ktrace/kdump pair of utilities,
but strace's output style is more convenient in some cases or for
some developers.
