The UDS (Useful Development Stuff) Collection is a C++ library that
assists you while developing and debugging programs. It was developed
as part of Frost. Features were only added when needed, but it
provides already a nice bunch of features. 

Features: 
   - Automatic search for memory leaks 
   - Logging of memory [de]allocations 
   - Zombie objects 
   - Exception system for (almost) fatal errors. A core can be dumped
     when the exception is thrown. 
   - Action, FinalAction, and VRemember 
   - Function objects that are more flexible than STL function objects 
   - Threads, Mutexes, Semaphores Posix Threads wrapper classes 
   - Socket Stream class 
   - ProcStream class (new) 
   - Classes for reference counting that make it easy to implement
     copy-on-write and garbage collection. 
   - Simple pseudo-random number generators 
   - Several "convenience functions" to create temporary file names;
     open files, fork, wait etc. and throw an exception if something goes wrong
