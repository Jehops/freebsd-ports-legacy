This module allows you to delay the computation of values, usually so you 
can change your mind about the returned value. Its a sort of time travel.

The values returned by this module are overloaded objects which can be 
operated on like numbers, strings, or booleans but aren't actually made 
"real" until you use them in some context that requires that they be 
computed first.

As an aide to debugging and to prevent time paradoxes, the default 
postpone() function's effect is that once a value has been computed, it 
ceases to be overloaded and all of the input variables to it are turned 
read only.
