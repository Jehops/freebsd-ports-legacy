Safe C String Library v0.9.6 (June 11, 2003)

The goal of the SafeStr library is to provide a rich string-handling library
for C that has safe semantics yet interoperates with legacy library code in
a straightforward manner. Additionally, porting code that uses standard C
string handling should be straightforward. The library should work on all
modern Unix-like platforms, as well as any 32-bit Microsoft Windows OS.

The overt security goals of the library are as follows:

   1. Buffer overflows should not be possible when using the API.
   2. Format string problems should be impossible when using the API.
   3. The API should be capable of tracking whether strings are "trusted",
      a la Perl's taint mode.

The API is meant to provide rich functionality and be easy to use, all the while
improving security.
