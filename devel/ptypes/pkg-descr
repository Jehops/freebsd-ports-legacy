PTypes (C++ Portable Types Library) is a simple alternative to the STL that
includes multithreading and networking. It defines dynamic strings, character
sets, lists, and other basic data types along with threads, synchronization
and IP sockets. PTypes also offers message queues as an alternative method of
thread synchronization. Its main `target audience' is developers of complex
network daemons, robots or non-visual client/server applications of any kind.

PTypes defines simple and intuitive interfaces. It is portable across many
modern operating systems (Currently FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X and
Windows). All platform-dependent issues are hidden inside. A simple web server
called wshare is now included in the package to demonstrate the full power of
PTypes.
