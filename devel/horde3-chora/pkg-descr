Chora is the Horde CVS viewer; it provides an advanced web-based view of
any local CVS repository. It now includes annotation support, visual
branch viewing capability, and human-readable diffs.

Other features are:

- Support for multiple CVS repositories
- MIME-awareness, to pretty-print code or convert PDFs to text
- Visual branch histories, to view the flow of code through a project
- Internationalisation, with several languages supported
- Annotation (or 'blame') support

... as well as all the usual CVS functions you are familiar with from
other similar applications.
