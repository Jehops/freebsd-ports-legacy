Software updater tool for WorldForge applications.
WFUT allows the automatic updating of "channels" which are available on a
server. The channels are specified by an XML file (which also has an XSL file
associated with it for viewing in a web browser). Each channel has an
associated XML document listing the files available in the channel and the
current version number.WFUT compares this file list with a similar file on the
local machine to determine what files need updating.
WFUT performs a CRC32 check on each file downloaded before overwriting any
existing ones. WFUT keeps a list of files downloaded in a temporary file (which
will not be completely valid XML due to missing end tag) in something happens
during an update which does not allow the local list to be saved.
