c2lib is a library of basic tools for use by C programmers.
It contains a pool allocator, many string functions, STL-like
vector and hash types and miscellaneous utilities.

Its features were heavily influenced by both Perl's string handling
and C++'s Standard Template Library (STL). The library has been designed
to be very easy to use and is fully documented in manual pages.
