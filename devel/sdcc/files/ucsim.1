.TH UCSIM 1 
.SH NAME
s51, savr, sz80 \- 8051, AVR and Z80 microcontrollers simulator for SDCC. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B s51
.I "[options] filenames"
.br
.B savr
.I "[options] filenames"
.br
.B sz80
.I "[options] filenames"
.SH WARNING
The information in this man page is an extract from the full
documentation of 
.B SDCC\c
\&, and is limited to the meaning of the options.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ucSim\c
\& is a microcontroller simulator. It is extensible to support
different microcontroller families. 
.PP
.B MCS51\c
\& family is simulated by
.B s51\c
\&.
.br
.B AVR\c
\& family is simulated by
.B savr\c
\&.
.br
.B Z80\c
\& processor is simulated by
.B sz80\c
\&.
.PP
Specified files must be names of Intel hex files. Simulator loads them in 
specified order into the ROM of the simulated system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-t " "CPU"
Type of CPU. Recognized types are: 51, 8051, 8751, C51, 80C51, 87C51, 31, 8031,
C31, 80C31, 52, 8052, 8752, C52, 80C52, 87C52, 32, 8032, C32, 80C32, 51R, 51RA,
51RB, 51RC, C51R, C51RA, C51RB, C51RC, 89C51R, 251, C251, DS390, DS390F. Note 
that recongition of a CPU type as option does not mean that the simulator can 
simulate that kind of CPU. Default type is C51. DS390 supports Dallas DS80C390 
dual-dptr operations, DS390F supports minimal flat24 mode code and dual-dptr 
operations.
.TP
.BI "\-X " "freq[k|M]"
XTAL frequency is 
.I freq\c
\& Hertz. 
.B k\c
\& or
.B M\c
\& can be used to specify frequency in kHZ or MHz. Space is not allowed between
the number and the 
.B k\c
\& or
.B M\c
\&. Default value is 11059200 Hz. 
.TP
.BI "\-c " "file"
Open command console on 
.I file\c
\&. Command consoles are on standard input and output
by default. Using this option the console can be opened on any file for example
on the serial interface of the computer. 
.TP
.BI "\-Z " "portnum"
Listen for incoming connections on port 
.I portnum\c
\&. Using this option uCsim can 
serve multiple consoles. You can get a console by simply telnet into machine 
running 
.B uCsim\c
\&to port 
.I portnumber\c
\&. This option is not available on platforms which doesn't support BSD 
networking.
.TP
.BI "\-s " "file"
Connect serial interface of the simulated microcontroller to the 
.I file\c
\&. Nothing is used by default which means that characters transmitted by 
serial interface of the simulated microcontroller go to nowhere and it will 
never receive anything. If you are going to communicate with serial interface 
interactively the best idea is to specify a teminal with 
.B -s\c
\& option.
.TP
.BI "-S " "in=file,out=file"
Using this option you can specify different files for input and output streams 
that 
.B uCsim\c
\& uses to simulate microprocessor's serial interface.
.TP
.BI "\-p prompt"
Using this option you can specify any string to be the prompt of command 
interpreter, for example:
.nf
$ s51 -p "s51> "

s51> 
.fi
.TP
.BI "\-P"
Prompt will be a null ('\\0') character. This feature can be useful for 
programs which controlls simulator through a pipe. 
.TP
.BI "\-V"
Verbose mode. The simulator notifies you about some kind of internal actions 
for example interrupts. Messages are printed on command console. 
.TP
.BI "\-v"
Print out version number and stop. 
.TP
.BI "\-H"
Print out types of known CPUs. Names printed out by this option can be used to 
determine CPU type using -t option. 
.TP
.BI "\-h"
Print out a short help about the options and stop.
