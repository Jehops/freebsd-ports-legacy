.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B sdcdb\c
\& is a source debugger for 
.B SDCC\c
\&. It uses 
.B ucSim\c
\& to execute the program, the programm execution is controlled
by the debugger. 
.PP
The command interface for the debugger has been deliberately kept as close the 
GNU debugger gdb, as possible. This will help the integration with existing 
graphical user interfaces (like ddd, xxgdb or xemacs) existing for the GNU 
debugger.
.SH STARTING THE DEBUGGER
The debugger can be started using the following command line (Assume the file 
you are debugging has the file name foo):
.PP
.B sdcdb foo
.PP
The debugger will look for the following files:
.PP
.nf
foo.c   - the source file.
foo.cdb - the debugger symbol information file.
foo.ihx - the intel hex format object file.
.fi
