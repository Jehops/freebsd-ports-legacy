Error analyzes and optionally disperses the diagnostic error messages
produced by a number of compilers and language processors to the
source file and line where the errors occurred.  It can replace the
painful, traditional methods of scribbling abbreviations of errors on
paper, and permits error messages and source code to be viewed
simultaneously without machinations of multiple windows in a screen
editor.

Error knows about the error messages produced by: make(1), cc(1),
cpp(1), ccom(1), as(1), ld(1), lint(1), pi(1), pc(1), f77(1), and DEC
Western Research Modula-2.  However, please note that error hasn't
been taught about the toolchain currently in use on FreeBSD, so the
aforementioned programs may not necessarily be the ones installed on
your system!
