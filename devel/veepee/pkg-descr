VeePee, at its current stage of development, is a set of components aimed at
GNOME and KDE application developers to enable them to easily add scripting
capabilities to their applications. 

Script-enabling an application gives the user the ability to extend the
application in a way that suits the user. It allows them to adapt the
application to solve problems that you hadn't considered when developing the
application. It empowers your users. 

VeePee provides a consistent scripting environment. Users who develop scripting
skills will find that those skills are transferable to all applications that
embed VeePee. 

VeePee provides the user with a set of simple but powerful GUI controls. A
VeePee scripted GUI has the same look and feel as the embedding application,
whether it be a GNOME or a KDE application.
