	Flick, our IDL (interface definition language) compiler, is the research
	and production IDL compiler within the Flux Project. Flick uses
	techniques from traditional language compilers in order to produce very
	fast client/server communication code. Flick-generated code can
	typically encode and decode data between 2 and 17 times faster than code
	produced by traditional IDL compilers, both commercial and free. The
	result is that on stock hardware and operating systems, Flick-generated
	stubs can increase end-to-end application throughput by factors of 4 or
	more.

	Flick is not just optimizing: it is also extremely flexible. Flick
	currently supports the CORBA, ONC RPC (Sun RPC), and MIG IDLs.
	Interfaces written in any of these languages can be implemented by
	CORBA-, ONC RPC-, or MIG-style C language ``stubs'' communicating via
	CORBA IIOP, ONC/TCP, Mach 3 ports, Trapeze, or Fluke IPC. Flick also
	generates optimized CORBA C++ stubs that work with TAO, the real-time
	CORBA ORB. Finally, because Flick is a ``kit'' of components, it can be
	extended to support new IDLs, message data formats, and transport
	mechanisms.
