Callgrind uses runtime instrumentation via the Valgrind framework for its
cache simulation and call tracing. This way, even shared libraries and
dynamically opened plugins can be profiled. The data files generated by
Callgrind can be loaded into KCachegrind for browsing the performance results.

But there is also a command line tool in the Callgrind package to get ASCII
reports from Callgrind data files without the need to use KCachegrind.
