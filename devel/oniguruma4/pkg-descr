Oniguruma is a BSDL Regular Expression library written for ruby-m17n,
which implements all of Perl extensions plus more.  It has multiple
APIs; GNU regex, POSIX regex and its own interface.

This library is fundamentally multilingualized and can have one
encoding for each object.  Currently supported character encodings
are ASCII, UTF-8, EUC-JP and Shift_JIS.
