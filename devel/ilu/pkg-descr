ILU is a CORBA-compatible multi-language Object Request Broker. 

You define class interfaces in a language-independent way and
implement them in a language of your choice. Currently supported
languages are C, Java (See Makefile how to enable Java Support on
FreeBSD), Common Lisp (Allegro CL 4.x in Linux emulation mode may work
on FreeBSD) and Python. Rough support for C++ (the old C++ support is
built by default on FreeBSD) and Guile Scheme (built if you have Guile
+ slib installed) is also present. perl support is available from the
net. ILU also runs on Win32 which means Unix and Win32 objects can
freely talk to each other.

2.0alpha13 supports interoperability with ONC RPC services, OMG CORBA
services, World Wide Web HTTP services, and W3C HTTP-NG services.
``Plug-in'' extensibility is provided for RPC message formats, message
transport schemes, URL schemes, accounting and authorization identity
types, threading and event loop processing, and various other things.
An implementation of the IETF's Common Authentication Technology
working group's Generic Security Service (GSS) is provided, and can be
used to wrap client-server connections in a security context.  An XML
parser is provided.  ILU is provided free for unrestricted use.

FreeBSD port notes:
- I enabled support for the http protocol support.
- The FreeBSD port has its own scheme to build and use shared
  libraries. The official support is incomplete.
- Official ILU patches are not fetched from PARC, but I hold a proven
  snapshot that doesn't conflict with my patches at one of my own sites.
- configure --bindir/--mandir doesn't work with current ILU version.
  I make symbolic links to ${PREFIX}/{bin,man}.
- I don't use shared library version numbers on ELF systems for now.
- Shared library versioning scheme history for aout:
  *.so.1: ilu-2.0a12, *.so.2: ilu-2.0a13
