C/C++ preprocessor expands macros and processes '#if', '#include' and
some other directives.

MCPP is an alternative C/C++ preprocessor with the highest conformance,
implementated by Kiyoshi Matsui.  MCPP is especially useful for
debugging the source program which use complicated macros and also
useful for checking portability of the source.  It supports multiple
standards: K&R, ISO C90, ISO C99, and ISO C++98.

Though mcpp could be built as a replacement of GCC's resident
proprocessor or as a subroutine called from some other main program,
this package installs only a stand-alone program named 'mcpp' which
behaves independent from GCC.
