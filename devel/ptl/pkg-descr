PTL -- Portable Thread Library

PTL is an implementation of a user level multi-thread library based on
POSIX 1003.1c API.  You can create and control multiple threads
(control flow) in one UNIX process using PTL.

For example, PTL can be used for following purposes.

	- Network server/client program
	- Concurrent processing
	- Simulating distributed or parallel algorithms
	- Study of multi thread programming

This library is based on the standard "POSIX 1003.1c" and works on BSD
UNIX (architecture-independent!)
