This library is intended to provide a minimal & complete Object-Oriented (OO)
thread interface for C++ programmers.  It is loosely modeled on the Java thread
API, and the POSIX Threads standards.  The architecture of the library is
designed around "swappable" thread models which are defined at compile-time in
a shared object library.
