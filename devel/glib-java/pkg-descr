Java-GNOME is a set of Java bindings for GNOME and GTK libraries,
so GNOME applications can be written in Java.  It is implemented
as a JNI layer that delegates the Java calls out to the underlying
C library. This port and its 2.x family have however been declared
deprecated and have been replaced by java-gnome 4.0.
