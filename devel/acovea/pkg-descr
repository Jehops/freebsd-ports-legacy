ACOVEA (Analysis of Compiler Options via Evolutionary Algorithm)
implements a genetic algorithm to find the "best" options for
compiling programs with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) C and C++
compilers. "Best", in this context, is defined as those options
that produce the fastest executable program from a given source
code. Acovea is a C++ framework that can be extended to test other
programming languages and non-GCC compilers.
