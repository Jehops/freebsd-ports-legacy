Mk is a replacement for Make originally written for
Research Unix by Andrew Hume and later ported to
Plan 9 and Inferno.  The present version uses sh
instead of rc and is a slightly modified version of
that distributed by Vitanuova.  A version supporting
rc is available from the ports maintainer; the sh
version is that used by Quick C--.
