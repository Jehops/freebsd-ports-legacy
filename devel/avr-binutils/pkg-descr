GNU binutils for Atmel AVR cross-development

Prerequisite for the GCC for AVR cross-compilation environment.

Still included is the "AVR COFF beta" patch.  It allows avr-objcopy to
generate AVR (extended) COFF files to be used on Atmel AVR Studio and
VMLAB.  Note that this patch has known issues, see
