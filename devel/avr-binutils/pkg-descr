GNU binutils for Atmel AVR cross-development

Prerequisite for the GCC for AVR cross-compilation environment.

Still included is the "AVR COFF beta" patch.  It allows avr-objcopy to
generate AVR (extended) COFF files to be used on Atmel AVR Studio and
VMLAB.  Note that this patch has known issues, see
http://www.sax.de/~joerg/README.coff-avr-patch

following AVR devices has been added by a private patch:

  AT90PWM1
  AT90USB82/162
  ATmega164P/324P/644P
  ATmega165P/169P
  ATmega325P/3250P/329P/3290P
