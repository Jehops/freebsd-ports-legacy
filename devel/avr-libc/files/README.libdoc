The file avr-lib.pdf has been obtained from

http://www.enteract.com/~rneswold/avr/avr-lib-beta.pdf

It has been renamed to avr-lib.pdf to remain consistent
with previous versions of the port.
Rich's older avr-lib.pdf is fairly out of date now.

The file avr-libc-reference.html has been obtained from

http://www.bang-gang.org/elektronik/avr/avr-libc-reference.html

(A couple of HTML tag bugs have been fixed manually, so to enable
displaying the email addresses of the authors.)
