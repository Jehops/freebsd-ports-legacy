The Hg-Git plugin is an extension for Mercurial, adding the ability to push to
and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial. This means you can
collaborate on Git based projects from Mercurial, or use a Git server as a
collaboration point for a team with developers using both Git and Mercurial.

The Hg-Git plugin can convert commits / changesets losslessly from one system
to another, so you can push via a Mercurial repository and another Mercurial
client can pull it and their changeset node ids will be identical - Mercurial
data does not get lost in translation.

This plugin is implemented entirely in Python - there are no Git binary
dependencies, you do not need to have Git installed on your system.

*** WARNING: Do not use this software in data critical production environments,
only in safe test environments! This software is still BETA!

It is basically feature complete and pretty stable now, but there could be
still some edge cases. The user interface could also still be changed. However,
there are now a lot of people using it effectively, so please test it yourself
and report encountered bugs upstream (see website). Thanks! ***
