diStorm is a binary stream disassembler. It's capable of disassembling
80x86 instructions in 64 bits (AMD64, X86-64) and both in 16 and 32 bits.
In addition, it disassembles FPU, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, 3DNow! (w/
extensions), new x86-64 instruction sets, VMX, and AMD's SVM! diStorm was
written to decode quickly every instruction as accurately as possible.
Robust decoding, while taking special care for valid or unused prefixes,
is what makes this disassembler powerful, especially for research.
Another benefit that might come in handy is that the module was written
as multi-threaded, which means you could disassemble several streams or
more simultaneously.
