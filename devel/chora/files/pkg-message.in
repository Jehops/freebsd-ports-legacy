Chora has been installed in %%CHORADIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see `pkg_info -D -x horde'.

Then, you may have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the file sourceroots.php.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
