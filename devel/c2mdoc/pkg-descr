c2mdoc is a shell and awk script wrapper which abuses devel/cproto's
parser to spit out function prototypes in a format ready to paste into
FreeBSD developer documentation. c2man already claims to do such a
thing, but seems crippled in the face of our kernel source. The
toolchain used by this port whinges but still generates markup.
