OmniBroker is an Object Request Broker (ORB) that is compliant to the
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification as
defined in:

  The Common Object Request Broker: Architecture and Specification
  Revision 2.0, OMG Document 96-03-04

OmniBroker is free for non-commercial use. See the file LICENSE for
details.

Some highlights of the OmniBroker Preview Release are:

- Full CORBA IDL support

- Complete CORBA IDL-to-C++ mapping

- Uses IIOP as native protocol

- Dynamic Invocation Interface

- Dynamic Skeleton Interface

- Interface Repository

- Peer-to-Peer communication with nested method invocations

- Support for non-blocking method invocations

- Support for timeouts

- Seamless integration with X11 and Windows

- A COS compliant Naming Service

The current beta version has the following limitations:

- Only persistent servers are currently supported

- No multi-threaded applications

Support for the GNU C++ compiler (version 2.7.2) is currently only
experimental. The GNU C++ isn't fully supported yet due to the lack of
a stable exception handling mechanism. On some platforms GNU C++
doesn't support exception handling at all (e.g. MIPS), while on other
platforms the exception handling is still very buggy (SPARC, Intel).
