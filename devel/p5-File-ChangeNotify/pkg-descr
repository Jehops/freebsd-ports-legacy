This module provides an API for creating a File::ChangeNotify::Watcher subclass
that will work on your platform.

A File::ChangeNotify::Watcher class monitors a directory for changes made to
any file. You can provide a regular expression to filter out files you are not
interested in. It handles the addition of new subdirectories by adding them to
the watch list.
