This is a port of Meta-CVS, a version control system built around CVS.
Although it retains most of the features of CVS, including all of the
networking support, it is more capable than CVS, and easier to use.

Its main features are:
 * Directory structure versioning.
 * Support for a promotion model.
 * User-friendly file type handling.
 * Sane corner cases.
 * Simple branching and merging.
 * Support for symbolic links and metadata.
 * Tracking of third party code containing moves and renames.
 * Ease of deployment.
