KeLP is designed and maintained by a group at the University of California
at San Diego.  Associate Professor Scott B. Baden of Computer Science and
Engineering is the director of the KeLP Project KeLP was part of the
dissertation topic of Stephen J. Fink (Ph.D. 1998) and portions of a
prototype of KeLP were developed by Scott R. Kohn (Ph.D. 1995). KeLP is
supported by the NSF, the University of California, San Diego, and the
National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI).
KeLP is part of NPACI's Kommon Adaptive Runtime Environment (KARTE) effort.

KeLP (Kernel Lattice Parallelism) is an infrastructure/interface to
FORTRAN 77 or C numeric kernels using FORTRAN array ordering. It is usually
used for structured block-irregular grid computational applications.  
 KeLP uses coarse-grain data parallelism for its parallel model and should
be run on message-passing parallel computers.
KeLP is targeted towards adaptive mesh refinement applications and
single-grid calculations requiring uniform or non-uniform decompositions
across machine processors. Applications manipulate data decompositions as
language objects through region calculus operations.
