The standard UNIX debugger, gdb, is extremely powerful, but its
command line interface can be quite intimidating and painful to
use.

Code Medic provides an elegant free graphical interface to gdb's
most important features. Unlike most interfaces to gdb, Code Medic
aims to remove the need for the command line.

It provides access to the power of gdb with an intuitive front end.
It currently supports opening multiple source windows at once,
setting/clearing breakpoints while the program is running, watching
variables change in the variable tree as you step through code
(even with nested structs), text searching through source, and
integration with Code Crusader to provide a rapid, efficient
develop-debug cycle.
