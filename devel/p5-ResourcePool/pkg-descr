The ResourcePool provides a generic way to use connection caching for any
kind of resources. The package includes classes to deal with DBI and
Net::LDAP resources and is easily extensible. It has also a LoadBalancer
class to spread load across different servers and is able to do fail over
to increase the overall availability of the service.

Use this package if you... 
   ...want to use connection caching (persistent connections) for something
      which is NOT DBI (e.g. Net::LDAP).
   ...have more then one server which can handle your requests and need to
      implement load balancing and/or fail over.
