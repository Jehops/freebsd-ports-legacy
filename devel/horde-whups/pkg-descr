Whups is Horde's bug tracking/ticketing system. It is designed to be extremely 
flexible in letting users define kinds of tickets, different lifecycles 
(sets of states) and priorities for each kind of ticket, and mixing types of 
tickets into sets of queues. This design allows for very general and 
sophisticated multi-purpose uses of Whups. The code is near 1.0 quality and most
features are fully implemented at this time.
