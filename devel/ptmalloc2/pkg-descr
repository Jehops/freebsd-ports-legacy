ptmalloc is the original version of the malloc that was later included
in GNU libc.  Under some circumsntaces, notably with pthreads and
excessive calls to realloc, it performs significantly better than
FreeBSD malloc.  This version is *not* GPL or LGPL:

This is not the latest version: it's older than the one in GNU libc.
There is a newer version, but it's still marked as "current snapshot".
It's in /usr/ports/devel/ptmalloc-2/.

See the web site for more details: WWW: http://www.malloc.de/en/

This package comes with no documentation beyond a README, which isn't
worth installing.  It appears that the GNU libc man page malloc(3)
applies, but it's not included here for copyright reasons.  There's
nothing unusual about it.  In particular, the section TUNING in
FreeBSD malloc(3) does not apply.

This library uses the POSIX pthread_atfork() function which was not
committed to -CURRENT until 10 December 2004.  See PR bin/68841 for
further details.  To build it on older versions, first install this
patch, which should be transparent.

In addition to the library, the package contains a couple of test
cases.  Theoretically they could be run using the FreeBSD libraries,
but they call the legacy memalign() function, which is not provided by
FreeBSD.  It may be of interest to fix this issue.
