Announcing version 1.0 of PRCS, the Project Revision Control System.
PRCS is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way
to deal with sets of files and directories as an entity, preserving
coherent versions of the entire set.

PRCS was designed primarily by Professor P. N. Hilfinger, with input
and modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Josh MacDonald.  PRCS is
written and maintained by Josh MacDonald.

Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according
to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those
systems.

To compile and install PRCS, read the instructions in the INSTALL
file.  Once you have done this, you should at least read the first few
sections of the documentation.  It is available in info format.  All
documentation is located in the doc/ subdirectory.

The current release, version 1.0, and future releases of PRCS can be
found at ftp://XCF.Berkeley.EDU/pub/prcs.  HTML documentation and
recent developments are available online at

   http://www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU/~jmacd/prcs.html.

PRCS is released under the GNU public license, see the file COPYING
for details.
