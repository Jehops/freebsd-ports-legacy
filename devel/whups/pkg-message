Whups has been installed in %%WHUPSDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see:
- %%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde2/pkg-message

Then, you have to create the tables required by Whups, from the SQL script
%%WHUPSDIR%%/scripts/drivers/whups.sql,
in the horde database or in a special database.
For example, if your database is MySQL, you may run
mysql --user=hordemgr --password=yourpass horde < whups.sql
(If you run another database server, see
 %%HORDEDIR%%/scripts/db/README
 for more explanations.)

Finally, you may have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the files conf.php.
In the file %%HORDEDIR%%/config/horde.php,
at least one user should be defined as an admin:
$conf['auth']['admins'] = array('admin', 'insert_user_login');

Go to the <URL:http://localhost/horde/>;, log in with this user,
and click on "Administration" to define your parameters.

N.B.: permissions are not yet implemented!

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
