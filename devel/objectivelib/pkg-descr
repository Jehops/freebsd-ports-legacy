ObjectiveLib provides two primary services: containers and algorithms.
An important part of the library that keeps everything moving is
iterators.  ObjectiveLib is designed to offer the same functionality
to Objective-C programmers that the Standard Template Library offers
to C++ programmers. Therefore, anyone familiar with the STL will have
no trouble using and understanding the machinery of ObjectiveLib.
