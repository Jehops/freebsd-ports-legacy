This package contains four programs for converting diffs. Diff files are
created by GNU diff and accepted as input by GNU patch. The two most common
forms are "context diffs" and "unidiffs".

  ud2cd          converts a unidiff (input) to a context diff (output).
  cd2ud          converts a context diff (input) to a unidiff (output).
  cdiffreverse   reverses a context diff.
  udiffreverse   reverses a unidiff.

cd2ud is dedicated to David S. Miller "context diffs make my head spin".
