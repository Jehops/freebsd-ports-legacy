File::Temp is a Perl5 module which can be used to generate temporary files
(providing a filename and filehandle) or directories.  Possible race
conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed (e.g. making
sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).

It should be considered to be in a beta state.
