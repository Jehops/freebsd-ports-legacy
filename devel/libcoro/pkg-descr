Excerpt from The Art of Computer Programming by D. E. Knuth:

	"Subroutines are special cases of more general program
	 components, called coroutines.  In contrast to the un-
	 symmetric relationship between a main routine and a sub-
	 routine, there is complete symmetry between coroutines,
	 which call on each other."

coro is a C library that implements the low level handling of coroutines.
Despite it's simplicity, there is no portable way to implement them. The goal
of this library is to build a standard API for coroutines and implement it
for as many architectures as possible. Currently only the i386 architecture
is supported.
