Moose is wonderful.  Use Moose instead of Mouse!

Unfortunately, Moose has a compile-time penalty. Though significant progress has
been made over the years, the compile time penalty is a non-starter for some
applications.

Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of Moose's functionality,
faster.

Compatibility with Moose has been the utmost concern. Fewer than 1% of the
tests fail when run against Moose instead of Mouse. Mouse code coverage is also
over 97%. Even the error messages are taken from Moose. The Mouse code just
runs the test suite 3x-4x faster.

The idea is that, if you need the extra power, you should be able to run
s/Mouse/Moose/g on your codebase and have nothing break. To that end,
we have written Any::Moose which will act as Mouse unless Moose is loaded,
in which case it will act as Moose.
 
Mouse also has the blessings of Moose's author, stevan.
