Moose is wonderful.

Unfortunately, it's a little slow. Though significant progress has been made
over the years, the compile time penalty is a non-starter for some applications.

Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of Moose's functionality,
faster. In particular, "has" in Moose is missing only a few expert-level
features.

Compatibility with Moose has been the utmost concern. Fewer than 1% of the
tests fail when run against Moose instead of Mouse. Mouse code coverage is also
over 97%. Even the error messages are taken from Moose. The Mouse code just
runs the test suite 3x-4x faster.

The idea is that, if you need the extra power, you should be able to run
s/Mouse/Moose/g on your codebase and have nothing break. To that end,
nothingmuch has written Squirrel (part of this distribution) which will act as
Mouse unless Moose is loaded, in which case it will act as Moose.

Mouse also has the blessings of Moose's author, stevan.
