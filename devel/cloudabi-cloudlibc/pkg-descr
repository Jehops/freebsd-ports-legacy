Nuxi CloudABI is an application binary interface for UNIX-like operating
systems built around the concept of capability-based security. In a
nutshell, it means that you can run processes directly on top of a UNIX
kernel while keeping complete control over the actions the process is
allowed to perform.

cloudlibc is a standard C library built on top of CloudABI. It
implements almost all features of the C11 standard, but also a large
part of POSIX.1-2008.
