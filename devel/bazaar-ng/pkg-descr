Bazaar-NG is a distributed version control system from Canonical.
Bazaar-NG allows you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually
source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like SVN,
CVS, or RCS. Bazaar-NG is distributed, which gives it significant advantages and
some disadvantages compared to SVN and CVS. The bzr implementation is the next
Bazaar version from Canonical called Bazaar-NG.
