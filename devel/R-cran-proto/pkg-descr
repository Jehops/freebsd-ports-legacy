proto (google code name r-proto) is an R package which facilitates
a style of programming known as prototype-based programming.
Prototype-based programming is a type of object oriented (OO)
programming in which classes and objects are unified into a single
concept, prototypes. This makes proto and prototye programming
simpler than the usual OO model yet it retains the OO features of
inheritance (known as delegation in the prototype model) and OO
dispatch. Applications, News, Additional Information sources, Proto
Bugs and Avoiding R Bugs sections are given below while associated
