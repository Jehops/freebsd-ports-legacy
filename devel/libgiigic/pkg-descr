libgiigic is a convinience library that works on top of libgii whereby gic
stands for 'General Input Configuration'.
It provides easy Descent/Forsaken style input configuration.
It basically handles binding of keystrokes, mice and valuators to program
actions. For short, it allows to configure input events with actions as you
know from modern computer games.
