"BK/Pro is a scalable configuration management system, supporting globally
distributed development, disconnected operation, compressed repositories,
change sets, and repositories as branches.

Distributed means that every developer gets their own personal repository,
complete with revision history, and the tool handles moving changes between
repositories. SSH, RSH, BKD, HTTP, and/or SMTP can all be used as communication
transports between repositories; or, if both are local, the system just uses
the file system."
