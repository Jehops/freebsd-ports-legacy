mxProxy is a Python extension package which provides a new type that can be
used to implement Bastion-like features without the need to use restricted
execution environments. 

The type's main features are secure data encapsulation (the hidden objects
are not accessible from Python since they are stored in internal C
structures), customizable attribute lookup methods and a cleanup protocol
that helps in breaking circular references prior to object deletion.
