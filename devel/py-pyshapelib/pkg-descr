Python bindings for Shapelib
============================

These are three python modules for shapelib:

   shapelib     read/write shapefiles

   dbflib       read/write dbf files

   shptree      quadtree for shapes

Shapelib is a free software library for reading and writing ESRI shape
files and can be found at http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib. 

The bindings were partly created with SWIG, a tool that can generate
wrappers of C and C++ libraries for a variety of scripting languages.
It's homepage is http://www.swig.org.

The bindings themselves don't have a homepage at the moment, but the
source tarballs/zip files can be downloaded from
