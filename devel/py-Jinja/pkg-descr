Jinja is a small but very fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
written in pure python.
Since version 0.6 it uses a new parser that increases parsing performance
a lot by caching the nodelists on the harddisk if wanted.
It includes multiple template inheritance and other features like simple
value escaping.
