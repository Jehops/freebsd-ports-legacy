This is a complete set of memory allocation functions (malloc and
friends) from the Computer Systems Research Institute at U of Toronto.

	The allocator is small, fast and space-efficient. 

	It performs coalescing on frees. 

	It has hooks for profiling, tracing and memory leak detection. 

	It has very comprehensive and paranoid errorchecking as a compile
	time option, enough to detect most forms of heap corruption.

	Optionally, it attempts to be compatible with the proposed ANSI C
	Standard definition for the standard library functions malloc(),
	calloc(), realloc() and free(). By default, it is more or less
	compatible with existing Unix malloc() functions - some
	differences do exist. (Notably free(), cfree() returning void,
	realloc() not accepting a freed block)
