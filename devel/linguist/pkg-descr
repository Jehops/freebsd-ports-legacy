Qt Linguist, localization tool, allows users to seamlessly convert Qt-based
programs from one language to another, simply and intelligently. Qt Linguist
helps with the translation of all visible text in a program, to and from any
language supported by Unicode and the target platforms. A key feature in Qt
Linguist is a specialized editing tool, with many features to help the
translators be more productive and get better results. Qt Linguist will work
with both Qt/Windows and Qt for UNIX.

Qt Linguist also includes a pre-installed intelligent database of multi-lingual
terms to assist in the translation process. Once new translations are made, the
database saves the terms for later re-use. This provides translators a tool
that greatly increases work efficiency as they continue to use the product.
