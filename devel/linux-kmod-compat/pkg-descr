This port is an emulation layer to port linux device drivers to FreeBSD,
mostly oriented to USB device drivers where FreeBSD support is weaker.
It contains:
- a set of headers with declarations for entities used in the Linux kernel;
- a compatibility library (in source form) mapping [part of] the linux kernel
  APIs to equivalent FreeBSD APIs;
- a template for character device drivers.
Ideally, the porting of a linux driver should be as simple as downloading
the linux driver sources, writing a simple Makefile.kmod, and running
"make -f Makefile.kld" to produce your driver.ko.
