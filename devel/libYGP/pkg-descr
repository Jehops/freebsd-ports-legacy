A C++ library, separated in 2 parts:

* A common one, designed to have no dependencies to the operating system
  or any library, providing:
  o A class for communication,
  o Classes to handle regular expressions (both common and UNIX-file like),
  o A general parser,
  o Smart pointers
  o A class to search directories
  o A relation-class to relate objects

* Some classes for the X-windows system (basing on gtkmm (previously
  known as Gtk--)) like:
  o An entry field to enter filenames (with completion, analogue to modern
    browsers),
  o Formatted entry fields (with validy check),
  o A ListBox to display files (with an icon based on the type of the file),
  o A base-class for Applications
