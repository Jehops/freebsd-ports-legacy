Class::AutoClass => similar to Class::MakeMethods, provides support for:
  - automatically generating mutator methods for simple values,
  - allows for automatic attribute initialization and default value
	initilaization, 
  - object initialization is handled correctly (in top-down order), even
	in the presence of multiple inheritance
