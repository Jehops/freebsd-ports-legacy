This module is designed to support operations commonly
performed on file specifications (usually called "file
names", but not to be confused with the contents of a
file, or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating
several directory and file names into a single path, or
determining whether a path is rooted. It is based on code
directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code written by
Andreas Koenig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya
Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.
