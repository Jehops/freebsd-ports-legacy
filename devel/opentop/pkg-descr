OpenTop contains framework classes that provide the features you need
to write network-centric, web-enabled and internationalized applications
in C++. It enables you to:

* create network clients and servers using either raw socket facilities
  or higher-level protocols such as HTTP and FTP. 
* create multi-threaded applications and manage synchronization between
  threads using simple but effective threading abstractions which are
  common to all platforms. 
* use the full Unicode character range, using built-in character types
  and standard string classes. 
* use byte and character streams and manipulate files using an API
  inspired by the excellent java.io package. 
* take advantage of its open architecture by registering your own
  (or third-party) classes to perform custom processing. 
* write portable applications and extension libraries. OpenTop is
  an ideal base on which to deliver cross-platform solutions, benefitting
  independent software vendors and corporate IT departments. 
* integrate XML into your C++ applications with the C++ XML Toolkit
  extension library.
