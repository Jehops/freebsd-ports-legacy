The Open Phishing Database project is an effort to create and
maintain and open database of phishing sites, in addition to
providing browser extensions which utilise this database in
order to provide users with a safer browsing experience.

libphish is a cross-platform library to interact with the Open
Phishing Database, in order to provide a consistent API which
browsers and other programs can use to verify the safety and
risk level of URLs.

Another part of OPDB is a Konqueror Anti-Phishing toolbar
(see www/karpion port) and FirePhish - a Firefox Anti-Phishing
toolbar.
