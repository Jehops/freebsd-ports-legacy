FOSSology has been installed!

The following is a quick setup guide, for more information see the
documentation available at "%%DOCSDIR%%".

1. Install PostgreSQL server: initialize database and start the daemon.

2. Increase shared memory limit, by running:
   # sysctl kern.ipc.shmmax=512000000

   And to make the change persistent add this line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
   kern.ipc.shmmax=512000000

3. Configure PHP: put the following in your php.ini file:

   max_execution_time = 90
   memory_limit = 702M
   post_max_size = 701M
   upload_max_filesize = 700M

4. Configure Apache, add the following to your httpd.conf:

   Alias /repo/ %%DATADIR%%/www/
   <Directory "%%DATADIR%%/www">
     AllowOverride None
     Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
     # uncomment to turn on php error reporting
     #php_flag display_errors on
     #php_value error_reporting 2039
   </Directory>

5. Add the following to a robots.txt file to avoid them to index the site:

   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /repo

6. Run the post installation setup script:

   # %%PREFIX%%/lib/fossology/fo-postinstall

   IMPORTANT: if you have the web server running, you must restart it
   because the "www" user has been added to the "fossy" group. Without
   this you will get a "Permission denied" when accessing
   "http://localhost/repo/".

7. Enable at startup, add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

   fossology_enable="YES"

   To start now use this additional command (requires previous, at least
   you use "forcestart" instead of "start"):

   # %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/fossology start
