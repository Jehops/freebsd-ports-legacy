Smake is a highly portable make program with automake features. It is
currently mainly targeted to be used with the Makefiles system.

The system allows mounting a source tree via NFS and simultaneous
compilation on all supported platforms.  The system therefore allows the
re-use of a source tree for all supported platforms in contrast to the GNU
concept of untar -> configure -> make -> install -> remove
