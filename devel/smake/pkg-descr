Smake is a highly portable make program with automake features. It is 
currently mainly targeted to be used with the makefiles system.

makefiles allows to mount a source tree via NFS and simultaneous compilation 
on all supported platforms
makefiles therefore allows to re-use a source tree for all supported platforms
in favor of the GNU concept of untar -> configure -> make -> install -> remove
