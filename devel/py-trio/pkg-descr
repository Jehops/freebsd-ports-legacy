The Trio project’s goal is to produce a production-quality,
permissively licensed, async/await-native I/O library for Python.
Like all async libraries, its main purpose is to help you write
programs that do multiple things at the same time with parallelized
I/O. A web spider that wants to fetch lots of pages in parallel, a
web server that needs to juggle lots of downloads and websocket
connections at the same time, a process supervisor monitoring
multiple subprocesses… that sort of thing. Compared to other
libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish itself with an obsessive
focus on usability and correctness. Concurrency is complicated; we
try to make it easy to get things right.
