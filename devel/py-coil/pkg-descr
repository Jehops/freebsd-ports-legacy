Coil: A Configuration Library.

Introduction
============
  Coil is a configuration file format that is parsed into a tree of
  dict like Struct objects. The format supports inheritance, allowing
  complicated configurations to be as compact as possible.

Design Goals
============
  General design/implementation goals, some have been met, others are
  still in progress.

    - Support Twisted and non-Twisted reactor driven Python programs.
    - Scalable to complex configurations, easily avoiding duplication.
    - Orthogonal to code; code should not be required to know about the
      config system used, it should be regular Python or Twisted code.
    - Minimal boilerplate.
