Flexmock is a mock/stub/spy library for Python.

Its API is inspired by a Ruby library of the same name.
However, it is not a goal of Python Flexmock to be a clone of
the Ruby version. Instead, the focus is on providing full support
for testing Python programs and making the creation of fake
objects as unobtrusive as possible.

As a result, Python Flexmock removes a number of redandancies in
the Ruby Flexmock API, alters some defaults, and introduces a
number of Python-only features.

Flexmock declarations are structured to read more like English
sentences than API calls, and it is possible to chain them
together in any order to achieve high degree of expressiveness
in a single line of code.
