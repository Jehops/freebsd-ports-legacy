The A-A-P GUI IDE is a framework in which separate tools can work
together.  Like any other Integrated Development Environment it
supports:

  * Creating a project
  * Building and executing a program
  * Browsing files
  * Debugging a program while displaying source code

Instead of forming a monolithic application Agide provides
interfaces to plugin existing tools.  Currently plugins for Vim
and gdb are operational.  You can add your own plugins.
