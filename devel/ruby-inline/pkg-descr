Inline::C allows for quick and use of inlined C code in Ruby scripts.
This library automatically:

* provides rudimentary automatic conversion between Ruby and C basic
  types: (unsigned)? (char|int|long|char *)
* provides compilation of inline code
* only recompiles if the C code has changed
* can easily provide speedups in excess of 25x for tight loops when
  objects are being recycled too quickly.
