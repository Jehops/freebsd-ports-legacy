2) Import the Flyspray database tables into your new empty database. Here is
the unix/linux command line method; be sure to enter your mysql root
password when prompted:

# mysql -u root -p flyspray < flyspray-version.sql

3) Edit the header.php file to suit your database setup.  Examples are
provided in the file.  You will need to set your database type to an ADODB
