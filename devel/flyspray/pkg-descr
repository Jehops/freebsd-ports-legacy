Need a bug tracking system for your programming project? Having trouble
finding something that suits your needs? Tried installing Bugzilla, but
found it too complex?

Flyspray is an easy to use bug tracking system for those who don't require
all the complexities of something like Bugzilla.

Initially developed for the Psi project, Flyspray is now available for
everyone to download and use for their own projects.
