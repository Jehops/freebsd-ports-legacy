SimpleParse is a BSD-licensed Python package providing a simple parser
generator for use with the mxTextTools text-tagging engine. SimpleParse allows
you to generate tagging tables for use with the text-tagging engine directly
from your EBNF grammar.

Unlike most parser generators, SimpleParse generates single-pass parsers
(there is no distinct tokenization stage), an approach taken from the
predecessor project (mcf.pars) which attempted to create "autonomously parsing
regex objects". The resulting parsers are not as generalized as those created
by, for instance, the Earley algorithm, but they do tend to be useful for the
parsing of computer file formats and the like (as distinct from natural
language and similar "hard" parsing problems).

In addition to the parser generator, the SimpleParse project includes a
sub-project to create a modified version of the mxTextTools engine which
reorganizes the code to allow for certain common EBNF constructs.
