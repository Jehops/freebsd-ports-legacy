This package provides standardized, efficient versions of utility classes
commonly encountered in concurrent Java programming. This code consists of
implementations of ideas that have been around for ages, and is merely intended
to save you the trouble of coding them.

The package mainly consists of implementations of a few interfaces:

  * Sync -- locks, conditions
  * Channel -- queues, buffers
  * Barrier -- multi-party synchronization
  * SynchronizedVariable -- atomic ints, refs etc
  * java.util.Collection -- collections
  * Executor -- replacements for direct use of Thread

Plus some utilities and frameworks that build upon these.

This package was the precursor to java.util.concurrent.
