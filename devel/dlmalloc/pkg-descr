This is a version (aka dlmalloc) of malloc/free/realloc written by Doug Lea
and released to the public domain.  Use, modify, and redistribute this code

This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or most
tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest while also being
among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable. Consistent balance
across these factors results in a good general-purpose allocator for
malloc-intensive programs.
