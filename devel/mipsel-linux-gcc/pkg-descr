  It is gcc (c and c++ compiler suite) for  MIPS Little Endian Linux
  (mipsel-linux) target with SNOW ABI.
  This target is, for example, VR Linux on NEC's VR-based PDAs (Agenda VR3
  and others).
  This port doesn't contains any libraries or headers. To build it you must
  have headers for your target in ${PREFIX}/mipsel-linux/include directory.
  Headers and libraries for Agenda VR6 PDA could be installed from
  devel/agenda-headers and devel/agenda-libs ports.
