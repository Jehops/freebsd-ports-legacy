A closed loop, high-performance, general purpose protocol-blind fuzzer for C
programs.

Uses compiler-level integration to seamlessly inject precise and reliable
instrumentation hooks into the traced program. These hooks enable the fuzzer to
receive real-time feedback on changes to the function call path, call
parameters, and return values in response to variations in input data.

This architecture makes it possible to significantly improve the coverage of the
testing process without a noticeable performance impact usually associated with
other attempts to peek into run-time internals.
