perlbrew is a program to automate the building and
installation of perl in the users HOME.

By default, it installs everything to $ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew,
and requires you to tweak your PATH by including
a bashrc/cshrc file it provides.

You then can benefit from not having to run 'sudo' commands
to install cpan modules because those are installed inside
your HOME too.

It's a completely separate perl environment.
