NOTES:  This package is intended to run on FreeBSD 4.0-current or
FreeBSD 3.X, with sources more recent than March 1, 1999, i386 processors
only.

Compile your applications that use Linux Threads with the following
command line options:

	-D_THREAD_SAFE -I/usr/local/include/pthread/linuxthreads -llthread

Note that the include (-I..) directive shown here should appear before any other include
directive that would cause the compiler to find the FreeBSD file /usr/include/pthread.h.
Using the FreeBSD pthread.h instead of the linuxthreads pthread.h will result in an app 
fails in many odd and maybe spectacular ways.

In order to facilitate porting applications witch expect a libpthread, you can create
the following symlinks if you want:

	ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblthread.a /usr/lib/libpthread.a
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblthread_p.a /usr/lib/libpthread_p.a
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblthread.so.0 /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblthread.so.0 /usr/lib/libpthread.so
	/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/lib

If you do this, you can instead use:

	-D_THREAD_SAFE -I/usr/local/include/pthread/linuxthreads -lpthread
or      
	-D_THREAD_SAFE -I/usr/local/include/pthread/linuxthreads -kthread

DO NOT use libc_r with Linux Threads, and do not compile/link with
the -pthread option (which pulls in libc_r).  DO link with libc
(which you will get by default).
