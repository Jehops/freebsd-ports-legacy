NOTES:  This package is intended to run on FreeBSD 4.0-current or
FreeBSD 3.X, with sources more recent than March 1, 1999.

This package does not currently work on an SMP machine. It also only
works on i386 architectures.

Compile your applications that use Linux Threads with the following
command line options:

	-D_THREAD_SAFE -DLINUXTHREADS -lpthread
or (equivalently):
	-D_THREAD_SAFE -DLINUXTHREADS -kthread

DO NOT use libc_r with Linux Threads, and do not compile/link with
the -pthread option (which pulls in libc_r).  DO link with libc
(which you will get by default).
