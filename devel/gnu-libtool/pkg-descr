This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.

This port is specifically designed for developers that want to create
cross-platform software distributions on FreeBSD.  This version of libtool
should _NEVER_ be used with the FreeBSD ports system as a replacement for the
versioned copies of libtool.
