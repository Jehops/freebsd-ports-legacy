American fuzzy lop is a fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time
instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean,
interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted
binary.  This substantially improves the functional coverage for the
fuzzed code.  The compact synthesized corpora produced by the tool are
also useful for seeding other, more labor- or resource-intensive testing
regimes down the road.
