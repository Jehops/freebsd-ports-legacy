1. In order to run this port, please add the following line to /etc/rpc if
it is not already there:

==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==
sgi_fam		391002
==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==

2. If you wish to run fam from inetd (the recommended method), then
please add the following lines to /etc/inetd.conf if they are not
already there:

==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==
# FAM: File Alteration Monitor [devel/fam]
sgi_fam/1-2	stream rpc/tcp wait root /usr/local/bin/fam	fam
==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==

After modifying /etc/inetd.conf, you must (as root) run:

	killall -HUP inetd

3. If, instead, you wish to run fam as a system daemon, then (as root)
do the following:

	cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d
	cp fam.sh.sample fam.sh
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/fam.sh start
