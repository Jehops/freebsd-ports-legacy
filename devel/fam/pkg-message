1. In order to run this port, please add the following line to /etc/rpc if
it is not already there:

==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==
sgi_fam		391002
==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==

2. To run fam from inetd (the recommended method), then please add the
following lines to /etc/inetd.conf if they are not already there:

==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==
# FAM: File Alteration Monitor [devel/fam]
sgi_fam/1-2	stream rpc/tcp wait root /usr/local/bin/fam	fam
==8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<====8<==

After modifying /etc/inetd.conf, you must (as root) run:

	killall -HUP inetd
