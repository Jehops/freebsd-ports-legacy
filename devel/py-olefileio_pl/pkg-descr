OleFileIO_PL is a Python module to read Microsoft OLE2 files (also called
Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound Document File
Format), such as Microsoft Office documents, Image Composer and FlashPix
files, Outlook messages, ...
This is an improved version of the OleFileIO module from PIL, the excellent
Python Imaging Library, created and maintained by Fredrik Lundh.  The API is
still compatible with PIL, but the internal implementation has been improved
significantly, with new features, bugfixes and a more robust design.
