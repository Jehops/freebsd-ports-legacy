This is an XML parser based on PHP's built-in xml extension.  It
supports two basic modes of operation: "func" and "event".  In "func"
mode, it will look for a function named after each element
(xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and
in "event" mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.
