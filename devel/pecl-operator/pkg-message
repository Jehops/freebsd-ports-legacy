  Version 0.3 of the operator package adds support for comparator ops.

  Please note: ZE treats > style comparisons as backwards < comparisons,
  so what looks like a left-associative greater than becomes a right-associative
  less-than. Because of this, overloading the > and >= operators for
  left-association requires application of a parser patch.

  If you would like to use this new functionality, please copy
  compare-greater-5.1.2.diff patch file from operator-0.3 distributive
  to ${PORTSDIR}/lang/php5/files/patch-compare-greater-5.1.2.diff
  reinstall PHP engine and then install pecl-operator package.
