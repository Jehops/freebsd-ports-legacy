This project's goal is to make releases with Elixir projects a
breeze. It is composed of a mix task, and build files required to
successfully take your Elixir project and perform a release build,
and a simplified configuration mechanism which integrates with your
current configuration and makes it easy for your operations group
to configure the release once deployed.
