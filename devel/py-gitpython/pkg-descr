GitPython is a python library used to interact with
Git repositories. GitPython provides object model
access to your git repository. Once you have created
a repository object, you can traverse it to find
parent commit(s), trees, blobs, etc.

GitPython is a port of the grit library in Ruby
created by Tom Preston-Werner and Chris Wanstrath.
