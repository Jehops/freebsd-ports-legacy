WARNING: distcc[d] performs NO AUTHENTICATION at all and should
ONLY be used in trusted networks!

The daemon runs on port 3632 by default. You can change that
value by calling distccd with the -p parameter, e.g.
`distccd -p 4711'.

Note that remote daemons currently won't work if they cannot
resolve the reverse DNS of the master machine
