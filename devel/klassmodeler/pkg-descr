The KlassModeler is a tool for visually creating and documenting classes. It is
not unlike other UML design tools except for four major differences:
    * Strict focus on class modeling: UML as a whole does a lot of things that
      I never really found a use for. I am only interested in class and
      inheritance modeling and documentation. I don't like having lots of
      comments in my source, so I find it nicer to have the docs in the class
      model.
    * Code generation: I think there are some UML tools out there that do this,
      but they tend to generate it with lots of special comments that tell the
      tool where things are and how to re-write the files and all that. The
      KlassModeler writes headers that I find clean and easy to read.
    * Reads existing headers: You can point it to a header file and it will
      read it in and create a class diagram. You can use this functionality to
      import existing projects into KlassModeler.
    * HTML doc generation: It spits out a set of HTML pages that puts all your
      documentation in an easy to read format that can be used with any web
      browser. A very big plus for helping other people understand your code.
