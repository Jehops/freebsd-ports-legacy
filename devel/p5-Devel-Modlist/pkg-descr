The Devel::Modlist perl module provides a means by which to get a
quick run-down on which libraries and modules are being utilized
by a given perl script.

Just as compiler systems like gcc provide dependancy information
via switches such as -M, Devel::Modlist is intended to assist script
authors in preparing dependancy information for potential users of
their scripts.
