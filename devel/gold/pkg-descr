Gold is a new linker, written from scratch. It really only has one new feature
compared to the current GNU linker: it's much faster. I've measured it as five
times faster linking large C++ applications. Since for most programmers the
linker is nothing more than a roadblock between writing code and running the
program, I figure that speed and correctness are the only really important
features of any linker.
