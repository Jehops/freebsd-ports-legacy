The MUSCLE Framework provides cross-compatibility across multiple vendor 
smartcards and it's client side API provides cross-compatibility across many
platforms. By being built on PC/SC and providing simple, clean functionality
for multiple platforms it is possible to develop cross-platform applications
which make use of cryptographic smartcards and tokens, independant of both the
car/crypto token manufacturer, operating system and platform.
