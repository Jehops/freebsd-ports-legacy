This is a Perl-based make replacement, but does not provide make
compatibility. It has a number of powerful capabilities not found in other
software construction systems, including make.

You will need Perl 5.002 or better and the Perl MD5 Extension
(MD5-1.6.tar.gz or greater), available from CPAN.

This program is known to work on a variety of platforms: it's in production
use on versions of FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, IRIX and NT.
