The linux_js kernel module supports analog joysticks through the
joy(4) driver, which must be loaded as a module or compiled into the
kernel. USB joysticks are not yet supported.

To load the kernel module immediately, type the following command:

	kldload linux_js

To load the kernel module at boot, add the following line to
/boot/loader.conf:

	linux_js_load="YES"

To test your joystick(s), type the following command:

	jstest /dev/input/js0

To calibrate your joystick(s), type the following command:

	jscal -c /dev/input/js0

To save the calibration data at system shutdown and restore it at
boot, add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

	jscal_enable="YES"
