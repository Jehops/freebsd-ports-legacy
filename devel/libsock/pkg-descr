The libsock library implements a streamlined interface for multi-threaded TCP/IP
socket programming.  The main purpose of the library is to abstract the
complexities of threaded network server programming without compromising
performance.  libsock centrally handles all of the poll() waiting in one thread
to improve performance, at the same time as making reading and writing seem
completely asynchronous at the sock interface level.
