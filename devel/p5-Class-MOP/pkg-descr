This module is an attempt to create a meta object protocol for the
Perl 5 object system. It makes no attempt to change the behavior or
characteristics of the Perl 5 object system, only to create a protocol
for its manipulation and introspection.

That said, it does attempt to create the tools for building a rich set
of extensions to the Perl 5 object system. Every attempt has been made
for these tools to keep to the spirit of the Perl 5 object system that
we all know and love.
