omniORBpy is an object request broker (ORB) for Python which implements
specification 2.3 of the Common Object Request Broker Arhitecture (CORBA).
omniORBpy is implemented as a Python extension module (written in C++) to
provide bindings for omniORB3, a high performance C++ ORB.

Some features of omniORB3:
- Support for the Portable Object Adapter (POA)
- Support for the Interoperable Naming Service (INS)
- The Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP 1.0) is used as the native protocol. 
- The omniORB3 runtime is fully multithreaded. It uses native platform thread
  support encapsulated with a small class library, omnithread, to abstract
  away from differences in native thread APIs. 
- TypeCode and type Any are supported. 
- DynAny is supported (CORBA 2.2) 
- The Dynamic Invocation and Dynamic Skeleton interfaces are supported 
- A COS Naming Service, omniNames, is provided.
