Test::Unit a unit testing framework for the Ruby programming language,

This is the successor to RUnit (devel/ruby-unit) and includes a
compatibility layer which is only installed if RUnit is not installed
already.  Most RUnit test cases will pass without any modification.

The unit testing framework is known as part of Kent Beck's "eXtreme
Programming" (XP).  For details, see http://www.xprogramming.com/.
