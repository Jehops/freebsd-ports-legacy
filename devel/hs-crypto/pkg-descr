Haskell Cryptographic Library

This library collects together existing Haskell cryptographic functions and
augments them so that they:

* Have common type signatures.
* Can be used with the standard mode and padding algorithms (in the case of
  block mode ciphers).

It contains: DES, Blowfish, Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, PKCS#5 and nulls
             padding, SHA-1, RSA, OAEP, ASN.1, and PKCS#8.
