Part of the NewWebScript an Apache module that allows webpage
developers to embed Tcl code into their HTML, creating webpages
with active content.

This part is a general purpose part of NWS adding many convinience
commands and procedures, including operating with serial devices,
Berkeley DB2, and some client/server databases (Oracle, Postgres --
if you have those installed).

SYNOPSIS: package require Neo

Unfortunately, the authors only distribute a GIANT source tarball
including the entire Apache, db-2, TCL, itcl, gd, TclX, etc. This
port will download the whole beast, but will only extract the neotcl
part of it.

The port is built without the LDAP support. Our port of OpenLDAP2
uses DB3, and linking both DB2 and DB3 into the same executable is
too ugly. Some day, Neo will be updated to use DB3, and we will all
rejoice.
