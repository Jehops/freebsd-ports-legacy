Combat is a CORBA Object Request Broker that allows the implementation of CORBA
clients and servers in the Tcl programming language.

On the client side, Combat is not only useful to easily test-drive existing
CORBA servers, including the ability for rapid prototyping or to interactively
interface with servers from a console, but makes Tcl an exciting language for
distributed programming. Also, Tk allows to quickly develop attractive user
interfaces accessing CORBA services. Server-side scripting using [incr Tcl]
classes also offers a wide range of possibilities.

Combat is compatible with the CORBA 3.0 specification including the IIOP
protocol, and has been tested to interoperate with a wide range of open-source
and commercial ORBs, including MICO, TAO and ORBexpress.

Combat is written in pure Tcl, allowing it to run on all platforms supported by
Tcl, which is a much wider range than supported by any other ORB.
