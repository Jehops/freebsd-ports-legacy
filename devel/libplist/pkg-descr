libimobiledevice is a software library that talks the protocols to
support iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad devices on Linux. Unlike other
projects, it does not depend on using any existing proprietary
libraries and does not require jailbreaking. It allows other software
to easily access the device's filesystem, retrieve information about
the device and its internals, backup/restore the device, manage
SpringBoard icons, manage installed applications, retrieve
addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks and synchronize music and
video to the device.
