ViewCVS was inspired by cvsweb (Zeller's version).  ViewCVS
can browse directories, change logs, and specific revisions
of files. It can display diffs between versions and show
selections of files based on tags or branches. In addition,
ViewCVS has "annotation" or "blame" support, and the
beginnings of Bonsai-like query facilities.
