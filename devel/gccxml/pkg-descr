The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description
of a C++ program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy
to parse, other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs
without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.

GCC-XML was developed by Brad King at Kitware to be used by CABLE, which
was developed as part of the NLM Insight Segmentation and Registration
Toolkit project.
