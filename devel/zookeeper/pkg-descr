ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for
distributed applications. It exposes a simple set of primitives that
applications can build upon to implement higher level services
for synchronization, configuration maintenance, and groups and naming.
It is designed to be easy to program to, and uses a data model
styled after the familiar directory tree structure of filesystems.
