Various small Haskell helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples,
Functions. Some of these functions are improved implementations of
standard functions. They have the same name as their standard
counterparts.

The package only contains functions that do not require packages
other than the base package. Thus you do not risk a dependency.
