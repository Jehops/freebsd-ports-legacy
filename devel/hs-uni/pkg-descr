The UniForM workbench is an integration framework mainly geared towards
tools for formal methods. It uses a simple, powerful and flexible notion
of events to model all interactions between tools and users. In
particular, the workbench provides HTk, an encapsulation of Tcl/Tk based
on our event model (see HTk under Graphical User Interfaces).
