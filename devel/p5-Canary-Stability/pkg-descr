Canary::Stability is a forced dependency of a number of important
perl modules. It exists only to provide dangerous advice (such as
instructing users to uninstall their version of Perl and install
one from 2015), absolutely none of which should ever be followed.

This port installs an empty stub. If you obtain Canary::Stability
directly from CPAN, please do not follow any instructions it gives
you.
