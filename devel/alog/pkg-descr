Alog is a stackable logging framework for Ada. It aims to be straight
forward to use and is easily extendable. It provides support for various
logger types, log facilities, loglevel policies and message
transformations.

The Alog library comes in two flavors: base and full. The base build
includes facilities to log to files and syslog while the full version
provides more advanced log facilities like SMTP, Jabber/XMPP or PostgreSQL.
The full version requires AWS (Ada Web Server) and APQ (Ada95 database
binding) and are offered as non-default option.
