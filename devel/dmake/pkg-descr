dmake is different from other versions of Make in that it supports
significant enhancements.

The original author(s) were WTICorp.com, but they appear to have lost
interest in maintaining the code.

This port installs the version currently maintained by OpenOffice
project. Unfortunately, OOo does not offer dmake as an independent
download, but, fortunately, the folks at Debian do.
