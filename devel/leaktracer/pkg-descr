LeakTracer is a small tool for checking a C++ program for memory leaks.

To use LeakTracer, run your program using the provided LeakCheck script.  It
uses the LD_PRELOAD feature to "overlay" some functions on top of your
functions (no recompile needed).

LeakTracer uses gdb to print out the exact line where the memory was allocated
and not freed -- this of course means you have to free all dynamically
allocated data.  LeakTracer also overrides the global operator new and operator
delete -- this will give problems if you override them as well.

LeakTracer traces only new/new[] and delete calls -- it does not look at
malloc/free/realloc.
