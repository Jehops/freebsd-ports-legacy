This is a libg++ add-on for EGCS releases and later GCC releases.
It is needed only if your applications depend on
libg++ and you cannot easily remove the dependency on libg++.

Note that the stand-alone libg++ is no longer needed and this package is no
longer being maintained.  Because libg++ is no longer being actively
maintained you should not start new C++ projects using libg++.
