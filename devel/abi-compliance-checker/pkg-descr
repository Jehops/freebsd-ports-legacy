Given the header files and shared objects corresponding to two different shared
library versions, and a simple description of each of the shared libraries in
XML format, abi-compliance-checker searches for the following kinds of binary
compatibility problems:

--Added/withdrawn interfaces (functions, global variables)
--Problems in Data Types:
	--Classes: added/withdrawn virtual functions (changes in layout of
		virtual table), virtual function positions, virtual function
		redefinitions
	--Structural data types: added/withdrawn members (changes in layout of
		type structure),
		changes in members, size changes
	--Enumerations: member value changes
--Interface problems:
	--Parameters and return type changes
	--Static property changes

The checker then generates a report that assesses the risks of any potential
problems detected.
