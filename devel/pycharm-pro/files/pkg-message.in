1. There is experimental native (faster) file watching support which is
disabled by default.  Currently there are problems with watching large
trees.  To enable, edit %%DATADIR%%/bin/idea.properties and append

  idea.filewatcher.disabled=false
  idea.filewatcher.executable.path=%%IDEA_HOME%%/bin/fsnotifier

Only enable fsnotifier if your projects have < 600 files.

2. Should you experience dialog boxes not accepting keyboard input (eg.
Navigate | File) than set the custom property action.aware.typeAhead=false in
Help | Edit Custom Properties.

3. Some bundled and third party plugins depend on OpenJFX. For JDK11, the SDK
version this PyCharm port depends on, FreeBSD does not yet have an OpenJFX port
available. Hence these plugins will not work! 

An example of that is the bundled, and by default enabled, reStructuredText
plugin. As a result, clicking on a *.rst file does not seem to do anything. To
verify that the missing OpenJFX library is indeed the culprit, from within
PyCharm: 

    Open: Help | Show log in <your file manager>
    Open: idea.log
    Scroll to the end (timestamp matching attempt to open *.rst file)
    Look for: 'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/embed/swing/JFXPanel'

A workaround is to simply disable the reStructuredText plugin in File |
Settings | Plugins. It will allow *.rst to be opened and editted in the default
text editor.
