The OSKit is a framework and a set of component libraries oriented to operating
systems, together with extensive documentation. By providing in a modular way
not only most of the infrastructure "grunge" needed by an OS, but also many
higher-level components, the OSKit's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to
OS R&D and to lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new
OS, port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other architectures
supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS  to support a wider range of devices,
file system formats, executable formats, or network services. The OSKit also
works well for constructing OS-related programs, such as boot loaders or
OS-level servers atop a microkernel.
