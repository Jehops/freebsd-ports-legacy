Str - Generic String Library
Copyright (c) 1999-2000 Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>

The Str library is a generic string library written in ANSI C which
provides functions for handling, matching, parsing, searching and
formatting of C strings. So it can be considered as a superset of POSIX
string(3), but its main intention is to provide a more convinient and
compact API plus a more generalized functionality.
