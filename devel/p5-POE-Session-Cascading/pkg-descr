POE::Session::Cascading provides a stack-like session for POE.  Another
way of saying it is that a Cascading session is like a big switch
statement.  In the above example, when state1 is called in session foo,
&state1 gets executed.  When it finishes, state2 gets fired and &state2
gets executed.  If state2 is called in session foo, only state2 will get
executed.
