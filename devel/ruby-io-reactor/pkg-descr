This module is a pure-Ruby implementation of an asynchronous
multiplexed IO Reactor which is based on the Reactor design pattern
found in _Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 2: Patterns
for Concurrent and Networked Objects_. It allows a single thread to
demultiplex and dispatch events from one or more IO objects to an
appropriate handler.
