Understand for Ada can't be used without a license code.

You need a limited time period license to run the product in
evaluation mode. One can be obtained in the www site.

A permanent license can be purchased there, too.

The Understand_ada program will try to write a license file under
/usr/local/share/understand_ada/license when you register it.

Registration instructions:

1) Make sure that the user running Understand_ada when entering the
registration code has proper permissions to create files under
/usr/local/share/understand_ada/license when your register it.
Understand_ada will try to create a file under this directory to save
the registration information. This applies for both evaluation and
permanent licenses.

2) Verify that the files created under
/usr/local/share/understand_ada/license are accessible by all users
who will be using Understand_ada. Usually ''chmod -R a=r+X
/usr/local/share/understand_ada/license'' will do.
