Understand for Ada is an IDE tool offering reverse engineering,
automatic documentation, code navigation, metrics, maintenance and
cross reference tool for Ada 83 and Ada 95 source code. It is
designed to help engineers who have inherited large amounts of Ada
legacy code, or whose Ada projects have grown to immense size or
complexity. The tool offers incremental analysis (parsing) of only
changed source code, detailed graphical reverse engineering, highly
interactive cross referencing, and detailed automatic documentation
via HTML output. All parsing is compiler independent - Understand
for Ada uses it's own Ada parser designed for its kind of analysis.
   
Views include call (invocation) trees, callby trees, generic
instantiation trees, with trees, with-by trees, Ada Structure Graphs
(ASG), colorized source browsing/editing, quick and smart project
wide string searching and detailed HTML/text documentation of
analysis information. Additional custom reporting/documentation
can be developed using the PERL interface to Understand for Ada's
database.

You need a limited time period license to run the product in
