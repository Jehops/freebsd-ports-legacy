Configuring LXR
===============

First-time installation
-----------------------

For the first-time installations you should copy the template files
for LXR to your installation

 cp %%LXRDIR%%/templates/* %%LXRDIR%%/

Then you should glance over configuration file at
 %%LXRDIR%%/lxr.conf

It has some reasonable values for the helper programs, but you should
customize variables like 'baseurl', 'virtroot' and others.

Upgrades
--------

You should look at the contents of the directory
 %%LXRDIR%%/templates/
and possibly merge new stuff from it to the corresponding files in
 %%LXRDIR%%/


Happy cross-referencing and code mining!
