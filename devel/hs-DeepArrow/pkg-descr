This Haskell library provides a framework for type-directed composition
of value editors (non-syntactic transformations). The tools enable "deep
function application" in two senses: deep application of functions and
application of deep functions. These tools generalize beyond values and
functions, via the DeepArrow subclass of the Arrow type class.
