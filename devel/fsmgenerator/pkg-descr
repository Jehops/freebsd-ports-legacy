Similarly to the Finite Automata model in Computer Science, Finite State
Machine model finds its widest use in Software Engineering. As a software
development design pattern, FSM occurs in many software solutions, but unlike
most of its pattern counterparts, FSM requires substantial time for manual
implementation. But the really devastating part of manual implementation is
usually in its increasing cost of change and maintenance. All of the above
considerations eventually converge to a necessity of automatic, fault-free FSM
generation.
