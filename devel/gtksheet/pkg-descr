GtkSheet is a matrix widget for GTK+. It consists of an scrollable grid of
cells where you can allocate text which can be edited interactively. It is
also a container subclass, allowing you to display buttons, curves, pixmaps
and any other widget in it. You can also set many attributes as: border,
foreground and background color, text justification, and more. GtkSheet comes
also with an extra set of useful widgets and a demo program showing all of
them interacting in a spreadsheet-like GUI. 

This distribution includes the following set of widgets:

* GtkSheet
* GtkSheetEntry
* GtkComboBox
* GtkColorCombo
* GtkBorderCombo

and a demo program showing their features.
