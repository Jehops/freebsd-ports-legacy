SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as
building blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and
visualization applications.

SimGear is a relatively new project, and while quite a bit of code has
been written in conjunction with the FlightGear project, the final
interface and arrangements are still evolving.

The term "Simulation Kernel" is a bit presumptuous for us at this
point, but this is the direction we are heading with SimGear.
