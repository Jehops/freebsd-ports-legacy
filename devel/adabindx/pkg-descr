This is a binding of Ada to the C-Libraries of the X Window system and the
Motif(tm) or Lesstif widget set.

Programmers used to write X Window programs will easily use this binding. Most
of the names for functions and procedures resemble the equivalent C interface
names, e.g.
   XGetRGBColormaps (C interface) <-> X_Get_RGB_Colormaps (Ada binding).

"While retaining familiarity to the C interface, I tried to include the
security of Ada by controlling the creation and release of pointer types
wherever possible."
