This is a binding of Ada to the C-Libraries of the X Window system and the
Motif(tm) or Lesstif widget set.

Programmers used to write X Window programs will easily use this binding. Most
of the names for functions and procedures resemble the equivalent C interface
names, e.g.
   XGetRGBColormaps (C interface) <-> X_Get_RGB_Colormaps (Ada binding).

"While retaining familiarity to the C interface, I tried to include the
security of Ada by controlling the creation and release of pointer types
wherever possible."

Patch supplied by Vadim Godunko

It adds support for OpenMotif 2.2 to configuration as well as support for
XmColumn, XmDataField and widgets from OpenMotif2.2.
