freescope is a programmer tool that provides source code browsing on
UNIX-like operating systems. It is a clone of the cscope program but
has its own unique features such as symbol completion and easy result
browsing.

freescope is currently limited to building a symbol database for C
source files only but has been designed and implemented with
extensibility in mind. This should lead in the next future in new
capabilities for parsing new programming languages such as C++, Java,
Pascal, etc. 

freescope supports currently 7 different queries. These are: 

   - Search for a symbol occurences 
   - Search for a global definition 
   - Search for calls to a given function 
   - Search for text occurences 
   - Search for regular expression occurences 
   - Search for a file 
   - Search for inclusions of the given file 

Note that these queries can be extended to most programming languages.
