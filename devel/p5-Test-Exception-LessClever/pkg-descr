Test::Exception::LessClever is an alternative to Test::Exception that is much
simpler. This alternative does not use fancy stack tricks to hide itself. The
idea here is to keep it simple. This also solves the Test::Exception bug where
some dies will be hidden when a DESTROY method calls eval. If a DESTROY method
masks $@ a warning will be generated as well.
