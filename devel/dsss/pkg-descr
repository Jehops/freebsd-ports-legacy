DSSS, the D Shared Software System, builds upon rebuild and intends
to create a standardized system for building, installing, configuring,
acquiring and using D software, licensed as Free and Open Source
Software under the MIT license. One notable component of it is its
net module, which provides an analogue to Perl's CPAN or Ruby's
Gems for the D programming language.
