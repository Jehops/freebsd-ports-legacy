Go-Json-Rest is a thin layer on top of net/http that helps building RESTful
JSON APIs easily. It provides fast URL routing using a Trie based
implementation, and helpers to deal with JSON requests and responses. It is
not a high-level REST framework that transparently maps HTTP requests
to procedure calls, on the opposite, you constantly have access to the
underlying net/http objects.
