A portable extension that provides the power of OpenSSL to Tcl programs.
This extension can be used to utilize SSL encryption on top of any valid
Tcl Channel - not just sockets!

Note,  that Scriptics  has released  this newer  version (1.4),  but the
author's web-site listed below still only lists 1.3.
