Paraphrasing the website:

  ORBit-C++ provides C++ bindings for ORBit, an open source CORBA
  2.2-compliant Object Request Broker.

  The primary objectives of ORBit-C++ are:
  - To provide a spec-compliant C++ CORBA mapping for ORBit.
  - To allow programmers to use and write ORBit objects and gnome components
    in C++ with little or no runtime overhead (compared to writing C ones)
  - To allow C programmers to use C++ objects without having to deal with any
    of that "horrible C++ syntax".

  In short, to C++ programmers, all ORBit objects look like C++ objects, and
  to C programmers, all ORBit objects should look like C objects.
