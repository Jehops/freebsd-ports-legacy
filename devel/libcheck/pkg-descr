Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
source code editors and IDEs.

Check was inspired by similar frameworks that currently exist for most
programming languages; the most famous example being JUnit for Java
(www.junit.org). There is a list of unit test frameworks for multiple
languages at www.xprogramming.com/software.htm . Unit testing has a
long history as part of formal quality assurance methodologies, but
has recently been associated with the lightweight methodology called
Extreme Programming. In that methodology, the characteristic practice
involves interspersing unit test writing with coding (" test a little,
code a little"). While the incremental unit test/code approach is
indispensable to Extreme Programming, it is also applicable, and
perhaps indispensable, outside of that methodology.
