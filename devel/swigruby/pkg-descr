Swigruby is the Ruby module for SWIG 1.1.

SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) is an interface compiler that connects
programs written in C and C++ with scripting languages. This module
extends SWIG to produce wrapper code for Ruby.

Note that swigruby was merged into SWIG 1.3 and you don't need to
install this package if you use SWIG 1.3 or later.
