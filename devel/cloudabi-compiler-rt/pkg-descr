The compiler-rt library provides fallback routines for mathematical
functions that are not implemented in hardware. For example, when
compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit unsigned
integer is compiling into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi" function.

This library is a prerequisite for having a working CloudABI toolchain,
as Clang attempts to link this library into executables unconditionally.
