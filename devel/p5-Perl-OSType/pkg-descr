Modules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if the
current operating system matches a more generic type of operating
systems.  For example, 'linux' is a type of 'Unix' operating system and
so is 'freebsd'.

This module provides a mapping between an operating system name as given
by $^O and a more generic type.
