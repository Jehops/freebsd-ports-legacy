As80 is a lightweight 8080/8085 assembler for UN*X systems. It was
developed on a Debian GNU/Linux System and should well work on other
UN*Xes. As80 is not invoked directly but through a wrapper shell
script (asm) that handles some basic conversion (upper to lower etc.). So
be sure to use this instead of directly running as80 and getting lots of
(if you are lucky, meaningful) error messages.

Although As80 is still in a somewhat early phase of development, it
won't take much to come to one level with professional assemblers. The
use of the C preprocessor instead of implementing some of the
functionality (.EQU comes to mind) makes it easy to write assembler
source programs in a more flexible way. At least, that's what I think.
You are of course welcome to improve and/or add as you like, but be
sure to always obey the license terms.
