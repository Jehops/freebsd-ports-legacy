[sniped from readme]

 This lets you browse the "network neighbourhood" like in windows
 by entering the location smb:// in Nautilus. This lists the
 workgroups on your local network, and you can browse around servers
 and shares.

 You can also go directly to smb servers by entering the location
 smb://server/, where server is the NMB (windows) name, the dns name
 or the ip address. By using ip you can reach machines outside your
 local subnet.

 If the password popup doesn't appear you can use:
 smb://user:password@server/share/ notation.
