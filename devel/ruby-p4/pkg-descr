P4Ruby: Ruby interface to the Perforce API

P4Ruby allows you to write beautiful Ruby code that interacts with a
Perforce server.  The main features are:

    * Get Perforce data and forms in hashes and arrays
    * Edit Perforce forms by modifying hashes
    * Exception based error handling
    * Ignore warnings (like "File(s) up-to-date." on a sync)
    * Run as many commands on a connection as you want to 

Writing Ruby code is a joy for all programmers, and P4Ruby makes that
experience available to Perforce users. Enjoy it!

Note: P4Ruby is not supported by Perforce Software, but the author
below personally.
