GNU Network Object Model Environment

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-port" that depends on other GNOME 2 packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the GNOME 2 development stuff pulled in by the port/package 
dependency mechanism.
