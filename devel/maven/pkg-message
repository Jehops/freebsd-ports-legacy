To work with Maven you need to set the following environment variables:
  * JAVA_HOME
    Set it to the base directory of your java installation.
  * MAVEN_HOME
    Set it to ``/usr/local/share/java/maven''.

Then, you should initialize your repository with:
  /usr/local/share/java/maven/bin/install_repo.sh ~/.maven/repository
