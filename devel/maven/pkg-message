To work with Maven you need to set the following environment variable:
  * JAVA_HOME
    Set it to the base directory of your java installation.

Then, you should initialize your repository with:
  %%DATADIR%%/bin/install_repo.sh ~/.maven/repository

If you are behind a proxy, create a ~/.mavenrc file with something like:
  MAVEN_OPTS="$MAVEN_OPTS -Dmaven.proxy.host=YOUR_PROXY_HOSTNAME
    -Dmaven.proxy.port=YOUR_PROXY_PORT"
