  WARNING: if the lang/ghc port doesn't install the hyperlinkable
  documentation for its libraries, then haddock can't know about
  these. But also in this case haddock can't handle recursive
  modules currently.
  In general haddock detects and reports as an error recursive
  modules and emits chatting warnings listing all the identifiers
  it couldn't resolve.
