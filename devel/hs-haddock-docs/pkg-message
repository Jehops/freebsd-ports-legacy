  WARNING: if the lang/ghc port doesn't install the hyperlinkable
  documentation for its libraries, then haddock can't know about
  these. But also in this case haddock can't handle recursive
  modules currently, so the lang/ghc port can't install the
  hyperlinkable documentation of the HSghc libraries, and then
  haddock can't know about these last.
  In general haddock detects and reports as an error recursive
  modules and emits chatting warnings listing all the identifiers
  it couldn't resolve.
