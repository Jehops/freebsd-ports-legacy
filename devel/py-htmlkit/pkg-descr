From the web site:

	HtmlKit is a free, open source Python package that assists in the
	dynamic generation of HTML content. HtmlKit was inspired by HTMLgen
	and uses it's basic design ideas:

	    objects for HTML primatives 
	    overriding "__str__" to allow these objects behave as strings 

	but with a flexible and simplified rendering framework.
	HtmlKit is compatible with HTMLgen and most projects can fairly easily
	switch between or use both packages.
