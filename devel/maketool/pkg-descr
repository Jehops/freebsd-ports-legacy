Maketool is a simple GTK+ based GUI front-end for GNU make and other make
programs.

Maketool's features include:

  * Figures out what targets are available and presents them in a menu.
  * Runs make and detects compiler errors and warnings in the output.
  * Double-clicking on errors starts an editor with that file and line.
  * Works with any makefile system that uses GNU make.
  * Automatically updates Makefile if project uses automake, autoconf or imake.
  * GUI for selecting configure options for automake and autoconf.
  * Special handling for standard GNU targets such as all, install, clean etc.
  * Save and reload logs of make runs.
  * Summarise make logs to reduce visual clutter.
  * With recursive make, expand or collapse each directory separately
  * Override values of make and environment variables.
  * Make in series or in parallel, (using make's -j and -l flags).
  * Dryrun mode (using make's -n flag).
  * Implements many of make's command-line options.
  * Configure foreground & background colours of error & warnings lines.
  * Now also supports Solaris make, IRIX smake, and BSD pmake.
