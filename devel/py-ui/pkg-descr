PyUI is a user interface library written entirely in the high-level language
python. It has a modular implementation that allows the drawing and event
input to be performed by pluggable "renderers". This makes PyUI very portable
and scalable. It can run in environments from hardware accelerated 3D surfaces
to regular desktop windows. PyUI was originally targeted as a User Interface
for games, but it has evolved into a more general UI toolkit with
applicability outside of games.

The goal of pyui is that is be very simple to use and that the implementation
be kept as simple as possible. Some lessons learned from Extreme Programming
are being applied to the development process. The current state of PyUI is no
longer exactly simple as it evolves towards being a fully features GUI
toolkit, but the development methodology has been successful in keeping the
code stable and usable throughout its life so far.
