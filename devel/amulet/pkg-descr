Amulet is a toolkit for building graphical user interfaces in C++.

This port builds three versions of the library:
  libamulet.so.3.0:         shared library with the inspector
			    (for development)
  libamulet-release.so.3.0: shared library without the inspector
  libamulet-release.a:      static version of the above library

In addition, the following programs are installed in /usr/X11R6/bin:
  gilt:         the interface designer
  agate:        gesture training program

The sample programs are installed in /usr/X11R6/share/amulet/samples.

There is also a sample Makefile (sample.Makefile) in that directory
that you can use to build amulet programs. This is an adaption
of the Makefiles that come with amulet, which does not require the 
AMULET_DIR and AMULET_VARS_FILE to be set.
