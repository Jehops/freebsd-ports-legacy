   SVr4 and XSI-Curses compatible curses library and terminfo
tools including tic, infocmp, captoinfo.  The library can
be configured to fall back to reading /etc/termcap for
backward compatibility with BSD curses, but the distribution
includes a copy of the master terminfo database.  Supports
color, multiple highlights, forms-drawing characters, and
automatic recognition of keypad and function-key sequences.
   Approved to replace 4.4BSD curses.
