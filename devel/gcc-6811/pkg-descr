This is a 6811 cross compiler for FreeBSD.
From the original README...

    The following are some comments and instructions on the 6811 port of the
    gnu gcc compiler done by Coactive Aesthetics.

    The port was written using the GCB11 Network Microcontroller board that
    is manufactured by Coactive Aesthetics. It was hosted on a NeXT system.
    However, there is no assumptions and/or hardcode values within the
    compiler which would prevent the compiler from working on any 6811 board
    or on any host system. A port to another board would require an updated
    crt0.s file which defines where the "pseudo" registers live in the memory
    map and where the startup code lives. A sample crt0.s file has been
    included as part of this release.

    The rest of this readme file has some technical notes relating to the
    port, and installation procedures that can be used in installing the
    compiler.

    Any questions, bug reports, or porting comments/questions should be sent
    to gcc@coactive.com.

    Thanks,

    Otto

You'll probably have to edit ${PREFIX}/lib/gcc-lib/m6811-local/2.6.3/crt0.s
to suit your hardware.
