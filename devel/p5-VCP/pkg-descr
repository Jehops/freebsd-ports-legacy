vcp is a tool for copying revision controlled files between various SCM
repositories.  For example, using vcp, it is possible to copy the contents
of a entire Perforce depot (or part of one) into a depot on a different
Perforce server or to copy the contents of a CVS repository into a Perforce
server (or vice-versa).
