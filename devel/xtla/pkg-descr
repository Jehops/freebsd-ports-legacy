xtla is a very complete Emacs front-end for tla. The main features are

     * PCL-CVS like interface for tla inventory
     * Archive browser. Navigate painlessly in archives, categories,
       branches, versions, ...
     * Good integration in Emacs. Almost everything can be done from
       within the editor
     * Bookmark manager. Keep the most frequently used arch locations
       in your bookmark buffer.
     * Integration of ediff, Emacs's graphical diff tool. (Even
       outside xtla it's great, you should try it
            To view changes made in a local tree
            To view and resolve conflicts after a merge.
     * Interface to view missing patches from all your partners with a
       single command
     * An Emacs mode for arch related files (log files,
       =tagging-method)
