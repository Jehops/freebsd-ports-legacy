This is a collection of modules that will read a <GTK-Interface> XML file 
produced by Glade (the Gtk+/Gnome UI builder), construct and optionally show 
the UI using the Gtk-Perl bindings. It is possible, using Glade from version 
0.5.0, for you to specify a language of 'Perl' and generate source code from 
Glade's 'Build' button.
