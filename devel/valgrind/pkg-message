	Known problems:
	1) DRD valgrind tool does not work.
	2) Helgrind tool gives excessive false-positivies for the
	   internals of pthreads library.  This is now under
	   investigation.
	3) 32 bit binaries under amd64 are not supported currently.
	   Work is being done to get it working.

	If you'll encounter any problems when using Valgrind do not
	hesitate to contact the maintainer with the description of
	these problems.
