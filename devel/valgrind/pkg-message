Note: This version of valgrind does not support some older AMD processors.
      If valgrind crashes immediately after it was started with the error
      message "Illegal hardware instruction", your processor is affected by
      this problem.

      As a workaround you can use the devel/valgrind-snapshot port, which is
      based on a more recent snapshot
