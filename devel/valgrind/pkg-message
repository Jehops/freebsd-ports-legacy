Note: This version of valgrind does not support some older processors, 
      e.g. AMD K6-III, some (?) Pentium II.

      If valgrind crashes immediately after it was started with the error
      message "Illegal hardware instruction", your processor is affected by
      this problem.

      As a workaround you can use the devel/valgrind-snapshot port, which is
      based on a more recent snapshot.
