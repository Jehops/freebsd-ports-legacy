 # Step 1: edit BINDIR to reflect where you want to put perltidy
 # This is fairly standard:
-BINDIR	= /usr/local/bin
+BINDIR	= %%PREFIX%%/bin
 
 # Step 2: edit MANDIR to reflect where you want to put the man page, perltidy.1
 # or comment out MANDIR to skip installing a man page.
 # (Man pages can be found on the web at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net)
 #
 # Note: The value of MANDIR varies a lot, so be sure to check this.

 # Step 3: Then become superuser (if necessary) and issue the command
 # make install
