Don't forget to compile and run verification/validation code: gmake check-all
or specifically, sub-targets
	vmyenv vendian_io vendian_io_ext vhistogram varithm
	vTCPstream vTCPstream_server vvoc
	
See comments in the work/cppadvio/Makefile for details, as well as
c++serv.dr.  The verification code checks to see that all the
functions in this package have compiled and run well. The validation
code can also serve as an illustration of how package's classes and
functions may be employed.
