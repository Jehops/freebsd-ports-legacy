This is a port of the bulk of the Plan 9 software build environment to Unix.
It tries to reproduce the Plan 9 build environment as faithfully as possible,
providing u.h and libc.h, and blithely redefining tokens such as open, dup,
and accept in order to provide implementations that better mimic the Plan 9
semantics.  The result is a somewhat more complicated and less Unix-friendly
environment, but Plan 9 programs can typically be compiled with little or no
changes.

The port includes the following:

  - Sources for Linux, FreeBSD, and SunOS

  - lib9 (nee libc), libString, libbin, libbio, libcomplete, libdraw,
    liblibflate, frame, libfs, libhtml, libhttpd, libip, libmux, libplumb,
    liblibregexp, libsec, thread, and libventi

  - 9term, acme, hoc, plumber, rio (nee 9wm), sam, and samterm, along with
    many small utilities and manual pages

  - Plan 9 bitmap fonts
