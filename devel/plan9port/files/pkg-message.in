You should benefit from adding these to your profile environment:

	PLAN9=%%PREFIX%%/plan9; export PLAN9
	PATH=$PATH:$PLAN9/bin; export PATH

This port can install a default plumbing file if you want.  Just go to the
port's directory and type (being your normal user):

	make install-user

BEWARE:  This port can cause some problems if you try install certain
software (including, but not limited to our Ports Collection):

  - Ports that require `archivers/zip' to build (e.g. `www/mozilla').  If
   `$PLAN9/bin/zip' would be found as `zip' command (via $PATH) and used,
    it could easily fail since does not share options with "standard" `zip'

  - `x11/kdebase3' build can result in crash in `fish.cpp' file if you try
    to build it with $PLAN9.  We suggest you to unset $PLAN9 before building
    any other ports that fail with similar symptoms (or unset it for all
    ports just to be on the safe side)

  - venti/fmt* commands work only with normal files
