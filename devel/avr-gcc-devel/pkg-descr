FSF gcc-4.3.x for Atmel AVR cross-development

Included is the basic C++ compiler, although this is only of limited
use without a libstdc++, and it is little tested.

Locally added support for the following AVR devices:

ATmega32C1, ATmega32M1, ATmega32U4
ATtiny167
ATxmega64A1, ATxmega128A1

The binaries are installed with a -43 exec file suffix so they do not
collide with the binaries from the devel/avr-gcc port.
