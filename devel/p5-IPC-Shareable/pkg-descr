    IPC::Shareable allows you to tie a a variable to shared memory making
    it easy to share the contents of that variable with other Perl
    processes. Currently either scalars or hashes can be tied; tying of
    arrays remains a work in progress. However, the variable being tied may
    contain arbitrarily complex data structures - including references to
    arrays, hashes of hashes, etc. See the "REFERENCES" entry in this
    manpage below for more information.
