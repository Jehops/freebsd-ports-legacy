Debug module to find where perl objects (or arrays, hashes and globs)
are created by checking for objects passed to and/or returned from subs,
and monitoring when they are destroyed via destructor subs.  This can
help detect memory leaks caused by objects being left behind in your
programs when they shouldn't be.

The main output is stored in a file which logs the first time a memory
reference is seen with datetime, current session number (starts at 1),
object type, call stack etc., and whether the object was first seen
returned from a sub or passed as an argument.  Details are also logged
whenever an object is destroyed.  This includes the datetime, session
and call stack when the object was created.

The subroutine Devel::ObjectTracker::output_details outputs details on
the currently existing objects on demand.  These details contain
date/time, session, call stack, etc. when the object was created.
