Moonshine Open Source Edition is a customizable integrated software development
enviropment that supports a wide variety of languages. It is designed in a
modular fashion so that specific language support is not built directly into
the application but into plug-ins or modules. The application provides a source
tree browser, a configurable text editor, and a captured commands interface.
The individual modules provide icons, menus, help files, context highlighting
rules for text, and utilities specific to the module.
