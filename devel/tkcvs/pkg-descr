TkCVS is a cross-platform, TCL/Tk-based GUI for the CVS configuration
management system. It displays the status of the files in the current
working directory, and provides buttons and menus to execute CVS
commands on the selected files. The Module Browser extends CVS with
facilities for a user-friendly listing of modules in the repository.
TkDiff is included for browsing and merging your changes.
