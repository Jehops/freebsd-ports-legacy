Bazaar is an implementation of GNU arch in C from canonical. Arch is a version
control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files and directories
(usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc.,
like SVN, CVS, or RCS. Arch is distributed, which gives it significant
advantages and some disadvantages compared to SVN and CVS.
