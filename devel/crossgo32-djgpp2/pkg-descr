This ports installs the DJGPP Version 2 libraries and stub utilities
into the crossgo32 cross compiler port. The original libraries built
by the crossgo32 port are moved aside until you run pkg_delete to
un-install this port. 

The DJGPP libraries create larger binaries for smaller programs but
this is less of an issue with larger programs.

Two new utilities - i386-go32-stubify and i386-go32-stubedit - are
also installed. It is no longer necessary to stubify the COFF binaries
as a patch is included to do this automatically after
compilation. Please refer to the DJGPP v2 FAQ for further information
on this topic.

Finally, this port also allows us to install a number of extra
toolkits from the DJGPP collection.

Share and enjoy,
