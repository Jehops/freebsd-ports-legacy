cvslines extends the capability of the cvs commit command, to provide 
extra support in managing multiple concurrent lines of development.

cvslines is a "wrapper" facility that helps out with merging changes
between various cvs branches, where the branches represent different
lines of development.

For more information about using cvslines, see cvslines(1).
