[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

Alleyoop is a graphical front-end to the increasingly popular
Valgrind memory checker for x86 GNU/Linux using the Gtk+ widget
set and other GNOME libraries for the X-Windows environment.

Features include a right-click context menu to intelligently suppress
errors or launch an editor on the source file/jumping to the exact
line of the error condition. A searchbar at the top of the viewer
can be used to limit the viewable errors to those that match the
regex criteria entered. Also included is a fully functional
Suppressions editor.
