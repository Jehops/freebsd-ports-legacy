AutoDia is a modular application that parses source code or data (if a
handler is available) and produces an XML document in Dia format,
essentially a Dia diagram autocreation package. The diagrams its creates
are standard UML diagrams showing dependancies, superclasses, packages,
classes and inheritances, as well as the methods, etc of each class.

AutoDia supports any language that a Handler has been written for -
currently this is C++, DBI, Java, PHP, Perl, Python, SQL and Torque (XML
DB schema).
Adding a handler is easy - read the DEVELOP file for details.
