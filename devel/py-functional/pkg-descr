A Python module which provides support for a functional style of Python
programming.

It includes support for closures, curried functions, lazy expressions,
lazy tuples (functional programming languages call these lazy lists, but
since lists are mutable in Python, tuples are closer in meaning), and
lazy equivalents for map, filter, reduce, and zip. Also includes some
higher-order functions for composing functions and such.

To use, just

   import functional
