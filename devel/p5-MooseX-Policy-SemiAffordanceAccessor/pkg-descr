This class while loading changes the default naming policy for the
package so that accessors are separated into get and set methods.  The
get methods have the same name as the accessor, while set methods are
prefixed with "set_".

If you define an attribute with a leading underscore, then the set
method will start with "_set_".

If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name when creating an
attribute, then this policy skips that attribute.
