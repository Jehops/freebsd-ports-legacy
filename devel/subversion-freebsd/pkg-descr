Subversion is a version control system designed to be as similar to cvs(1) 
as possible, while fixing many outstanding problems with cvs(1).

This version adds patches that at this time are specific to the needs of
the FreeBSD Project src repository.  If you do not need to access that
repository you will want to use devel/subversion.
