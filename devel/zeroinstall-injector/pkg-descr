A running process is created by combining many different libraries
(and other components). In the Zero Install world, we have all
versions of each library available at all times. The problem then
is how to choose which versions to use.

The injector solves this problem by selecting components to meet a
program's requirements, according to a policy you give it. The
injector finds out which versions are available, and downloads and
runs the ones you choose.
