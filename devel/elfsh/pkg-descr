For impatient people, this is a short list for libelfsh's already 
provided features: Mass file view with nice output and cross 
references, unlink/relink the file, modify sections and program 
header parameter fields, hijack GOT, CTORS, DTORS, modify the symbol 
table, inject and remove symbols, inject sections, remove SHT, 
support binaries without symtab, reconstruct the SHT. Look at 
libelfsh-ref.txt for current libelfsh reference. elfsh offers an 
attractive interface to libelfsh.
