This is the set of utility classes used by Myghty templating. Included
are:

container - the Containment system providing back-end neutral
key/value storage, with support for in-memory, DBM files, flat files,
and memcached

buffer - some functions for augmenting file objects

util - various utility functions and objects

synchronizer - provides many reader/single writer synchronization
using either thread mutexes or lockfiles

session - provides a Session interface built upon the Container,
similar interface to mod_python session. Currently needs a
mod_python-like request object, this should be changed to something
more generic.
