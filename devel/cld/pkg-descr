A port from the CLD (Compact Language Detector) library embedded in
Google's Chromium browser.  The library detects the language from
provided UTF8 text (plain text or HTML).  It's implemented in C++,
with very basic Python bindings.

You most likely need devel/cld2 port: version 2 of CLD.  This port is here
only to for pecl-cld until it support CLD version 2.
