The Ada 95 version of the components will contain the same key abstractions
as the C++ form (Structs, Tools and Support). However, the organization will
be slightly different, particularly in the Support domain. This is because
Ada 95 provides several special forms of memory management that are quite
different from C++.

The Structs category provides an array of structural abstractions (Bags,
Collections, Deques, Graphs, Lists, Maps, Queues, Rings, Sets, Stacks, and
Trees). The Tools category provides algorithmic abstractions (Searching,
Sorting, etc.). The Support category contains all the "concrete" forms, plus
structures to create the components.

Some of the structures permit structural sharing (graphs, lists, and trees).
Some structures may also be ordered (collections, dequeues, and queues). There
are also multiple forms for some structures: single and double linked lists,
directed and undirected graphs, and binary, multiway, and AVL trees.
