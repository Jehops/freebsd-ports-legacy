BSDBuild is a simple, self-contained and portable build system derived from the
traditional 4.4BSD share/mk files. BSDBuild uses BSD-style makefiles, but
without BSD make extensions (it uses standard Bourne script fragments instead),
so the build system is portable to most operating systems and make flavors.
Because BSDBuild is implemented as a library, makefiles are edited directly and
never need to be "regenerated".
