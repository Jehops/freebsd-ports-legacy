Note : A sample suppression file was installed to \
       %%PREFIX%%/lib/valgrind/freebsd-default.supp.
       It makes Valgrind hide warnings caused by flawed code sequences
       -if any - in your system libraries, so that you can concentrate
       on the warnings issued for your own code.

       To use these suppressions, either pass
       --suppressions=%%PREFIX%%/lib/valgrind/freebsd-default.supp
       to Valgrind on the commandline, or add that line to your
       ~/.valgrindrc file, which is the recommended way.
