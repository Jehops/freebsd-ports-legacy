Deputy is a C compiler that is capable of preventing common C programming 
errors, including out-of-bounds memory accesses as well as many other 
common type-safety errors. 

Deputy allows C programmers to provide simple type annotations that 
describe pointer bounds and other important program invariants. 
Deputy verifies that your program adheres to these invariants through a 
combination of compile-time and run-time checking.
