Source-Navigator is a source code analysis tool. With it, you can edit your
source code, display relationships between classes and functions and members,
and display call trees. You can also build your projects, either with your
own makefile, or by using Source-Navigator's build system to automatically
generate a makefile.

Source-Navigator works with the Insight GUI interface for GDB.

Source-Navigator supports C, C++, Java, Tcl, [incr Tcl], FORTRAN,
Python and COBOL, and provides an SDK so you can write your
own parsers.

Use Source-Navigator to:
* Analyze how a change will effect external source modules. 
* Find every place in your code where a given function is called. 
* Find each file that includes a given header file. 
* Use the grep tool to search for a given string in all your source files. 

Source-Navigator is released under the GNU Public License.
