You installed RStudio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Please note that RStudio requires /proc to be mounted.

The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

and then run this command as root:
# mount /proc

In order to run RStudio Server please run:
$ sudo rserver --server-daemonize 0 --server-user nobody

and then navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your browser.

The rc script will be added later to start RStudio Server as
a service.
