kasm is a System RPL/Machine Language assembler for the Saturn microprocessor,
used in the HP48/HP49 calculators (this microprocessor is also used in other
HP calculators, but kasm is made specifically for the HP48/HP49
calculators). It uses the same syntax as the MASD compiler (found in the
MetaKernel program for HP48 calculators and in the HP49 calculator). This
syntax, which has only very small incompatibilities with the traditional
syntax (used in the HP Tools, in the GNU Tools and in JAZZ), supports a few
constructs that make the assembly language be closer to a high level
programming language. It supports all the structures (blocks, etc.) and
shortcuts (RPL, SCREEN, etc.) of the MASD compiler in the HP49G calculators.
