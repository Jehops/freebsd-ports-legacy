ORBit-Python provides Python bindings for ORBit, an open source CORBA
2.2-compliant Object Request Broker.

To paraphrase the README:

  ORBit-Python makes full use of the fact that Python is a dynamically typed
  language.  It not only does away with the need for an IDL compiler, but
  takes the dynamic approach one step further by automatically discovering
  available IDL modules and transparently loading them when the corresponding
  modules get imported.  When the IDL files are loaded, the appropriate
  objects and classes are created dynamically.

  Most of the ORBit types are implemented, with the exception of the fixed
  and long double types.  (Wide types are partially supported and currently
  experimental.)  Also, only a fairly small subset of the POA is implemented.

  Considerable effort has been taken to adhere to the Python Language Mapping
  Specification and remain compatible with other Python ORBs.
