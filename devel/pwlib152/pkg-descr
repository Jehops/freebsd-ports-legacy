PWLib is a multi-platform code library that can be used to write
applications that will compile and run on the BSD Unixes, Windows, Linux
and a few other Unix variants. It was developed by Equivalence Ltd Pty.

It is used by the OpenH323 library.

NOTE: This port does not install anything.
The ports which use pwlib all look inside their local
pwlib port directory for the library and header files
and are compiled statically.
