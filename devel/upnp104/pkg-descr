The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Software Development Kit (SDK) v1.0 for
Linux is an SDK for development of UPnP device and control point applications
for Linux.  It consists of the core UPnP protocols along with a UPnP-specific
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) parser supporting the Document Object Model
(DOM) Level 1 API and an optional, integrated mini web server for serving UPnP
related documents.

Intel is not providing support for the UPnP SDK for Linux.  Two mailing lists
for the UPnP SDK for Linux are available here:
WWW: http://upnp.sourceforge.net/

Questions and problems should be addressed on the appropriate mailing list.

If you find this SDK useful, please send an email to upnp@intel.com and let
us know.
