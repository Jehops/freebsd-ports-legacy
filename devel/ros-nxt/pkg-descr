This stack has basic interfaces for interacting with ROS and NXT. The software
in this stack is intended to run on top of the default NXT firmware provided by
LEGO.

The following is currently not ported:
- suport for communication over Bluetooth, in case if USB is not available
- the nxt_rviz_plugin package, this requires the visualization stack which
  in turn requires the NVidia CG Toolkit to be ported.
