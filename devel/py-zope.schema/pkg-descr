zope.schemas extend the notion of interfaces to detailed descriptions
of Attributes (but not methods). Every schema is an interface and
specifies the public fields of an object. A field roughly corresponds
to an attribute of a python object. But a Field provides space for at
least a title and a description. It can also constrain its value and
provide a validation method. Besides you can optionally specify
characteristics such as its value being read-only or not required.

This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python
project. It is maintained by the Zope Toolkit project.
