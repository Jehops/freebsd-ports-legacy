Prototype Makefiles is a collection of shared Makefiles which are installed
globally, and Makefile templates that can be copied into project directories
using a simple script. The shared Makefiles contain the rules for building a
project, cleaning it and making dependencies etc. The Makefile templates
contain the data that is specific for each project. This separation avoids
duplication of code in Makefiles and is therefore extremely easy to maintain
and extend.
