AVRPROG drives a simple ppi(4) parallel port programmer that allows
one to program Atmel AVR microcontrollers.  In the simplest case, the
hardware consists just of a cable connecting the respective AVR signal
lines to the parallel port (only 6 wires including power and ground).
See the website for more information on the parallel port pin
connections.
