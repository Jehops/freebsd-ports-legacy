This is a very basic tool to convert Visual Basic forms which use
the intrinsic controls to GTK C code.

The author leaves license issues regarding the use of this code
unclear; the code is freely available but has a 'NO GPL' proviso
stamped all over it. Users would be advised to contact the author
before using it.

This particular port has sped up one of my GUI side projects somewhat,
which is why I feel it should receive FreeBSD exposure.
