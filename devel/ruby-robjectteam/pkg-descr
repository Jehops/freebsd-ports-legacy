his package brings the ObjectTeams paradigm to ruby.

The ObjectTeams paradigm (see www.objectteams.org) is an aspect
oriented approach to achieve advanced separation of concerns.

ROT allows the programmer to encapsulate the interaction of a set of
objects (roles) into a compound object (the team).  Aspects can be
implemented as roles and are weaved into domain classes via a
connector at runtime (runtime weaving).  These aspects can be
explicitly activated and deactivated.
