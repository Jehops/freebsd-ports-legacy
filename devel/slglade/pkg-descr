SLglade is a S-Lang module that provides S-Lang bindings
for the libglade library. Used in conjunction with SLgtk,
it allows you to design your GUI with Glade (a GTK+ user interface builder),
save the interface description in a Glade XML file,
and then generate your S-Lang script's graphical interface
directly from the XML at runtime. This should reduce the time spent
developing SLgtk applications considerably, as it eliminates
the tedious job of writing interface-creation code by hand.

This is an update for Christopher Stawarz's SLglade module.
