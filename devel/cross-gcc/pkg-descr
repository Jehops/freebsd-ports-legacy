FSF gcc for cross-target development. This port brings C, C++ and
Objective C compilers with all target libraries (libstdc++, libsupc++,
libobjc, libssp, libgcc). Gloss and libc layer are provided through
newlib embedded C library.

It can be used to cross-compile operating system kernels (e.g. Linux, L4, etc)
for this architecture.

Use TGTARCH switch to select target architecture, and TGTABI to select ABI.
E.g. the following command will build toolchain for rtems on sparc:
% make TGTARCH=sparc TGTABI=rtems

If you encounter any problems building/using/installing this port, please
make me know. It would help to improve this port in feature.
