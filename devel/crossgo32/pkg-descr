Crossgo32 is a cross-compiler built from "gcc 2.7.2.2" which uses the
Cygnus embedded libraries to create smaller binaries. Unfortunately
there is no networking support at the moment. Binaries are created in
the COFF format and a utility is provided to convert these binaries
into DJGPPv1 exe files.

The package is composed of the following utilities:
GNU`s misc. utilities		binutils-2.7
The GNU's C Compiler		gcc-2.7.2.2  + crosspatch
Cygnus's embedded libraries	newlib-1.7.1
Cygnus's dos release utilities  dosrel-1.0

Share and enjoy,
