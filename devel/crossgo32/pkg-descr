Crossgo32 is a cross-compiler built from "gcc 2.7.2.2" which uses the
Cygnus embedded libraries to create smaller binaries. Unfortunately
there is no networking support at the moment. Binaries are created in
the COFF format and a utility is provided to convert these binaries
into DJGPPv1 exe files.

The package is composed of the following utilities:
GNU`s misc. utilities		binutils-2.7
The GNU's C Compiler		gcc-2.7.2.2  + crosspatch
Cygnus's embedded libraries	newlib-1.7.1
Cygnus's dos release utilities  dosrel-1.0


Compiling your code
===================

Compiling your code is just as easy (or should that be difficult?) as
gcc. All of the go32 compiler binaries have been installed with the
i386-go32 prefix. So, if you wanted to compile a file called "hello.c"
then you might use something like:

	i386-go32-gcc -o hello hello.c

This will produce a COFF binary called "hello". You will now need to
convert that binary into a EXE file so that it can be run on a DOS
machine. It's as easy as typing:

	 i386-go32-coff2exe hello

This will produce "hello.exe". 

To run your programs you need to have a DPMI server running and the
go32.exe & emu387 files in your DOS path. Crossgo32 binaries will work
with a range of DPMI servers - I have personally had success with
Windows 95 - and there is a server available from the DJGPP web
site. The DOS files mentioned above should be in
/usr/local/share/crossgo32 (or similar on your system). Please check
the DJGPP FAQ for more information on this topic.

Related ports 
============= 

This cross-compiler port was originally created by Pedro Giffuni using
the Cygnus cross-compiler FAQ and mailing list postings. You will find
other ports in the collection which use the same distribution. The
intention was to create a cross-compiler kit for all platforms
emulated on FreeBSD.

If you are interested in network support and DJGPP v2 exe files,
amongst other DJGPP bits and pieces, check out the crossgo32-dgjpp2
selection of ports.
