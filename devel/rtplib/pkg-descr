The RTP Library provides a high level interface for developing
applications that make use of the Real Time Transport Protocol
(RTP). This protocol was developed in the Audio/Video Working Group
of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and has been published
as RFC1889. This library is based on the most recent version of the
specification, incorporating some of the newest features, including
RTCP scalability algorithms.
