Bonobo is a set of language and system independant CORBA
interfaces for creating reusable components and creating compound
documents.

The Bonobo distribution includes a Gtk+ based implementation of the
Bonobo interfaces, enabling developers to create reusable components
and applications that can be used to form more complex documents.
