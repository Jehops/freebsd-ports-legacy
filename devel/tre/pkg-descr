TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp
matching library supporting:
 - approximate (fuzzy) matching,
 - strict standards conformance,
 - predicable and modest memory consumption,
 - wide-character and multibyte character support,
 - binary pattern and data support,
 - thread-safe implementation.

At the core of TRE is a new algorithm for regular expression matching
with submatch addressing. The algorithm uses linear worst-case time
in the length of the text being searched, and quadratic worst-case
time in the length of the used regular expression.
