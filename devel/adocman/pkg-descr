adocman is a set of perl modules and programs for performing
operations against the SourceForge.net site, currently including
basic Client operations (i.e. login/logout) and DocManager operations.

It includes the Alexandria perl module, which provides the back end
support for operations, the adocman program, which provides the
means to perform DocManager operations from the command-line or
scripts (by project developers or admins listed as DocManager
Editors), and the xml_export program, providing the means to automate
downloads of data from the XML data export facility on SourceForge.net
(by project administrators).
