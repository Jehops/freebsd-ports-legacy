GuiLoader/C++ is a C++ binding to the GuiLoader library. It is a convenience
layer that simplifies development of GuiLoader based applications written
in the C++ language by introducing exception safety, binding GTK+ objects
defined in GuiXml to C++ variables and type-safe dynamic connection to signals.
