px is a wrapper around p4. It provides all the functionality of p4
(deferring work to it) plus it extends some standard p4 commands and
adds a few new ones. If you are a Perforce user you might find these
extensions useful.

px uses p4lib.py, a Python interface to the Perforce client application.
If you are a Python programmer and script Perforce you might find this
module helpful. Currently, most common commands are supported.
