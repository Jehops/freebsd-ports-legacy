A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by the
paper "Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order
Polymorphism" by Mark P Jones, in Advanced School of Functional
Programming, 1995.

This package contains: 

 * the monad transformer class (in Control.Monad.Trans.Class)
 * concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated
   operations and functions to lift operations associated with other
   transformers.

It can be used on its own in portable Haskell code, or with the monad
classes in the mtl or monads-tf packages, which automatically lift
operations introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.
