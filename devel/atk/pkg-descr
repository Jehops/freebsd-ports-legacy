Accessibility means helping people with disabilities to participate in
substantial life activities. That includes work, and the use of services,
products, and information. GNOME includes libraries and a support framework
that allow people with disabilities to utilize all of the functionality of the
GNOME user environment.

The GNOME Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) describes a set of interfaces that need
to be implemented by GUI components to make them accessible. The interfaces are
toolkit-independent-- implementations could be written for any widget set, such
as GTK, Motif or Qt.
