Glipper is a clipboardmanager for the GNOME Panel. It maintains a history of
text copied to the clipboard from which you can choose. You can see this as a
GNOME counterpart to KDE's Klipper.

Glipper uses plugins to give the user all the extra functionality they want,
including support for Actions, Snippets and No-Paste services.
