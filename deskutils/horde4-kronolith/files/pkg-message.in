**************************************************************************
Kronolith has been installed in %%HORDIR%% with your
blank configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see `pkg_info -Dx horde-base'.

Then you have to create some tables from the SQL scripts in
%%HORDIR%%/scripts/sql.

Finally, you must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
configuration.
