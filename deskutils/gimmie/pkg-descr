    o All devices, printers, mapped network shares, and system settings
 * Show open conversations, opened documents, and running applications (both
   new and legacy) in the Gimmie Bar
 * Bookmark apps, documents, and people in the Gimmie Bar for quick access
 * Allow log out, shutdown, or switching to another user
