The goal of kdissert is to help to structure ideas and concepts by
associating them into a tree. The tree is there to help to see how the
ideas interact, and then to develop them further (add ramifications).

An idea is represented by a shape which can be a text or a picture. The
ideas can be connected, but there is a constraint : an idea cannot have
more than one parent.

A kdissert mind-map can be exported as a picture, or used to generate
documents. Templates include pdflatex (article, book) and html file
formats.
