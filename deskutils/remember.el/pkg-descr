"Remember" is a mode for remembering data.  It uses whatever back-end
is appropriate to record and correlate the data, but its main
intention is to allow you to express as _little_ structure as possible
up front.  If you later want to express more powerful relationships
between your data, or state assumptions that were at first too
implicit to be recognized, you can "study" the data later and
rearrange it.  But the initial "just remember this" impulse should be
as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as possible.

You can use Remember.el to add note to planner.el "on the fly".
