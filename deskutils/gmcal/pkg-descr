This is a very early release of a GTK+ app that can display your
calendar and appointment either via mstore or ICAP protocol drivers.
You may create these calendars with mcal (see deskutils/mcal).

The use of this should only be considered for testing and development.
It still has much work left before it is a stable production application.
