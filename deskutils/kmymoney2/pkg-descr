KMyMoney2 - The Personal Finances Manager for KDE

 KMyMoney2 is specifically aimed at the typical home user at present.
 The current version provides the basis for manipulating accounts that contain
transactions. Each account belongs to an institution and can be reconciled to 
balance your transactions.
 QIF import and export is supported within accounts so KMyMoney2 can read
files exported from other programs and when downloaded from online banking
institutions.
 A search dialog is also provided to let the user find transactions that
match specific criteria such as the amount.
Support for Categories and Payees are also provided allowing the user to
input meaningful information when entering their transactions and providing
a means for a future incarnation of KMyMoney2 to provide reporting and
budgeting features.
