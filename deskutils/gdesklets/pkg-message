In the future there will be a meta port of desklets to allow to choose
which desklets to install. It will probably be named
"gdesklets-desklets".

There are only few desklets in the ports tree at the moment. To help
porting more desklets please visit http://www.gdesklets.de/ and port
some desklets. Those ports should have a PKGNAMEPREFIX of "gdesklets-".
If the port only provides a sensor or a display the name should have a
sensor- or display- appended, so it would be e.g.
"gdesklets-sensor-<name>".
