At the moment, there are no gDesklets applets in the ports tree but I (and
others) will add them in future. Then, I will add the nice menu select in
here to allow you choose which applets want. So, for now please visit to
http://gdesklets.gnomedesktop.org/ and collect the applets. Install them by
yourself, the manual should be come in the tarballs.
