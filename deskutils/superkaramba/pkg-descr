SuperKaramba is, in simple terms, a tool that allows you to easily 
create interactive eye-candy on your KDE desktop.

Here are just some examples of the things that can be done: 

  o Display system information such as CPU Usage, MP3 playing, etc.
  o Create cool custom toolbars that work any way imaginable
  o Create little games or virtual pets that live on your desktop
  o Display information from the internet, such as weather and headlines
