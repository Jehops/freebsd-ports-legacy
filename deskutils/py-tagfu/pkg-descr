TagFu is a library for tagging entities (which can be anything with
a url) with Tags or metadata. TagFu is implemented in Python and very
closely mimics basic Python data structures. Tags is a Python list of
tags, Entities is a Python List of Entity objects, and Entity is a
dict which contains all the key-value pairs for all tags associated
to the Entity. The key is the Tag name and value is an arbitrary value,
if no value is set, the tag is considered to be a simple tag.
