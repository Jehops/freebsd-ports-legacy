Calcurse is a text-based personal organizer which helps keeping track
of events and everyday tasks. It contains a calendar, a 'todo' list,
and puts your appointments in order. The user interface is
configurable, and one can choose between different color schemes and
layouts.  All of the commands are documented within an online help
system.
