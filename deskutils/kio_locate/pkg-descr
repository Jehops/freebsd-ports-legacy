kio_locate is a KIO slave for konqueror which allows you:

* To search using locate you don't have to switch to a prompt.
* The search results are shown to you, as if you were in a directory.
  Any found file is just one click away.
* You could e.g. move all found files using Drag & Drop.
* And all that's possible from practically any KDE program, that can
  open files.
