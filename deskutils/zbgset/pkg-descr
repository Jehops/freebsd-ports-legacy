NAME
    zbgset - A perl program for managing the background.
       
SYNOPSIS
    zbgset (-f <file>|-r|-l) [-F <fill type>] [-s <ZConf set>]

USAGE
    Either -f, -r, or -l need used.
		     
    This does not actually set the background, but calls another program to
    do it, but what makes it useful is it allows for random images to be
    used as well as the last image to be called. This makes it useful for
    setting the image upon login or changing it regullarly through cron.

    When it is ran for the first time it creates a ZConf config named
    "zbgset" used store the settings.
