TaskStep is a list and to-do manager for local php servers. It requires a 
server (preferably local) and a decent browser (Firefox, not IE6).

It is designed to work vaguely with fans of GTD and act as a slightly more 
advanced task manager which can be kept on your computer, rather than over the
internet (although in theory you can put it up on the internet).

Here is a quick summary of the main features:
 * Sections for tasks organising them by immediate, this week, this month,
this year and lifetime tasks
 * Add and filter by contexts and projects (for Getting Things Done fans)
 * Print lists on 3 x 5 index cards
 * Automatically list all items for today
 * Highlighting of current and overdue items
 * Mark items as done on the spot, with a done button for each
 * Small. As in really really ridiculously small (~160KB download file)
 * It's free, but that's probably stating the obvious
