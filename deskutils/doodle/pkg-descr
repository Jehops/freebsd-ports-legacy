Doodle is a tool to quickly search the documents on a computer. Doodle
builds an index using meta-data contained in the documents and allows
fast searches on the resulting database. Doodle uses libextractor to
support obtaining meta-data from various file-formats. The database
used by doodle is a suffix tree, resulting in fast lookups. Doodle
supports approximate searches.
