NARVAL is the first software agent available as free software (Gnu Public
License).

Narval is the acronym of "Network Assistant Reasoning with a Validating
Agent Language".

Narval is a framework (language + interpreter + GUI/IDE) dedicated to the
setting up of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). An Intelligent Personal
Assitant is a companion that will help you in your daily work in the
information world. It runs on your machine or on a remote server, and you
can communicate with it via all standard means (email, web, telnet, phone,
specific GUI, etc). It executes recipes (sequences of actions) you wrote, to
perform a wide range of tasks, such as prepare your morning newspaper, help
you surf the web by filtering out junk ads, keep searching the web day after
day for things you want, participe in on-line auctions, learn you interests
and bring you back valuable information, take care of repetitive chores,
answer e-mail, negociate the date and time of a meeting, and much more... It
is easy to extend the built in action library by writing new actions in
Python.
