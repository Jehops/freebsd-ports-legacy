************************************************************************
Nag has been installed in %%NAGDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde and IMP must be configured; if not, see:
- %%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde2/pkg-message
- %%PORTSDIR%%/mail/imp3/pkg-message

Then, you have to create the table nag_tasks, from the SQL script
%%NAGDIR%%/scripts/drivers/nag_tasks.sql.
For example, if your database is MySQL, you may run
mysql --user=hordemgr --password=yourpass horde < nag_tasks.sql
(If you run another database server, see
 %%HORDEDIR%%/scripts/db/README
 for more explanations.)

Finally, you may have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the files conf.php.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
