Timer Applet is a countdown timer applet for the GNOME panel.

Highlights:
 * Quickly set a time and the applet will notify you when time's up
 * Create presets for quick access to frequently-used times
 * Small and unobtrusive. Choose to either view the remaining time right in
   the panel or hide it so you don't get distracted by the countdown.
   You can still view the remaining time by hovering your mouse over the
   timer icon
 * User interface follows the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines
