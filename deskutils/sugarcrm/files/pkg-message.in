Notes:

1.  SugarCRM requires that you increase the default PHP memory limit from
    8Mb to 10Mb in the php.ini file.  You should edit this file and ensure
    that the memory_limit parameter should be set to 10Mb or greater:

memory_limit = 10M	; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume 

2.  In order to get Apache or your preferred web server to recognise
    SugarCRM's location on your disk, you'll need to put the following line
    (or the equivalent) into the web server configuration:

Alias "/sugarcrm" "%%PREFIX%%/%%SUGARCRMDIR%%"

3.  If you're installing SugarCRM on your system for the first time, in
    order to complete installation, please point your browser to
    http://localhost/sugarcrm/ and set up your database and configuration
    parameters.  Once you have finished the installation procedure, you
    should remove the installation directory and make the SugarCRM
    configuration file (config.php) non writable.  You can do these things
    be executing the following commands:

chown root:wheel %%PREFIX%%/%%SUGARCRMDIR%%/config.php

4.  If you are upgrading SugarCRM from a previous version, please follow the
    instructions in %%DOCSDIR%%/UPGRADE-FreeBSD.txt.

5.  Please see the documentation directory (%%DOCSDIR%%)
    for full documentation on how to get the best out of SugarCRM.

6.  Enjoy!
