This is a preview version of kproject, a simple project planner.

At the moment this is not more than a Q&D hack, but it does some
basic functions, e. g.

- read a project list in the form 
	<Start node>:<End node>:<Duration>:<Text>
	
   where <Start node> and <End node> represents the dependencies of each
   process. You can edit this in the programm, but I think, it is
   much easier to edit a file with your favourite editor and load it.
   
   Two sample files are included in this package (see /samples).

- calculate buffer times. A "C" indicates, that this process is critical
  (total buffer time is zero)

- show the project as a GANTT diagram
