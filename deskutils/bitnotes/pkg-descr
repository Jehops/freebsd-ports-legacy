BitNotes are yet another desktop note taking applet, BUT, this one is connected
to the net. Huh, you say, what does that mean?, you ask. Well, everytime you
see a interesting URL or an important phone number for example, you usually
type it in some note pad application. The problem is, once you get to another
computer you can't get to your notes. With BitNotes, your notes are
automatically saved on a server. The notes you take at the office will also
pop up at home for example.

Enjoy!
