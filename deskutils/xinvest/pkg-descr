With Xinvest you can:

-Centralize record keeping by storing all transactions in account specific
 files.  
-Calculate total and annualized returns including the effects of buys, 
 sells, and dividends. This provides a means of comparing the results of all
 accounts in a portfolio, be they CDs, bonds, mutual funds, or your checking
 account.
-Receive automatic price updates in conjunction with the Xquote WWW quote
 retrieval program.
-View various transaction parameters such as share price, shares per 
 transaction, transaction cost, transaction value (at current price), 
 dividends, internal and total return, and/or cumulative and moving
 averages of the above. Plots are transaction based bar or date based x-y
 charts.
-View overall value weightings (asset allocation) of accounts in a
 portfolio. Specify categories, what percent of an account is in that category,
 and which accounts are of interest and Xinvest will tell you the value and
 percentage of all categories in the defined portfolio.  Predefined is a
 account category to view weighting of accounts in the total portfolio.
 Categories are hierarchical, so you can zoom into the makeup of your portfolio.
-View in text and pie chart form.

A Financial calculator with common equations is provided.  Included are
FV, PV, FV of sum of payments, and periodic loan payments.
Hopefully, all of this is displayed using an easy-to-use, point-and-click 
interface.  There are few command line switches, no dot files, and X
resources are limited to color and font selection allowing you to tailor
the look of the tool to your own preferences.
