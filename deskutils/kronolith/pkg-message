Kronolith has been installed in %%KRONOLITHDIR%% with your
blank configuration files.

Horde and IMP must be configured; if not, see:
- %%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde2/pkg-message
- %%PORTSDIR%%/mail/imp3/pkg-message

libmcal must be configured with the driver mstore for the user www:

- mkdir /var/calendar
- chmod 1777 /var/calendar
- htpasswd -c %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/mpasswd www

(this port has tried to make it for you, perhaps you'll just have to
check - see %%PORTSDIR%%/misc/libmcal/pkg-message)

Then, you may have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the files conf.php.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.
