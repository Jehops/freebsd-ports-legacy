Before you can use portsnap, you will have to create an update configuration
file specifying the server from which to fetch snapshots and the sha256 hash
of the openssl public key which is trusted to sign the snapshots.

A sample configuration file has been installed in

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/portsnap.conf.sample

which will fetch snapshots built and signed by the author.  If you want to
use these updates, copy that file to

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/portsnap.conf

otherwise, create that file as appropriate.

NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM PORTSNAP 0.3.1 OR EARLIER:  The structure
of the portsnap configuration file has changed; you will have to replace
your existing portsnap.conf with a new version.
