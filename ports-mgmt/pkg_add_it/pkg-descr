This program provides an interactive interface for the pkg_add(1) tool.

It's purpose is to search for a package pattern, making easier for the user
to find a package and install it. This tool is not a clone of pkg_add(1).
It uses pkg_add(1) to install packages while providing an interactive 
interface, so the user could easily choose and install a given package.

This tool is written in C and does not require any additional packages to be
installed. It should build and run on any system which supports pkg_add(1).

The pkg_add_it(1) tool supports local and remote pattern search:

   * Local pattern search - recursively scanning a directory for 
     a given package pattern
   * Remote pattern search - accomplished by searching the INDEX file.
     If INDEX is not in current directory pkg_add_it(1) fetches it and
     then scans the INDEX file for a pattern
     
To learn more about the pkg_add_it(1) tool read the manual page.
