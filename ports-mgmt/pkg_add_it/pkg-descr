This program provides an interactive interface for the pkg_add(1) tool.

It's purpose is to search for a package pattern, making easier for the user
to find a package and install it. This is not a clone of the pkg_add(1) tool.
It uses pkg_add(1) to install packages while providing an interactive 
interface, so the user could easily choose and install a given package.

The pkg_add_it(1) tool supports local and remote pattern search:

   * Local pattern search - recursively scanning a directory for 
     a given package pattern
   * Remote pattern search - accomplished by scannig the INDEX file
     for every package that matches the pattern

To learn more about the pkg_add_it(1) tool read the manual page.
