This is a package to test FreeBSD port auditing systems, e.g. portaudit 
and the upcoming VuXML based system. Even though it installs no files, 
it is registered in the local package database.

Its version number is automagically the installation date, so that you 
can update it every day ;-) If the date is off by one day keep in mind 
that the date is in UTC which may differ from your local time up to 
twelve hours, depending on the time zone you live in.

The portaudit database lists yesterday's vulnerability test port as 
vulnerable so that it should appear in your security report approximately 
after a week, depending on the synchronization schedule of your database.

If you try install the port with
  make INSTALLATION_DATE=`date -u -v-14d "+%Y.%m.%d"` install
the port is instantly flagged as vulnerable and the ports system should 
hinder you installing it (currently not implemented), otherwise your 
vulnerability database is too old.
