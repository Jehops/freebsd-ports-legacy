This is port ports-mgmt/portmk, an alternate bsd.port.mk.

Targets of this project are:

- Modularization of bsd.port.mk, to make refactoring possible.

- Better awareness of upcoming features for ports developers,
  including giving them the ability to review changes and give
  feedback early.

- Faster turnaround times for development patches.

- Widespread testing of new features.

- Faster adoption of advanced features without endangering the
  stability of the ports tree.
