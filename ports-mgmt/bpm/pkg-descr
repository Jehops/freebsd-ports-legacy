BSD Ports Manipulator (BPM) is a graphical ports collection manager for
FreeBSD.  It has a GTK+ 2.0 interface and allows you to add, remove, or
upgrade software packages on your system without requiring you to use a
command-line. In addition, it can display details about available,
installed, and out-of-date ports, as well as allowing you to search
based on port descriptions.

BPM uses the existing ports collection structure, allowing it to build
ports from source and integrate seamlessly with other tools.

This project started out as a clone of Ports Manager.app for
DarwinPorts.
