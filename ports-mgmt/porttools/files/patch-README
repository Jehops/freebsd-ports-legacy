 FreeBSD Port Tools consist of the several small scripts run from
 port(1) front-end:
-- port commit: commit a port into the FreeBSD Ports CVS Repository
+- port commit: commit a port into the FreeBSD Ports SVN Repository
 - port create: create a new port from a template
 - port diff: generate a diff against a previous version of the port
 - port fetch: fetch distfile(s) of a new version of the port

 Let us assume you are interested in helping out with one of the ports.
 The most convenient way of doing that with the Port Tools is the following.
 Even though the Port Tools have 3 most of diff generation, the recommended is 
-CVS (default). Do not be scared away at this point - it is very simple.
+SVN (default). Do not be scared away at this point - it is very simple.
 Let me give a quick overview:
 
-1. Set up CVSROOT environment variable
-
-   sgk@elf% export CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.FreeBSD.org:/home/ncvs"

-   NOTE: you may want to check the Handbook for a list of anonymous CVS servers

    (NOTE: my ~/ports directory contains only those ports I am interested in,
    i.e. either maitain or send changes/updates to. Thus, it does not have
    to contain the whole FreeBSD Ports tree)
 
    sgk@elf:~% cd ~/ports
-   sgk@elf:~/ports% cvs co ipsvd
+   sgk@elf:~/ports% svn co ipsvd
 
    ipsvd is the sample port name.
