KPorts is Qt-based frontend to the FreeBSD-Ports.
Support for the OpenBSD-Ports and PkgSrc is planned for a future release.

It is designed to make managing your applications easier and more pleasent.

This is the Port based on the new Qt4-only codebase. You cannot(!) use this to
actually install and remove packages. If you need to do that use the version
based on KDE3: ports-mgmt/kports.
