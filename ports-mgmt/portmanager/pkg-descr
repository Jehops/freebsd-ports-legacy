FreeBSD port collection management.  Insures your ports are only built with
the most up to date sources. Great for users of KDE or GNOME who are always
concerned over the way their underlying ports are built. **New option** 
leaf port report: Shows ports with no other ports depending on them, these are
ports that may be safely deinstalled.
