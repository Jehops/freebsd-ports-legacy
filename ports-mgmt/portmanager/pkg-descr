FreeBSD port collection management.  Update your ports easily. Great
for users of KDE or GNOME who need to be concerned about how
dependency ports are built.  

**New options**

1)  Leaf port report: Shows ports with no other ports depending on
them, these are ports that may be safely de-installed.

2)  Remove leaf ports safely: Interactively delete leaf ports.
