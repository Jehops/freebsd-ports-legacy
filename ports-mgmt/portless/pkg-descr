portless is a small shell script which lets FreeBSD users quickly browse
port descriptions given the port's name or a glob. Basically to view
the descriptions of GCC (related) ports you type
	portless gcc\*
and portless will display the descriptions of all gcc* ports.
There are options to display the postinstall messages or Makefiles instead.
