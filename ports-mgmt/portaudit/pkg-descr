portaudit provides a system to check if installed ports are listed in a 
database of published security vulnerabilities.

After installation it will update this security database automatically and 
include its reports in the output of the daily security run.

If you have found a vulnerability not listed in the database, please contact 
the FreeBSD Security Officer <security-officer@FreeBSD.org>. Refer to

  http://www.freebsd.org/security/#sec

for more information.
