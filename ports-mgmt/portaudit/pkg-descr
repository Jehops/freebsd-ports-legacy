portaudit provides a list of published security vulnerabilities
of FreeBSD ports and tools to check if installed ports are listed.

After installation it will update the security database automatically
and include its reports in the output of the daily security run.

Since this is a prerelease version, it is mostly usable for
committers that want to contribute to the project, and can currently
not be relied upon as an extensive security auditing tool.

Credits go to Roland Dowdeswell <elric@NetBSD.org> and Bill
Sommerfeld <sommerfeld@NetBSD.org> for the idea and Alistair
Crooks <agc@NetBSD.org>  for the initial implementation.
