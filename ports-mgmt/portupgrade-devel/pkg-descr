Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via ports or
packages.  It upgrades installed packages without reinstalling
depending or dependent packages by directly updating the package
registry database located under /var/db/pkg.  It can also trace
dependency chains up and down and upgrade packages recursively.

This package also includes the following utilities:
portinstall:	This helps you install new ports in a handy way.
		Equivalent to `portupgrade -N'.
portversion:	This is a replacement of pkg_version(8), which runs
		faster than pkg_version and is cooperative with
		portupgrade.
portsdb:	This is a tool to create, update or look up ports
		database, which is made from the ports index file.
pkg_deinstall:	This is a package deinstaller with wildcards and
		dependency recursion support.
pkg_glob:	This is a package glob expander with wildcards and
		dependency recursion support.
pkgdepfix:	This is an interactive tool to fix /var/db/pkg's
		@pkgdep vs. +REQUIRED_BY discrepancies, and stale or
		missing origins, optionally.
