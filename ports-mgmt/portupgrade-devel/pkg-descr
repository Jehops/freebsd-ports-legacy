Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via the port.

It upgrades ports without reinstalling dependent packages by directly
modifying the package info recorded in the files under /var/db/pkg.

You may want to use portversion which is a replacement of
pkg_version(8) optimized and cooperative with portupgrade.
