Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via ports or
packages.  Also, it allows you to install new ports/packages in a
handy way.

It upgrades installed packages without reinstalling depending or
dependent packages by directly updating the package registry database
located under /var/db/pkg.  Moreover, it can trace dependency chains
up and down and upgrade packages recursively.

This package also includes the following utilities:
portinstall:	This is an equivalent to `portupgrade -N', which means
		it by default tries to install a new one when a
		specified package is not installed.
portversion:	This is a replacement of pkg_version(8), which runs
		faster than pkg_version and is cooperative with
		portupgrade.
portsdb:	This is a tool to create, update or look up ports
		database, which is made from the ports index file.
pkgdepfix:	This is an interactive tool to fix /var/db/pkg's
		@pkgdep vs. +REQUIRED_BY discrepancies, and stale or
		missing origins, optionally.
