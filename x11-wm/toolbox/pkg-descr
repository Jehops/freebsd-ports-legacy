Please use x11-wm/bbconf, which is the successor of this older version.

(excerpt from bbconf home page, http://bbconf.sourceforge.net/)
bbconf has grown from two previous gui configuration tools, namely bbkeysconf (the gui
blackbox keygrabber configurator) and toolbox (the gui blackbox style/theme editor). But
thanks to xOr's help (YAY xOr!! Woot! =:), bbconf has become far more than the combination of
those prior two tools. It has taken the place of them (read: no more development will be done
on bbkeysconf or toolbox), and has the capability to do FAR much more.
