This is a stable version of AfterStep.  AfterStep is a NeXTStep
style window manager and features quick easy configuration of the look and
feel of your setup without the use of a .steprc file.  Configuration in 
most cases is far easier than it used to be.  There are a few small bugs, 
but this release is fairly stable.  Included are a number of AfterStep 
applications including asclock, ascd, and xiterm.  There are a number of
other very Linux specific applications which are not at present included.
