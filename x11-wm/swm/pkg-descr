from the Web page:

	SWM was written for small computer systems with very little
	memory and small screen sizes. It was written to speed up
	working with laptops or even PDAs. You need a minimum of
	about 20 kB of diskspace.  It uses even less memory than
	rxvt.

The swmswitch command crashes, so it is not installed.
