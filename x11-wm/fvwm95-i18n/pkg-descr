Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2.x. It tries to emulate the good
features of a well known product without bloating the regular 
fvwm code. The main aspects are: 

A familiar look and feel. It can be interesting for users moving
from the MS-World to Unix, or for those who have to switch 
regularly between the two.

Or for those that simply would like to have the same MS look and feel 
in Unix, or for those that just want to have another window manager...

But before all, it's meant to be useful, simple and efficient:
	o same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm
	o functionality extensible via loadable modules;
	o a taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't 
	  take space with icon windows;
