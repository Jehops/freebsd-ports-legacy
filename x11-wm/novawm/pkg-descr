NovaWM is a new window manager for the X Windows System (X11).  It is
developed with speed, size, and style in mind.  NovaWM takes on its own
style that is different than ANY window manager.  NovaWM isn't too large
and toyish like many popular window managers like the desktops (KDE and
GNOME).  Also like some window managers NovaWM has its own toolkit that
is much easier to understand and develop with than most others though
NovaWM itself doesn't use the toolkit to create its interface, reducing
the dependency on other libraries.  NovaWM was also developed with the
idea of integration and digital media in mind and so future versions of
NovaWM are planned to support easy application integration and have
support for integration of digital media applications.
