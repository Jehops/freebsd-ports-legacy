It is a neat little utility if you like to run multiple window managers
easily. It starts up in place of your window manager, and lets you chose
one. Once a WM is launched, it hides itself until that WM terminates,
then it shows itself again and lets you choose another WM, and so on,
until you press the Close button.

Just write "xwmm" instead of your favorite window manager in ~/.xinitrc or
~/.xsession.

If you have K-Desktop Envirenment, it is recommended to use "startkde.xwmm"
script rather than "startkde" to start KDE in the xwmm setting.
