It is a neat little utility if you like to run multiple window managers
easily. It starts up in place of your window manager, and lets you chose
one. Once a WM is launched, it hides itself until that WM terminates,
then it shows itself again and lets you choose another WM, and so on,
until you press the Close button.

If you have K-Desktop Envirenment, it is recommended to use "startkde.fixed"
script rather than "startkde" to start KDE.
