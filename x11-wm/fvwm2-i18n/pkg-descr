Fvwm is a very famous window manager for X, which provides a
virtual/multiple disjoint desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations,
shaped/color icons.  It gives a very good emulation of mwm.  A nice
button-bar can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

This package also enables multibyte support to add internationalized
features; use multibyte characters in titlebar, icon name, etc.
