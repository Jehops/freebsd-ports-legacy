Fvwm is a very famous window manager for X, which provides a
virtual/multiple disjoint desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations,
shaped/color icons.  It gives a very good emulation of mwm.  A nice
button-bar can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

This packages also employs I18N_MB patch, to add internationalized features;
use multibyte characters in titlebar, icon name, etc.
