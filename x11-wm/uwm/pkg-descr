This is a small, simple window manager, contributed to X11R3 by DEC.

The behavior of uwm can be customized by configuration files.

Since uwm does not decorate windows, it may not be obvious that it has started.
By default, middle-clicking on the root window with the middle mouse button
will bring up a menu of window operations.  Pressing a mouse button while
holding an Alt key will raise or lower the window under the pointer, or (when
done on the root window) circulate windows up or down.
