This is the MS Windows like taskbar module for Enlightenment.

It will hold all of your open applications for fast switching.

There are three basic functionalities that you don't want to miss:
1. If you click on an icon it will be shown and raised to the top
   and if its on another desk, then you will be switched to it. 
2. If you drag an icon out of ITask the App will be shown on the
   current desktop.
3. Drag an icon to a pagers desk to send it.
