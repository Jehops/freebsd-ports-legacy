The matchbox window manager is suitable for use on low-resolution
screens, such as those on mobile computers.  It sizes most windows
so they take up the whole screen.  All decorations are contained
in the title bar.

Besides the window manager itself, this port installs the dock and
applets (clock, battery meter, load meter, mixer, launcher, and
theme changer--the mbmenu and mbwave applets are omitted because
they are Linux-specific).

The dock may be used with the metacity window manager.  Matchbox
is compatible with the GNOME and KDE panels.
