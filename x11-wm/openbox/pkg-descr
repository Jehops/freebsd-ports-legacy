Openbox is a window manager for the X11 windowing system. It currently runs
on a large list of platforms. It was originally based on Blackbox and currently
remains very similar, even using Blackbox styles (with available extensions)
for its themeing.

-Why does Openbox exist?
Openbox is the spawn of a number of previous Blackbox users/hackers. Being
overall pleased with the window manager, but feeling left unable to contribute,
this project was born. It aims to be open for all to contribute to.
