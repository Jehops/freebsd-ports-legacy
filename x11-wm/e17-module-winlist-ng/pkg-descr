A Winlist NG module for Enlightenment 17.
It is a replacement for the standard winlist.

This module should not only look different as the e17 winlist, it
also will get a lot of functionality i was missing, for example:
decide while selecting if you want to jump to the desk of the
selected app or bring the selected app to the current desk, close
the selected app directly, show the selected app on the current
desk(if it's on another desk), etc.
