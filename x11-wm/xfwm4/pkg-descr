This is a port of xfwm4, a gtk-2.0 based window manager part of the
XFCE project. It is ideal for use with GNOME, KDE or XFCE as it does
not have a taskbar, icon support, or program launcher.

Features include the following:

 - Based on gtk-2.0
 - Themeable appearance (several themes included)
 - Virtual desktops
 - Full keyboard control
 - Pango font rendering, and antialiased text support using GDK_USE_XFT
 - Implements both GNOME and NET standards
 - And it's stable
