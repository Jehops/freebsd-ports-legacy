The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficient desktop
working environment available.  To achieve this waimea is a fast and
highly customizable virtual desktop window manager.  It uses blackbox
image rendering engine (blackbox styles support) and can use Xft library
for font rendering (anti-aliased font support).  It also features a very
advanced configuration system with which it's possible to make waimea
behave as almost any other window manager.

Features already included are:

    * Virtual desktop
    * Blackbox image rendering engine (blackbox style support)
    * Action Configuration System
    * Advanced Menu System
    * Standard X core fonts
    * Xft fonts (anti-aliased fonts)
    * Dockapp handler system
    * Task switcher
