This is a minimalist window manager which implements the ICCCM.
It provides titlebars, and allows raising, lowering, resizing, and
hiding (but not un-hiding) windows.  Placement of new windows
depends on the position of the pointer.  It is partly based on 9wm.

This port installs not only the window manager, but also the aemenu
and aepanel applets.  These provide a list of windows by title
(vertically for aemenu, horizontally for aepanel) and a menu from
which programs may be run.
