Sapphire is a small window manager based on aewm and blackbox.
Windows can be rolled up or hidden.  Programs can be run from a
menu.  A clock and calendar are built in.

This version of sapphire incorporates a patch which cycles windows
up or down when Alt+up cursor or Alt+down cursor are pressed.

If you like this window manager, you may wish to install the
sapphire-themes package to accompany it.
