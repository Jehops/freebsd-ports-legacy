tpager or Tiny Pager is a very lightweight aplication designed to be fast
and small. It shows your workspaces and allows you to change between them.

There are numerous arguments that you can use to change the pager's layout.

The program is developed using C and Xlib so there is no big dependencies
needed.

This pager is in compliance with EWMH, so it is supported on Gnome, Kde,
Xfce4, Rox, Openbox and every other window manager or desktop system that
support these standarts.
