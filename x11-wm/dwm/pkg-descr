dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating
modes, much like ion, larswm and wmii. dwm however is much smaller, faster and
simpler.

It consists of a single binary and configuration is done by editing the source
code, which makes it fast and secure. dwm reads from standard input to print
arbitrary status text such as the date and/or system load.
