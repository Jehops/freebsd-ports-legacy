WindowMaker s a new Windowmanager for X written by Alfredo Kojima. It follows
in the tradition of Afterstep, attempting to emulate the most fantastic of
UI's posessed by the NeXT STEP(tm) operating system. It has many qualities
that make it superior to AfterStep, although it is still in development, and
does lack features. When it is completed, it will be a GNUSTEP compliant
Windowmanager that requires no editing of messy configuration files.
