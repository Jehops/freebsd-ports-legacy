High Performance Liquid KDE style engine

Features include:
* Translucent Menus.
* High performance. No scaling is required, and caching (thus memory usage) is
  kept to a minimum. Custom tile drawing code is used for maximum speed. I
  wanted to create a style engine that both looked cool and is usable on an
  everyday basis by people doing stuff like compiling all day. I've even
  gotten emails from a couple users using it over remote X terminals and they
  report good speed results! :)
* Colors are fully configurable. This is really cool with this style. It also
  handles custom colors like KCalc's correctly. Check out the screenshots
  below.
* Mouse Hover is supported for Pushbuttons, ComboBoxes, RadioButtons,
  CheckBoxes, and ScrollBars. This doesn't use the crappy "draw a box around
  the widget" mouse hover, either, but makes the widget appear to light up.
* Automagically themes the KDE panel, according to the color scheme.
