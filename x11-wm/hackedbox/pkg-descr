Hackedbox is based upon the popular Blackbox window manager.  It
aims to be fast and free of bloat.  Several Blackbox features,
including the toolbar and Slit, have been removed in Hackedbox.  No
new features are planned, only optimizations and fixes.

In this port/package, blackbox, bsetbg and bsetroot are renamed to
hackedbox, hsetbg and hsetroot in order to avoid conflict with the
corresponding programs from the blackbox port/package.
