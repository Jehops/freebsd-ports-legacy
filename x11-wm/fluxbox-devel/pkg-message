*******************************************************************************
This is a development release and should not be considered stable. If you want
stable use version 0.1.14, please use x11-wm/fluxbox instead.

This is one version of many to come before a stable 1.0.0 release. Check out the
RoadMap on http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/roadmap.php for more information about
upcoming versions.

ATTENTION: Now, the -devel has been removed and the CONFLICTS to x11-wm/fluxbox
	   has been added. The x11-wm/fluxbox-devel is stable enough to use
	   daily and we doubt someone will install both fluxbox and
	   fluxbox-devel.

	   Since the '-devel' suffix has been removed, you should either use
	   fluxbox-generate_menu to regenerate the menu or edit your
	   ~/.fluxbox/menu to remove the -devel suffix.

	   As of 0.9.6 the shell script 'startfluxbox' has been added. It should
	   be executed instead of fluxbox itself from ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession.
