*******************************************************************************
This is a development release and should not be considered stable.
If you want stable use version 0.1.14.
This is one version of many to come before a stable 1.0.0 release.
Check out the RoadMap on http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/roadmap.php
for more information about upcoming versions.

ATTENTION: As of 0.9.6 the shell script 'startfluxbox-devel' has been added.
           It should be executed instead of fluxbox itself from
           ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession.
