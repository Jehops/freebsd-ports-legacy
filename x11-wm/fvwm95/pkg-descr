This is fvwm-2.0.41 (with the pixmap cache patch) hacked for a look and
feel similar to Windows-95. 

It's also included a hacked version of the Win95WinList module from
David Barth (original from Mike Finger), whichs looks very close
to the Windows-95 task bar. There is a clock and incoming mail
indicator on it, it can also swallow other modules. The module is
named FvwmTaskBar, for more information read the README file in
the modules/FvwmTaskBar directory.
