This module aims to provide quick access to some applications given
its name/class pair.

It is based on the widely known "yakuake" (http://yakuake.uv.ro/),
that drops konsole (kde's terminal emulator) instances from top just
like Quake did.

Unlike yakuake, this module should be extensible and fit any
application, like urxvt to provide same functionality, but could also
fit emacs/gvim, firefox or similar.
