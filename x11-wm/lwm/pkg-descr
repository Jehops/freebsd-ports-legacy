From lwm webpage,

lwm is a window manager for X that tries to keep out of your
face. There are no icons, no button bars, no icon docks, no root
menus, no nothing...

--

It's a tiny (less than 30k shared binary) and fast window manager.  The
web page is also one-page user manual.  See 9menu(1) for root menu.
