addport	- future replacement for easy-import

consistency-check -  check whether all your ports are installed properly,
                     what files have changed, and what new files there are
checknewvers - checks for availability for a newest version of distfiles on
               MASTER_SITES (ftp only).
close-pr  - a slightly hacked version of edit-pr(1) to quickly close PR.
distclean - compare md5 sums of distfiles in ports/distfiles with currently
            installed ports collection in ports/* and prompt to remove
            unmatched entries
getpr   - downloads a problem report from GNATS and attempts to extract
          the patch, shar, uuencoded file from it.
          this probably needs to be checked for potential security problems.
prpatch - just does `patch $1 < pr-patch' (pr-patch is created by getpr)
prdone  - checks in the port, attempting to fill out the commit message using
          information from the problem report and then takes you into edit-pr
          so you don't forget to close the PR.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

consistency-check gives output like:

Not on filesystem - jade from jade-1.2.1
Only on filesystem - jadefoo
No package md5 available for lessecho
File nsgmls owned by multiple packages sp-1.3.4,jade-1.2.1
No filesystem md5 available for setuser, but it exists                          
For sgmlnorm, package md5 312d7b63d591e07629e0da4ae4a0ac07 is DIFFERENT from fs md5 of 19f1f901911b90d8e04c6ea69e1b0541!

change $do_md5 to 0 to not check md5, and $do_fs to 0 to not check for
files above those installed by packages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

getpr, prpatch and prdone are used as so:
	% cd /usr/ports/CATEGORY/PORT
	% getpr PRNUMBER
	<read diff presented to you>
	<check that there are no followups to the PR as getpr wont' split
	 them out of the PR>
	% prpatch
	<test port>
	% prdone PRNUMBER ci
	<this will attempt to fill out the cvs log message, check in the
	 port and edit-pr the problem report so you can close it>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

checksum is a script that allows checking of ports to see if their checksums
match, and if they don't, give a diff against the older version to try and
discover why the checksum didn't match.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

distclean is a script that allows to compare md5 checksums of distfiles in
ports/distfiles with list of all md5 sums listed in "md5" files in the ports
collection. After comparing, utility will prompt to remove distfiles which
doesn't have associated md5 entry (most likely outdated distfiles).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: These scripts need work and are *NOT* safe to use unless you know
      what they do.  Use at your own risk.  Patches would be great, but
      I'd prefer they pass through me.
