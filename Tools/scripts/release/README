$FreeBSD$

This directory contains the scripts that are used to break up the packages
for a given release, so that they fit on a particular 4 CD set.  They rely
on src/release/scripts/print-cdrom-packages.sh to give preference for
particular packages to be located on particular CDs.

The approximate procedure is:

1) CVSROOT/avail lockout
2) cvs rtag RELEASE_4_5_0 ports

1) cd /a/steve/4.5/i386/RC3
2) ./scripts/setup.sh (may want to redirect stdout to a file,
   as this gives copious output.)
3) ./doit.sh

More documentation to come later.
