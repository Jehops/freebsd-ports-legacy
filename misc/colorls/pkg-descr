This is a simple hack to the FreeBSD /bin/ls to use ANSI sequences to
display file attributes in color.  There is a -G flag (somewhat
similar to the -F flag).  Take a look at the man page for details.

The program is called "colorls" and installs itself in /usr/local/bin.
The file patches/patch-aa is the diffs from the 3.0-current (as of
1997/01/01) /usr/src/bin/ls directory.

Standard xterm prior to XFree86 3.1.2B doesn't know about colors, so
you should use update your XFree86 or use kterm (available from the ports
collection).
