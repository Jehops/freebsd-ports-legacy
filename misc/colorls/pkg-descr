This is a simple hack to the FreeBSD /bin/ls to use ANSI sequences to
display file attributes in color.  There is a -G flag (somewhat
similar to the -F flag).  Take a look at the man page for details.

The program is called "colorls" and installs itself in /usr/local/bin.
The file patches/patch-aa is the diffs from the 3.0-stable (as of
2000/06/01) /usr/src/bin/ls directory.

Also, note that you need a "color-capable" terminal to enable colorls --
this means you should set your TERM to "xterm-color" or "kterm-color"
when using normal xterm or kterm, not "xterm" or "kterm" (which
termcap doesn't know that are color-capable).
