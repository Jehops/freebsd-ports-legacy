This tool takes your server.met file and checks which servers are
dead and which are alive. It then creates a new server.met file
which contains only working servers.  It makes sense to use this
tool every time before you start the eDonkey 2000 client.

On request this tool also creates a web page with ed2k:// links to
all working servers.
