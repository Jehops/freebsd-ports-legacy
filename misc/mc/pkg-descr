This is version 3.0 of the Midnight Commander, a free Norton Commander
Clone with many useful features. The Midnight Commander comes with
mouse support on xterms.

The Midnight Commander is a directory browsing tool which bears a
certain remote resemblance to John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS.
The Midnight Commander doesn't have all the bells and whistles of its
DOS counterpart, but was written in much less time.
