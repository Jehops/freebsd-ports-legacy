Porteasy lets you install ports and build packages without maintaining
a full ports tree.  It achieves this by scanning the ports index for
dependency information, and using CVS to update only the ports you
requested and their dependencies.

Here are some of the things porteasy does for you:

  - automatically update the necessary files (and only the necessary
    files) using CVS (including anoncvs support)

  - list all of a port's dependencies, optionally hiding those that
    are already installed

  - fetch all the necessary distfiles right away, in a single batch,
    so you don't have to wait for one dependency to build before
    fetching the next one's distfile.  Dialup users will love this.

  - build and install arbitrary ports.

  - build packages.
