Earthview produces a view or an image file output of an arbitrary region of
the Earth, showing the elevation of lands and depth of oceans across the
globe. It also supports other data sets such as the population density. The
package only includes low-resolution samples, but earthview can make use of
the GTOPO30 or ETOPO2 data sets, which have a resolution better than 1km on
most land areas, and better than 4km in the oceans.
