The utility allows you to download firmware into and upload firmware from the
memory of a Cypress EZ-USB chip (AN2131 & friends).

The chip is a generic 8051 based programmeble device. To function in a specific
device, e.g. a USB to Parallel port convertor, the 8051 needs application
specific 8051 firmware code.

The input file or the produced output file is in Intel Hex format.
