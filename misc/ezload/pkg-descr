memory of a EZ-USB chip.

The chip is a generic 8051 based programmeble device. To function in a specific
device, e.g. a USB to Parallel port convertor, the 8051 needs application

An example program for the ActiveWire board is included, including the
Hex file with firmware for it. The board is available from
