                *** IMPORTANT! ***

An autogenerated DES key has been installed for you in
${PREFIX}/etc/afbackup/cryptkey. Remember to change it!

Also, ${PREFIX}/share/doc/afbackup contains the documentation
you ought to read before starting using the package.

For server configuration one must add two services into
/etc/services files:

afbackup	2988/tcp
afmbackup	2989/tcp

and into /etc/inetd.conf:

afbackup stream tcp nowait afbackup ${PKG_PREFIX}/libexec/afbackup/afserver ${PKG_PREFIX}/libexec/afbackup/afserver ${PKG_PREFIX}/etc/afbackup/server.conf
afmbackup stream tcp nowait afbackup ${PKG_PREFIX}/libexec/afbackup/afmserver ${PKG_PREFIX}/libexec/afbackup/afmserver ${PKG_PREFIX}/etc/afbackup/server.conf

For more information on how to configure the package read
${PKG_PREFIX}/share/doc/afbackup/INSTALL keeping in mind that
the package conforms to hier(7); in other words, paths are
different from what is mentioned in the document.
