Quranref offers simple tools for word and passage-based access to M. H.
Shakir's translation of the Holy Qur'an. With Quranref, you can perform
most of the more basic, low-level functions commercial browsing packages
offer (and perhaps a few not found in some of the commercial Qur'an study
packages).  You can, for example,

        -  retrieve any passage by section:verse number
        -  move forward or backward relative to the retrieved passage
        -  search the entire Qur'an for words and/or word-patterns
        -  search for word co-occurrences (or the absence thereof)
        -  save passages and/or passage-lists for use with an editor

Although this program is hardly the product of any major research effort,
it should prove sophisticated enough for casual use.  Its main fault right
now is that it relies on a scanned text which is positively rife with
errors.
