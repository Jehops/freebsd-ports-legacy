# If a port installs Qt version-specific binaries (e.g. "designer" which
# existed as a Qt4 application and exists as a Qt5 application and will
# probably be a Qt6 application) which should have a qtchooser-based
# wrapper, the port should set `QT_BINARIES=yes`.
#
# When QT_BINARIES is set to yes, compatibility symlinks (in bin/,
# designer -> qtchooser, so that qtchooser can run designer-qt5 or
# whatever is the selected Qt version) are installed by the port.
#
# Versioned binaries in ports are conventionally installed in <ver>/bin/,
# so qt5/bin/designer is the versioned form of "designer".
