misc/tinderbox is now setup, but it requires some additional setup.

The following walkthrough is for PostgreSQL databases:

- First, run the setup program:
    %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts/setup.sh

  If the database is running on the same server as you're on now,
  and you have administrator access to it, answer this question
  with yes:
	"Does this host have access to connect to the Tinderbox database as a database administrator?"

  Enter database admin user [root]: pgsql
  Enter the desired username for the Tinderbox database : tinderbox
  Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
  Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
  Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

  The other questions should just be entered through.

The following walkthrough is the tinderbox environment setup:

- Edit the file %%PREFIX%%/scripts/tinderbox.ph
  
  - $BUILD_ROOT should be "%%PREFIX%%/tinderbox"
  - $SUBJECT should be "My Tinderbox"
  - $SENDER should be your email address
  - $SMTP_HOST should be your SMTP server (localhost?)
  - $SERVER_HOST should be the name your machine is known as. If
    it is your own machine and your access it directory, try localhost
    here if nothing else sounds reasonable.
  - Comment out the lines after "for www", and uncomment the lines 

- Edit the file %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts/www-exp/inc_ds.php

  - $DB_HOST should be localhost
  - $DB_DRIVER should be pgsql
  - $DB_USER should be tinderbox

- Edit the file %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts/www-exp/inc_tinderbox.php

  - $rootdir should be %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox
  - $wwwrooturi should be /tb
  - $tinderbox_name should be "My Tinderbox"
  - $tinderbox_title should be "FreeBSD Packages"

The following walkthrough is the initial tinderbox population setup
and should be executed in %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts.


- Create a jail. A jail is a chrooted version of the FreeBSD operating
  system, for example 6.0-RELEASE or 5.4-RELEASE:
  ./create Jail -j 5.4 -d "FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE" -t RELENG_5_4_0_RELEASE -u CVSUP
  You can have multiple jails on a single machine.
  This takes a while.

- Create a ports tree:
  ./create PortsTree -p FreeBSD -d "FreeBSD ports tree" -w http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/
  This takes a while.

- And then link the two together in a build:
  ./create Build -b 5.4-FreeBSD -j 5.4 -p FreeBSD -d "5.4-RELEASE with FreeBSD ports tree"

- Now the tinderbox is ready to be used. See the documents
  %%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts/README and the "Using Tinderbox"
  section for more information.

The following walkthrough is the webserver setup:

- In your Apache configuration, add the following lines:

  Alias /tb/ "/usr/local/tinderbox/scripts/www-exp"
  <Directory "/usr/local/tinderbox/scripts/www-exp/">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Directory>

  Check your system by going to http://localhost/tb/

- And now, the first port build!

Now the tinderbox is ready to be used. See the documents
%%PREFIX%%/tinderbox/scripts/README and the "Using Tinderbox" section
for more information.
