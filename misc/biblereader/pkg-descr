BibleReader is a Bible study program for Linux/X, as well as any POSIX
system which supports gtk+. It uses the popular Gtk+ widget set.
Currently, BibleReader has the capacity to find a passage by reference,
search for a phrase using an intuitive combination of boolean searching
and regular expressions, and has a filter which enables searches to be
limited to a selection of books.
