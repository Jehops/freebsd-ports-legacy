BibleReader is a Bible browsing/searching program for Linux/X. It uses
the popular Gtk+ widget set. Currently, BibleReader has the capacity to
find a passage by reference, search for a phrase using regular
expressions, and has a filter which enables searches to be limited to a
selection of books. BibleReader comes with the King James Version
(otherwise known as the Authorised Version) of the Bible. The BibleReader
program is distributed under the GNU General Public License. The actual
Bible text that is currently packaged with BibleReader (i.e. the KJV text
of the Bible) is not copyrighted, as it's copyright has expired.
