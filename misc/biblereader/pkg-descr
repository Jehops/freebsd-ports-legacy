BibleReader is a Bible study program for Linux/X, as well as any POSIX
system which supports gtk+. It uses the popular Gtk+ widget set.
Currently, BibleReader has the capacity to find a passage by reference,
search for a phrase using an intuitive combination of boolean searching
and regular expressions, and has a filter which enables searches to be
limited to a selection of books. 

The latest version of BibleReader is a great improvement over previous
versions. It includes a  range of new features, including support for
notes/commentaries, such as the Matthew Henry Commentary which has been
made available in BibleReader format. Also, Bible dictionaries are now
supported, and Easton's Bible dictionary has been placed in BibleReader
format.
