Stickynotes_applet is a Gnome 2 applet that allows you to create, view, and 
maintain sticky notes on your Gnome 2 Desktop. Each note is "sticky" 
(appears on all workspaces), has a date stamp, and can be freely moved around 
your desktop. The notes are automatically saved and will reappear in their 
original locations (with their original dimensions) when the Gnome Desktop is 
restarted.
