The cuecat script repeatedly reads scan codes from a :Cue:Cat scanner
via standard input, decodes and processes the scanned value, then
prompts with Scan! for another scan code. It exists when it reads an
EOF on standard input.

It can be used print a decoded version of the scan code, or launch
commands the barcodes, ISBNs or UPCs scanned in.
