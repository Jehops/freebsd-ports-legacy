Ohcount is the source code line counter that powers Ohloh. Ohcount supports
over 70 popular programming languages, and has been used to count over 3
billion lines of code by 200,000 developers!

Ohcount does more than just count lines of code. It can also detect popular
open source licenses such as GPL within a large directory of source code.
It can also detect code that targets a particular programming API, such as
Win32 or KDE.
