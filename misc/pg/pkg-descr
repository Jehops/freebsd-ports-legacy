The pg command originates from System V and is a text file browser,
like more. It lets the user scroll forward and backward even if input
comes from a pipe. This free clone is intended to comply to the SVID 4
and SUSv2 specifications of this utility; it can handle large files as
well as files that contain multibyte characters.
