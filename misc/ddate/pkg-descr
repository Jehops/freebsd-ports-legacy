Ddate prints the date in Discordian date format.

If  called  with  no arguments, ddate will get the current system date,
convert this to the Discordian date format and print this on the  stan-
dard  output.  Alternatively,  a Gregorian date may be specified on the
command line, in the form of a numerical day, month and year.
