Before running the client for the first time, be sure to:

 1. visit the Server Uptimes project web site and register yourself
	(WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/bottom.html?show=createaccount).

 2. validate your registration
	(WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/bottom.html?show=validate).

 2. log in (WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/bottom.html?show=login).

 3. Add your host (WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/bottom.html?show=addhost).

Note that in order to send your uptime information to the uptime server,
you hosts need more-or-less full-time Internet access.

You will also have to edit /usr/local/etc/upclient.conf:

  - AuthKey is the ID you've received when you added your host
	(WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/bottom.html?show=hosts).

  - Interval is the amount of time between each update.
	(WWW: http://www.uptimes.net/stuff/protocol.html)

    Don't set this higher than 10 minutes, or else your host
    won't appear in the list.
