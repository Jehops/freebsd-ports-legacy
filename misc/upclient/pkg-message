Before running the client for the first time, be sure to:
 1. visit the Server Uptimes project web site and register yourself
        (WWW: http://uptime.hexon.cx/register.html),

 2. log in (WWW: http://uptime.hexon.cx/login)

 3. Add your host (WWW: http://uptime.hexon.cx/login/cgi-bin/addhost.cgi)

Note that in order to send your uptime information to the uptime server,
you hosts need more-or-less full-time Internet access.

You will also need to edit /usr/local/etc/upclient.conf:
HostID is the ID you've received when you added your host
Login and pass are your login and password
Interval is the amount of time between each update.
Don't set this higher than 10 minutes, or else your host
won't appear in the list.
