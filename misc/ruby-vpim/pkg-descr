This is a pure-ruby library for decoding and encoding vCard and
iCalendar data ("personal information") called vPim.

vCard (RFC 2426) is a format for personal information, see Vpim::Vcard
and Vpim::Maker::Vcard.

iCalendar (RFC 2445) is a format for calendar related information, see
Vpim::Icalendar.

vCard and iCalendar support is built on top of an implementation of
the MIME Content-Type for Directory Information (RFC 2425). The basic
RFC 2425 format is implemented by Vpim::DirectoryInfo and
Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.
