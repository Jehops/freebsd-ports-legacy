Geo::Coder::Many provides a single interface to different remote (ie HTTP based)
geocoding modules

Amongst other things, Geo::Coder::Many adds geocoder precision information,
alternative scheduling methods (weighted random, and ordered list), timeouts for
geocoders which are failing, and optional callbacks for result filtering and
picking.
