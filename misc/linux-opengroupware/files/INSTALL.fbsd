GENERAL NOTE:
=============

	You're welcome to ask questions about OpenGroupware
	at

		http://www.opengroupware.org

	too. :p Don't hesitate.
	Beside the FAQ are several mailinglists and ofcourse
	our mailinglist archive as first aid kit.

INSTALLATION WALKTHROUGH:
=========================

1)	First of all - you must have linux compat mode
	activated.

	Refer to:

	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html

	on how to do this.

	In short.... my rc.conf contains:
	
		linux_enable="YES"

	and I recompiled my kernel with the following options:

		# Enable Linux ABI emulation
		options         COMPAT_LINUX

		# Enable the linux-like proc filesystem support (requires COMPAT_LINUX
		# and PSEUDOFS)
		options         LINPROCFS

	(kernel compilation is further described in:
	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html)

	You also want to add the following line into your /etc/fstab:

		linproc                 /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs rw 0 0

	(If you don't have linproc mounted - OGo will teach you and coredump :P - so check twice)


2)	Make sure, that your PostgreSQL Installation
	listens on TCP Port 5432!

	Typing (as root)

		`netstat -an -p tcp|grep -i 5432`

	should show you if it is.
	The output might look like:

		[frank@minax]/usr/local/pgsql/data: netstat -an -p tcp|grep -i 5432
		tcp4       0      0  *.5432                 *.*                    LISTEN

	(Hoping that it is really PostgreSQL showing up there :))

		`lsof -Pni|grep -i 5432`

	should give you better results since it gives an output like this:

		[frank@minax]/usr/local/pgsql/data: lsof -Pni|grep -i 5432
		postgres  411 pgsql    3u  IPv4 0xc428cca8      0t0  TCP *:5432 (LISTEN)

	If there's no output at all (ie. nothing similiar to what you've just seen)
	then you must reconfigure PostgreSQL.
	To do so edit:

		'/usr/local/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf'

	and make sure that there's the following line activated:

		tcpip_socket = true

	After applying this modification save and exit 'postgresql.conf'.
	Now restart PostgreSQL (there should be a start/stop script in your
	local_startup dir:

		`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh stop`
		`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start`

	Voila!

3)	Add an include statement into your current apache configuration,
	typically located in:

		'/usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf'

	Edit this file and add the following line:

		'include /compat/linux/opt/opengroupware.org/OpenGroupware.org.apacheinclude'

	(best place to add this might depend on your individual configuration, in my
	configuration I simply added this line at the very end of my httpd.conf)

	Restart apache to activate the changes just made.

		`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache.sh stop`
		`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache.sh start`

4)	Add a postgresql User/Database for OpenGroupware:

		`su - pgsql`
		`createdb ogo`
		`createuser -A -D ogo`

	Install the database scheme:

		`psql ogo ogo`
		
		a shell like environment appears know... type there:

		\i /compat/linux/opt/opengroupware.org/Database/PostgreSQL/pg-build-schema.psql

		...and the basic database scheme gets installed.
		There's also a scheme with constraints in the same directory.
		It's safe to add this one too:

		\i /compat/linux/opt/opengroupware.org/Database/PostgreSQL/pg-build-schema.psql.constraints
		

		Leave this shell with

		\q

		and CTRL-D back into your `root` account.

5)	Restart PostgreSQL again.

6)	Start OpenGroupware:


		`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/ogo.sh.sample start`

7)	There are some other startscripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d too:

	nhsd.sh.sample		-	Network Hotsync (tm) Daemon
							useful if you want to use PALM [tm] Sync

	xmlrpcd.sh.sample	-	XML-RPC Daemon
							as the name says - an XMLRPC daemon

	zidestore.sh.sample	-	the famous ZideStore daemon
							necessary if you want to use thirdparty
							applications in conjunction with OGo.
							(Evolution, Mozilla, Apple iCal.app,
							KOrganizer, generic WebDAV clients ...)
