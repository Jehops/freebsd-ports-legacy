Documancer is programmer's documentation reader for Unix and Windows which has
very fast fulltext searching. It has several advantages over using web browser
or specialized format-specific viewers (such as info):
    * unified access to all documentation formats
    * the GUI is better suited for documentation reading that generic web
      browser
    * documancer can create fulltext index for the docs and enables the user
      to quickly search it
    * bookmarks and indexes are manual-specific, which reduces false matches
      and chaos in bookmarks
