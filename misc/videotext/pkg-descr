Videotext is an X11 program to display and print Videotext/Teletext
pages saved as .vtx files.
It can also drive a wide range of special teletext capture cards
(both commercial and home made)

To capture Teletext pages to disk, use the vbidecode program which
captures Teletext pages with the Bt848/Bt878 TV card/frame grabber.
