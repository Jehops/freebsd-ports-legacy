This is kp, the Keyboard Practicer.  

Kp shows a keyboard and practice text.  If you hit the right keys, the
cursor advances.  The keys you hit appear to be pushed in for your
amusement.

It also shows the next key you have to hit in reverse-video so that
you don't have to watch your fingers.  After you get rid of the habit
of watching your fingers, you can turn off the next-key showing to
perfect your typing.

Kp has a "filter" feature which will let you select the keys you want
to practice.  When this is enabled, only words entirely consisting of
those characters are displayed.
