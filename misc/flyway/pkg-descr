Flyway allows the user to find and enter U.S. waypoints (airports, navaids,
and fixes), then it calculates courses, wind corrections, and travel times.
Information about the waypoints is provided (including frequencies, elevation,
fuel availability, and runway descriptions). The route data can also be used
to fill in an editable FAA Flight Plan form, and a very rough map of the
route can be displayed.
