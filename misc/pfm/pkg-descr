pfm is a terminal (curses)-based file manager written in Perl, based on the
PFM.COM for MS-DOS (originally by Paul Culley and Henk de Heer). Permission
to use the original name was kindly granted by the original authors.

Some of its features:

    * commands are invoked with only one or two keypresses
    * colored filenames according to extension or type
    * support for executing user-defined commands (including wildcards)
      with only two keystrokes
    * a single-file and multiple-file mode
    * multilevel sorting
    * use of oldmarks and newmarks for executing multiple commands on
      the same group of files
    * supports bookmarks for directories
    * highly configurable through its config file
    * supports commandline history and completion through use of the
        readline library
    * integration with versioning tools like Subversion, CVS, Bazaar,
      Mercurial, and Git
