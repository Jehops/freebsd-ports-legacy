The GnomeSword GUI is a frontend to the SWORD project.

The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding software package
for research and study of God and His Word. The SWORD Bible Framework allows
easy manipulation of Bible texts, commentaries, lexicons, dictionaries, etc.
Many frontends are build using this framework. An installed module set may be
shared between any frontend using the framework.
