This is a port of the Slackware Linux colorized `ls' program, which is, in
turn, adapted from the `ls' program that comes with the GNU `fileutils'
package.  It is based on GNU fileutils version 3.12.  The port installs
four programs in `/usr/local/bin': `linuxls', `dir', `vdir' and
`dircolors'.  It also installs man pages for `linuxls' and `dircolors'.
The programs are compatible with their counterparts in Slackware Linux
releases.

Standard xterm prior to XFree86 3.1.2B doesn't know about colors, so
you should use color_xterm or kterm (available from the ports
collection) if you are using older versions of XFree86.

NOTES:

1. This port modifies the GNU `fileutils' make procedure (as originally
   patched for Linux) so that it installs only programs and man pages
   listed above.

2. Unlike the Slackware Linux version, this port installs `ls' as `linuxls'
   so it won't conflict with the normal BSD `ls' program or the BSD
   `colorls' program (the latter available from the ports collection).

3. This colorized `ls' program is not the same as the `colorls' program 
   available from the ports collection.
