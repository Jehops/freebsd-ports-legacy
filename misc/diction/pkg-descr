This is the snapshot release 0.6 beta of GNU diction and style, free
implementations of old standard unix commands.  For some reason,
many modern systems lack them.  Diction prints wordy and commonly
misused phrases.  Style analyses surface characteristics of a document,
e.g. sentence length and various readability measures.

Both commands support English and German documents.
