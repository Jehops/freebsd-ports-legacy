The openHAB2 user interface "Paper UI" writes to /var/db/openhab2
(config) and to %%ETCDIR%% (when installing add-onds).
The config in %%ETCDIR%% is evaluated additionally to
/var/db/openhab2.

See %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openhab2 for environment variables you need
to set by hand (all "export"-ones) if you want to execute some of
the openHAB2 commands from the shell directly.

When the openHAB2 docs talk about "userdata", look into /var/db/openhab2.
