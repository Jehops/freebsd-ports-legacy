This code provides a function, `i18n-man', with which you can browse
UNIX manual pages.  Formatting is done in background so that you
can continue to use your Emacs while processing is going on.
The mode also supports hypertext-like following of manual page SEE
ALSO references, and other features.  See below or do `?' in a
manual page buffer for details.

For working with Japanese, put your dot.emacs file to 

(load "i18n-man-ja")

Then M-x jman in minibuffer, and specify man page name.
