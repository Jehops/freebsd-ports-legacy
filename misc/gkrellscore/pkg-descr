This is a plugin for gkrellm that watches sports scores of current
games, and shows them in a panel in a form like atl 11-3 cin (Atlanta
11, Cincinatti 3). When you put the mouse over the panel for a
second, the tooltip that comes up shows the full names of both
teams, their scores, the period of the game (if applicable), the
time that it will start if it hasn't yet, the date of the game,
etc.
