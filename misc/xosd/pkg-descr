XOSD displays text on your screen; sounds simple, right?  The difference is
that it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent.  This gives the
effect of an on-screen-display, just like on your TV/VCR, etc.

The port also includes XMMS plugin, which can automatically display various
interesting things as they change (like song name and volume).
