XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right?
The difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears
transparent. This gives the effect of an On Screen Display,
like your TV/VCR etc.. The package also includes an xmms
plugin, which automatically displays various interesting
things as they change (song name, volume etc...)
