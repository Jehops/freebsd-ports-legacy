This module gets stock quotes from various internet sources, including
Yahoo!  Finance, Fidelity Investments, and the Australian Stock
Exchange.  There are two methods of using this module -- a functional
interface that is depreciated, and an object-orientated method that
provides greater flexibility and stability.
