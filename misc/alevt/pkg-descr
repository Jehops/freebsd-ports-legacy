AleVT - By Edgar Toernig

    This X11 program decodes and displays Videotext/Teletext read from
    a /dev/vbi device (for example the Bt848/Bt878 frame grabber)


    It features multiple windows, a page cache, regexp searching, built-in
    manual, and more.
    There's also a program to get the time from teletext.
