Mister Proper is a GNOME application designed to manage cyclic tasks. It was
especially designed to keep your house clean with the best possible tidying
organization.
		 
Although Mister Proper is really handy as a time-scheduler for your home
tidying, it is also good at any cyclic task such as going to the doctor's,
giving your grandmother a phone call, and so on.

English and French locales are supported. If you are able to translate this
