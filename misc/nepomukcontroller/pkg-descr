Nepomukcontroller is a small systray applet that allows you to
suspend and resume the Nepomuk file indexer.

The systray was removed from KDE 4.6 to be ported to a stand-alone
app which was not finished before the feature freeze. Thus, this
applet will be merged back into kdebase for KDE 4.7. In the meantime
you can use it from here.
