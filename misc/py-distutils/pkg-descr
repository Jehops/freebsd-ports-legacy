The Python Module Distribution Utilities, or Distutils for short, are a
collection of modules that aid in the development, distribution, and
installation of Python modules.

The Distutils will be a standard part of Python 1.6.  This release is
intended to provide a wider audience an early opportunity to try out the
system, improve its portability, shake out the bugs, make suggestions,
and so forth.  Do not expect perfection: if you're trying out this
release, it should be because you want to help debug and develop, not
because you need a stable, working system immediately.

Any feedback, comments, bug reports, success reports, etc. should be
reported to the Distutils SIG at <distutils-sig@python.org>
