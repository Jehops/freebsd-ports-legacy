From libfirestring(3):

"libfirestring is a string handling library that provides
maximum length aware string handling functions to programs.
Several functions provide saner interfaces than the standard
libc functions.  libfirestring also provides functions that
are in most libc's but not provided for by POSIX, enabling
programmers to write POSIX-compliant code while using such
safe functions (strcasecmp, strncasecmp, snprintf).

"libfirestring also includes functions for dealing with
reading configuration files in an easy to program fashion."
