KBFX is an alternative to the classical K-Menu button and it's menu.
It improves the user experience by enabling the user to set a bigger start
button and by finally replacing the Win95-like K-Menu. But if you still want
the old menu, because you're used to it, it is still available as an option
in kbfx.
