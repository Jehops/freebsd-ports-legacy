The sysinstall2 project (aka libh) is the next generation 
sysinstall replacement.  The libh project aims to produce
a robust installation and administration tool, which will
provide several flexible user interfaces and an advanced 
package management system.

The name libh comes from the prefix of the shared library
filenames and the original author packaged his first pre-alpha 
release as libh.tar.gz.
