The purpose of salias is to provide an aliasing system for programs where
arguments may wish to be aliased. This is more useful than just a shell
environment variable as an argument, since it can ``repeat'' options, such
as GnuPG's --recipient option as needed. Also, unlike shell enviornment
variables, it can be used transparently inside of other programs,
strengthening it's drop-in capabilities.

salias was initially designed for wrapping around GnuPG, providing aliases
for keys. However, the design easily extends to being useful for all types
of programs.
