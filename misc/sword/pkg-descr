The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding software
package for research and study of God and His Word. The SWORD Bible
Framework allows easy manipulation of Bible texts, commentaries,
lexicons, dictionaries, etc.  Many frontends are built using this
framework. An installed module set may be shared between many
frontends using the framework.
