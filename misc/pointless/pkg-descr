Pointless is a presentation tool primarily targeted at the un*x
world. Presentations are made using a simple markup-language (best
described as a mix between TeX and Pod, and affectionately known as
"The Pointless Language"). The resulting slideshow is rendered using
FreeType and OpenGL for optimal visual quality. Hardware accelerated
OpenGL is highly recommended but not required in order to run
pointless.
