The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary English
text into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect.
These filters have been in the public domain for many years, but now for
the first time they are provided as a single integrated package. The
filters include b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, fudd, funetak,
jethro, jive, kraut, pansy, postmodern, redneck, valspeak, and warez.
Each program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
