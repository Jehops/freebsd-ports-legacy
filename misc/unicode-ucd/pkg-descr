The Unicode Character Database (UCD) consists of a number of data files
listing Unicode character properties and related data. It also includes
data files containing test data for conformance to several important
Unicode algorithms.

This package contains Unihan.zip which contains the data files for the
Unified Han database of Hanzi/Kanji/Hanja Chinese characters.
