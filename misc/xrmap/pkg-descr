Xrmap is a small program that can read a custom format of the CIA
world data bank II global vector information to generate images of
the Earth under the X Window system. The images can be very accurately
zoomed in, up to a factor of 100 or more.  There is a variety of
options and parameters to control the output of the image, including
the selection of geographic features to be displayed and their
colors.  All parameters can be adjusted interactively either from
the builtin command line widget or from the mouse.
