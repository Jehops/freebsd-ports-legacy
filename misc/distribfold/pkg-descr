This is the distribfold.org's client. 

It makes protein structures to help sample the enormous size of
protein conformatoinal space. We hope to find a few good samples
and understand how a large computation can help crack the problem
of predicting protein structure - the protein folding problem.

Proteins have a vast number of folds, larger than we could hope to
compute even with distributed computing. Usually only one fold is
found in nature. The Distributed Folding Project aims to test our
new protein folding algorithm. We want see if it can reproduce
natural protein folds after making extremely large samples of many
different folds.

With your help, we will create the largest samples of protein folds
ever computed. First we will make 1 Billion (1,000,000,000) folds
for 5 small proteins, then we will try 10 Billion (10,000,000,000)
for another 10 large proteins. By the end of our first phase, we
hope to make over 100 Billion protein folds spanning 15 different
proteins.
