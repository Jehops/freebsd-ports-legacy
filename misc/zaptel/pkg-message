IMPORTANT! MAKE SURE TO READ THE FOLLOWING!

To use the driver, make a copy of %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/zaptel.sh.sample
under %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/zaptel.sh.

To load the driver run (as root):

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/zaptel.sh start

To unload it:

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/zaptel.sh stop

It'll also load the driver automatically when the system is started.

Report problems to Alexander Timoshenko <gonzo@portaone.com>. Please note that
it is still "work in progress" so that your bug reports are welcome and will
help to improve quality of the drivers.

Great thanks to all companies and individuals who made this driver happen,
including but not limited to, John Todd, Chris Coleman, Alexander Timoshenko,
Porta Software Ltd and others contributors of the bounty project.

Also, we would be grateful if anyone who uses this driver can send a short
note to DigiumBSD@portaone.com, with brief description of what X100P is used
for as well as with extimated number of cards deployed under FreeBSD. We will
use this information to persuage Digium that in the order to sell more
hardware they have to support FreeBSD drivers along with Linux ones.

Thanks and enjoy!
