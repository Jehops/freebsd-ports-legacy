Scour is now successfully installed.

You can use it either as a standalone program or as a browser plug-in.

Standalone: 
===========
When you find a file you want to look at on the Scour site, click on it
to download it.  Netscape will pop up a "save as" dialog to ask you where
to save a file called "smadlc".  Save it anywhere, then from a command line
type "sma /path/to/smadlc" (example: if you saved it as /tmp/smadlc, type
"sma /tmp/smadlc")

Netscape plug-in:
=================
In the Preferences dialog, click through to the "Navigator/Applications"
hierarchy.  Click the "New" button and fill out the dialog as follows:

Description: Scour Media Agent
MIMEType: application/x-scour-directive
Suffixes: sma
Handled by: Check "Application", and in the box, enter "sma %s"

Lynx plug-in:
=============
Add the following line to the lynx.cfg file:
VIEWER:application/x-scour-directive:sma %s

You will also need to install programs for whichever media type(s) you wish
to be able to view.  Look around in the /usr/ports hierarchy.

Now go on over to http://www.scour.net/ and use it!
