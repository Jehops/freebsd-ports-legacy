The Scour Media Agent (SMA) is a program that is used in conjunction with
the Scour search service (http://www.scour.net/).  This is a new kind of
search service that specializes in searching for multimedia filetypes
(video, animation, audio, etc.).  They search 6 different protocols and have
the most comprehensive webcrawlers of any search engine presently in
existence.  The database contains everything from links to streaming video
lectures on Microbiology (coming soon) to the latest music video from the
Spice Girls.

They specialize even further by separating media files into their respective
types (.avi, .mpg, .mov, .viv, .ram, .mp3, etc.)  So, going beyond just
being able to search for video files, you can specify all the way down to
the file type.

This free service started out as a dorm room project by a couple of Computer
Science students at UCLA.
