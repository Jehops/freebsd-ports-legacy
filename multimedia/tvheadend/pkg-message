============================================================================

PLEASE BEWARE that tvheadend is quite new on FreeBSD and has
not received a lot of testing yet. It might break for you and
kill kenny or spill your beer so don't expect too much.

Known issues:
- no libav support
- no libdvbcsa support

For the first start in your /etc/rc.conf:
  tvheadend_enable="YES"
  tvheadend_flags="-C"

The second line can be removed after the first start.

Patches, feedback and help are always welcome!
