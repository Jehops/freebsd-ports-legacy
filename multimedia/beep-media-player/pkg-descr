BMP, or Beep Media Player, is a compact media player that was originally
forked from XMMS with the goal of porting XMMS to GTK2 and make use of
more modern desktop standards. The original XMMS is based on GTK 1.2,
which is now deprecated for roughly 4 years, and was deprecated at the
time of the fork for approximately 2 years. This, and the fact that the
developers were developing XMMS under a mostly cathedral-style model led
M. Derezynski to fork BMP from XMMS.

BMP was discontinued in October 2005 with version 0.9.7.1 being
the last one. There is a fork off 0.9.7.1 in multimedia/audacious
and a completely new version of BMP in multimedia/bmpx.
