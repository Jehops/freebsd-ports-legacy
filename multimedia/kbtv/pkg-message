====================================================================
Before you can sucessfully run kbtv, you must run btsetup as root or
manually set up correct module loading, device permissions (use the 
operator group, not wheel), group membership, and if needed sysctls.

Consult the README on how to use btsetup. For the impatient: on the 
btsetup prompt you first issue kldload commands if needed, then 
sysctl commands if needed, then the commit command, and finally the 
adduser command. Use show to see current status, help when lost.

For BrookTree/Conexant BT8x8 the bktr module should be loaded, for 
Philips SAA713x the saa module should be loaded, for Philips and 
compatible USB cameras the pwc module should be loaded.

If you're having trouble, please look at the (KDE) documentation and
the README first, before asking me. Thanks.
