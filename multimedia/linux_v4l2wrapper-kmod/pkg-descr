This kld adds V4L2 ioctl handling to the Linux compatibility layer
so that Linux apps like Skype or Flash can talk to V4L2 devices
(like webcams) via /dev/videoX.  The patches this kld is based on
have been committed to FreeBSD 9.0-current (r221426) and 8.2-stable
(r222914) so this port is only needed on eaerlier versions.

Note this port does not contain actual V4L2 drivers, those are
provided by e.g. the multimedia/webcamd port.
