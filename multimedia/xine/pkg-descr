xine is a free video player for unix-like systems, which plays mpeg-2 and
mpeg-1 system (audio + video multiplexed) streams, eventually mpeg-4 and
other formats might be added.

xine plays the video and audio data of mpeg-2 videos and synchronizes
the playback of both.  Depending on the properties of the mpeg stream,
playback will need more or less processor power, 100% frame rate
has been seen on a 667 MHz P III system.

xine can play Video CDs and DVDs directly (but only unlocked, unencrypted
DVDs for obvious - legal - reasons, see the FAQ or homepage for a
discussion of this subject).
