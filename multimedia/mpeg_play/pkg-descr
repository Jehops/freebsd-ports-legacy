This is mpeg_play 2.0, which will let you view mpeg movies on X window
displays.  It is not the latest version (2.0.1) available from the
X11R6 contrib sites, as that one requires Motif. :<

It also includes a patch I picked up on Usenet that will make it work
on 15/16 bit displays.  Just try it with "-dither color".  It shows up
in all green on my 16-bit display, though. :<
