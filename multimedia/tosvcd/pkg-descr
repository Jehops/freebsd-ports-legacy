tosvcd takes one or more recorded vdr files and transcodes them to a SVCD
image file ready for cdrdao to burn.

Some functions:
   * synchronises Video/Audio
   * tries to repair demaged streams
   * split output(with help of mpeg2enc)
   * invoke yuvscaler, if input is not 480x576
   * invoke noise filter on request
   * predicts finish time
   * predicts final output size
   * restarts if output size exceeds CD's capacity to enable full automatic
     operation
   * invoke mplex and vcdimager
