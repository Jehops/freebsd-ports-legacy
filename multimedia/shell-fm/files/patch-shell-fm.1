+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm shell-fm
+is a console based player for the streams provided by Last.FM. It's
+lightweight, easy to use and under heavy development. New features might
+be added every day.
+.Nm shell-fm
+is Open Source and published under the terms of the GNU General Public
+License, so feel free to modify and/or redistribute it.
+.Sh RUNNINF SHELL-FM
+Usage of 
+.Nm shell-fm
+is pretty simple. To tell 
+.Nm shell-fm
+what to play, you simply give it the direct link to a Last.FM stream (a
+URL starting with lastfm://). The URLs are very clear and easy to
+understand. Here are some examples:
+.Pp
+.nf
+    lastfm://user/shell-monkey/personal     - my personal radio
+    lastfm://user/shell-monkey/loved        - my loved tracks radio
+    lastfm://artist/Blood For Blood/similar - bands similar to Blood For
+                                              Blood
+    lastfm://artist/The Distillers/fans     - The Distillers fan radio
+    lastfm://globaltags/punk rock           - songs that have been
+                                              tagged as "punk rock" 
+.fi
+.Pp 
+Radios can be specified in three ways. First you can give a stream URL
+as command line argument to 
+.Nm shell-fm
+:
+.Pp
+[~]$ shell-fm "lastfm://artist/The Distillers/fans"
+.Pp
+Note that you need to quote the URL, if it contains white spaces.
+.br
+Next you can enter a new URL while 
+.Nm shell-fm
+is already running by pressing the r key.
+.Nm shell-fm
+then will prompt you for a new URL. Note that you don't need / may not
+quote the URL here like in the command line. 
+.Nm shell-fm 
+will take care of whitespaces for you.  Finally, you can name a default
+stream in your configuration file, which is started by default if you
+run
+.Nm shell-fm
+without an URL as command line argument.
+.Sh CONFIGURATION
+Your configuration should be placed in the file ~/.shell-fm/shell-fm.rc.
+It consists of simple associations in the format key = value. Following
+keys are known at the moment (may/will be more in future).
+.br
+.nf
+  username       - your Last.FM nick
+  password       - your Last.FM password; if password and username or
+                   only the password are missing here, shell-fm will
+                   prompt you for it on startup.
+  default-radio  - the default radio which shell-fm will play on startup
+                   if you called it without an command line argument.
+  np-file        - the (absolute) path to a file in which you want
+                   shell-fm to save information about the currently
+                   played track in.
+  np-file-format - the format in which shell-fm will write the song
+                   information to your np-file. Note that both, np-file
+                   and np-file-format need to be specified to make
+                   shell-fm write to the np-file. The format may contain
+                   any character plus some placeholders shell-fm will
+                   replace. They are: 
+                        %a - artist
+                        %t - title
+                        %A - album
+                        %d - duration in seconds
+                        %s - station name
+                        %u - station URL
+                        %U - artist URL
+                        %T - track URL
+.fi
+.Pp
+There may and will be more placeholders available in future releases. 
+.br
+.nf
+    np-cmd  - command that's executed whenever the track changes. Allows
+              the same format placeholders as the "np-file-format"
+              option. 
+    key0x?? - bind an external command to the key with the hexadecimal,
+              UPPERCASE (!), zero-padded ASCII code "??". Keys that are
+              already bound to an action (as listed here) can't be
+              overwritten. Again, you can use all the variables as in
+              "np-file-format" and "np-cmp". Please note that future
+              versions may use further keys, so you might need to change
+              your configuration then. 
+    ?-color - (where ? is one of the meta tag variables (see list
+              above). This allows you to color every kind of tag with a
+              different color (e.g. paint track titles red, artists
+              green and so on). This is the list of valid color codes:
+                   0;30 = black (not very useful)
+                   1;30 = dark gray
+                   0;31 = red
+                   1;31 = light red
+                   0;32 = green
+                   1;32 = light green
+                   0;33 = dark yellow/brown
+                   1;33 = yellow
+                   0;34 = blue
+                   1;34 = light blue
+                   0;35 = violet
+                   1;35 = pink
+                   0;36 = turquoise
+                   1;36 = cyan
+                   0;37 = gray
+                   1;37 = white
+.fi
+.Pp
+This is what your configuration file for 
+.Nm shell-fm 
+could look like: 
+.nf
+    [~]$ cat ~/.shell-fm/shell-fm.rc
+    username = shell-monkey
+    password = secret
+    default-radio = lastfm://user/shell-monkey/loved
+    np-file = /tmp/np.txt
+    np-file-format = %a - %t
+    key0x6F = /usr/bin/elinks "%u"
+    t-color = 1;32
+    a-color = 0;32
+    s-color = 1;37
+    [~]$ 
+.fi
+.Sh CONTROLS
+These keys are available from within
+.Nm shell-fm
+to control it's behaviour:
+.br
+.nf
+    r - prompt for a new station URL.
+    l - love the currently played track.
+    B - (uppercase!) ban the currently played track.
+    n - skip the currently played track.
+    Q - (uppercase!) quit.
+    d - enable/disable discovery mode. 
+    A - ban the artist of the currently played track (whenever another
+        track of this artist is streamed again, it will be banned
+        automatically).
+    R - toggle RTP on/off (RTP = record tracks to profile)
+    f - listen to the fan radio of the currently played tracks artist
+    s - listen to the similar-artists radio of the currently played
+        tracks artist
+.fi
+.br
+Note that the radio URL prompt provides a simple history (use up/down
+arrow keys to browse it). By default, 
+.Nm Shell.FM
+will remember only the URLs you entered in the current session. If you
+want the history to survive, you need to create an empty file name
+~/.shell-fm/radio-history. Simply touch(1) it and you're done.
