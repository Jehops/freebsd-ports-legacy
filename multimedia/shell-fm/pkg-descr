This is a port of Shell.FM, a console based player for the streams
provided by Last.FM for the Linux platform. It's lightweight (the binary
is only about 16K), easy to use and under heavy development. New
features might be added every day. Shell.FM is Open Source and published
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, so feel free to
modify and/or redistribute it.
