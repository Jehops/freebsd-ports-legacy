Hayes is the playlist for Noatun 2 / KDE 3 that attempts to be 
efficent for those users with large directories full of music, 
especially directories futher organized by album. For these 
users, Hayes should be more efficient in speed and memory 
than the usual playlist. Plus, the playlist is updated in 
realtime as the directories change on-disk, so playlist 
maintenance is no longer an issue.
