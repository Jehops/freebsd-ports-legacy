This port provides a simple and easy to use
tool to provide fonts in OSD.
Just cd to the ports directory and type

make install-user

Note: This is only for the bitmap fonts! If you've compiled
mplayer with truetype supprt, this won't work.

Please take a look at docs in
/usr/local/share/doc/mplayer

You can download skins from the mplayer homepage:

In order to use DVD please make sure that your
kernel and base system is newer than 2001-09-25,
otherwise DVD play will not work!
