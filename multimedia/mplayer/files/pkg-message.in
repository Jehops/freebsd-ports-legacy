MPlayer's comprehensive documentation covers many topics like
output devices, video encoding, repairing broken files etc.
It is auto-generated daily and can be found on the project
homepage in the documentation section:

MPlayer's system-wide configuration dir is

%%PREFIX%%/etc/mplayer

If you want to install configuration files into this location
in order to change mplayer's default settings for all users on
your system, you find some examples in

%%DATADIR%%/examples/etc
===================================================================
If seeking in streams causes the playback volume to be reset to
the previous setting (on 8.x or newer system with VPC enabled),
you and you dislike this behaviour, you have two options:
- Use mplayer's -softvol command line option
- Set the sysctl hw.snd.vpc_autoreset to 0
===================================================================
ffmpeg's ogg demuxer is currently broken for ogg streams.
A possible workaround is the command line option'-demuxer ogg' when
playing these streams.
