MythVideo allows for cataloguing and playback of a variety of video
file formats. It can perform automatic metadata look ups on
themoviedb.org  or The TV DB as well as retrieve poster, fanart,
banner, and screenshot artwork. You can also add your own Meta data
to your own videos and add custom poster artwork to videos.
