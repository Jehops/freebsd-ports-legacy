BMPx is an audio player that can be either used with a built-in
frontend which currently utilizes Winamp 2.x compatible skins, or
as a daemon for other frontends to connect via a DBus interface.
It can run under X11 with graphical GUIs, or without X under 
plain UNIX terminal as a daemon (in which case it requires a 
different frontend connecting to it via DBus).
