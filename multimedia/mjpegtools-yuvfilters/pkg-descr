Mjpegtools YUV video stream processing tools

yuvdeinterlace:
  A non destructive deinterlacer. Converts to a double frame rate, alf height,
  progressive yuv stream for further processing by temporal based filters.
  Then re-interlaced before encoding. The reinterlacer doesn't exist at this
  time.

yuvafps:
  A linear frame averaging, frame rate converter. Does a better job than the
  frame dropping/duplicating converters.

yuvfade:
  Will fade the video to black after X number of frames. Uses a trial and
  error method of fading to black

yuvwater:
  Attempts to detect and remove semi-transperant watermarks from the source.
  Produces a PGM file of the detected watermark which is used to remove or
  reduce the effect.
