Emby Server uses ffmpeg for transcoding, which by default has
lame support disabled due to licensing issues. To enable mp3
audio when transcoding, you must reinstall multimedia/ffmpeg
from ports with the lame support option enabled.

If you had mediabrowser installed before the project was
renamed to emby-server, you may want to rename the user and
group (note that moving the database is not supported):
# pw groupmod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby
# pw usermod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby -g emby -c Emby\ Server

To automatically start Emby Server at boot time:
# echo 'emby_server_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

To then manually start Emby Server without rebooting:
# service emby-server start

Once started, visit the following webpage to configure:
http://localhost:8096/
