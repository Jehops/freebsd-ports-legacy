vlc -- the VideoLAN Client

The vlc is distributed with a GPL license.  See the file COPYING in the
base directory.

The vlc is part of the VideoLAN project, a full MPEG2 client/server
solution. The VideoLAN Client can also be used as a standalone program
to play MPEG2 streams from a hard disk or a DVD.

vlc@videolan.org is a mailing list for support and discussion

The VideoLAN web site at http://www.videolan.org/ is a good start for
information about MPEG and DVD playing. Have a look at the documentation
section (http://www.videolan.org/doc.html), as well as the bookmarks.
