The goal of gst-editor is to provide View and Controller counterparts
to GStreamer's Model. It mirrors the state of GStreamer pipelines,
and can be used to modify pipeline topology, state, and properties.
Furthermore, it provides an interface to GStreamer's XML pipeline
(de)serialization code, and a few more goodies.
