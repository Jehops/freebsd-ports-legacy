WMxmms is little dockapp in the style of wmusic and wmapmload/wmcpuload.
It represents a fairly complete interface to XMMS including reflecting
states set from the XMMS console.

Credits go to Thomas Nemeth who came up with the LCD type design and
Hades (hadess@hadess.net) who wrote xmusic and thus provided the
inspiration for this one.
