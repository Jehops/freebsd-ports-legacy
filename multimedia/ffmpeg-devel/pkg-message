	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

ffmpeg users have reported that older version 0.4.5 encodes faster
than later ffmpeg versions. Therefore, it might prove better for
capturing purposes with Brooktree bktr(4) devices. So, if you want
the additional speed, you might want to try using the ffmpeg045
port. The current ffmpeg port should be used for all other purposes
unless you really need the additional speed.

Do not install both ports at the same time. They install conflicting
files.

- ffmpeg 0.4.5
ports/multimedia/ffmpeg045

- ffmpeg current
ports/multimedia/ffmpeg
