[ excerpt from distfile's README with modifications ]

dvdwizard is a wrapper-script which incorporates a fully automated
creation of a DVD-structure with Chapters and menus from one or
more mpeg-streams. This is done by several "sub-scripts" and various
freely available tools.

A lot of things have changed since the initial version. It is now
possible to author multiple titlesets at once, PAL or NTSC is
supported. If the movie has more than one audio stream, an audio
selection menu will be shown, languages of audio tracks are now
freely customizable. Also, a configuration file has been introduced.
