Kdenlive is a non-linear video editor for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, which 
supports DV, AVCHD (experimental support) and HDV editing. Kdenlive relies 
on several other open source projects, such as FFmpeg and the MLT video 
framework. It was designed to answer all needs, from basic video editing to 
semi-professional work.
