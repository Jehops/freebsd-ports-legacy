Kdenlive is a non-linear video editor for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD,
which supports DV, HDV and AVCHD (not complete yet) editing. Kdenlive
relies on several other open source projects like FFmpeg and the
MLT video framework.  It was designed to answer all needs, from
basic video editing to semi-professional work.
