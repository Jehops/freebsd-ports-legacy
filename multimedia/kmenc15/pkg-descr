[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Kmenc15 is an advanced MEncoder frontend, generally designed to be
a VirtualDub replacement for Linux. It is most useful for editing
and encoding large high quality AVIs capped from TV. It allows
cutting and merging at exact frames, applying any MPlayer/MEncoder
filter, with preview.
