ManDVD is an application for creating video DVDs from a wide variety of
video formats.  You can add as many video clips you want to generate a DVD
with chapters, subtitles, transition effects, brightness and contrast
settings.

If the imported videos are not compatible with standard DVDs, they can be
converted.  It also offers the possibility of extracting images, synchronize
audio and video, create a video introduction to the DVD, reduce the noise,
create subtitles, and even a menu with animation for your DVD.
