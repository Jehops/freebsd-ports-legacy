   Fxtv is an X11-based FreeBSD app that provides TV-in-a-window and
   image/audio/video capture capabilities for Bt848-based tuner/capture
   cards.

   To use this app, you need FreeBSD 2.2 or 3.0-current as well as a
   capture card based on the Brooktree 848 chip. Examples include the
   Hauppauge Wincast/TV, the STB TV PCI, and the Intel Smart Video
   Recorder III.
