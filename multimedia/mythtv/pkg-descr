MythTV is a "Personal Video Recorder", i.e. a computer-based video
recorder.  It supports pausing and rewinding live TV, multiple tuner
cards, hardware or software video compression, onscreen program guides
and a distributed architecture.

The current distributed version of MythTV
(http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownload&cid=1)
is out of date for just about all platforms.  It is also protocol
incompatible with the "bug fix" version, which is maintained under
subversion, rather like the FreeBSD -STABLE branch.  This port is a
snapshot of svn version 13053, dated 15 March 2007.  Later versions of
this tree are no longer compatible with this port.

MythTV requires tuner drivers which support the V4L standard.
Currently no official FreeBSD driver does so, but the latest version
of a beta version of the cxm driver is available from
http://usleepless.110mb.com/pvrxxx_port-10042007.tgz.  Problems have
been reported with this port; if you use it, you should join the
FreeBSD-multimedia mailing list and report where appropriate.
