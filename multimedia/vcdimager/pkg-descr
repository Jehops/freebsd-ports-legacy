VCDImager is a "little" program which allows direct making of VideoCD
BIN/CUE CD images from MPEG files, which can be played on standalone
VCD players or DVD players.  BIN/CUE images can be burned with cdrdao.

VCDImager supports the VideoCD 1.1, VideoCD 2.0 audn Super VideoCD 2.0
standards.

Also included in the package is the vcdrip-tool, which performs the
opposite task.

This set actually consists of a backend library and a commandline
frontend for it.
