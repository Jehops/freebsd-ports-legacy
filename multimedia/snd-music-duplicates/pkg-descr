Seek & Destroy Music Duplicates is a tool for locating and removing
duplicated music files. It does not crash on corrupted files and
normally suggests the best song from amongst the duplicates. It uses
an incremental scanning strategy and uses relatively few system
resources. MP3, Ogg, WMA, and AAC formats are supported.
