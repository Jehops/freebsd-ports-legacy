This port contains:

- Drivers for the Conexant MPEG-2 Codec driver which can be found
  on the Hauppauge PVR-250/350 TV cards.
  These drivers are (c) John Wehle <john@feith.com>

  On FreeBSD 4.x, the device used is /dev/bktr0.
  On FreeBSD 5.x, the device used is /dev/cxm0

  This driver has been successfully tested on:
  - FreeBSD 4.10
  - FreeBSD 5.2.1

- Two simple programs to modify some ioctls on the card: set the
  channel and set the window size.

Note:

- The configuration screen is only applicable for the the Philips
  FQ1216M tuner. For other tuners ignore this section. Select just
  one entry.

- Note: the maintainer of this port has no inside knowledge of the
  workings of this software. Please don't contact me about cards
  which don't work. Please contact me about problems with the port,
  with possible enhancements, with success stories.
