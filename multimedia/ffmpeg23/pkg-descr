FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream
audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec
library.

This version is a legacy version from the 2.3 release branch. It is
intended to be used by ports which absolutely have to depend on deprecated
APIs that have been removed in 2.4 or later releases.
