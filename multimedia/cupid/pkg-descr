[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Cupid is a modern, complete video/audio capture solution for the
Linux/GNOME desktop. It is based on the GStreamer multimedia
framework, which is the de facto multimedia framework on the Linux
and UNIX desktop. Using GStreamer, it supports a variety of container
formats and video/audio codecs. Likewise, it supports all the current
video and audio kernel interfaces, and can be extended to supports
other systems than Linux simply by writing a GStreamer plugin.
