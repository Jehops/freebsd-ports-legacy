***********************************************************************

  Freevo is now installed.  It might be a good idea to read the docs
  in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/freevo-1.5-rc4

  By default Freevo is configured with a single VFS in /var/db/cache.
  You can use this by adding users to the freevo group.

  To get up and running quickly try: freevo setup && freevo --help

  Freevo can be configured to start on boot by using the sample
  startup script in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/freevo.sh.sample

***********************************************************************

  IMPORTANT: Freevo requires procfs to be mounted on /proc. You can
  do this by adding the following entry to your /etc/fstab:

    proc	/proc	procfs	rw	1 1

  WITHOUT THIS FREEVO WILL NOT SHUT DOWN CORRECTLY!
