Webcamd is a 500KiloByte daemon that enables use of hundreds of different USB 
based webcam devices under the FreeBSD-8/9 operating system. The webcam daemon 
is basically an application which is a port of Video4Linux USB webcam drivers 
into userspace on FreeBSD. The daemon currently depends on libc, pthreads, 
libusb and the VIDEO4BSD kernel module.
