Universal Media Server (UMS) can be enabled with the following way:

  sysrc   %%RCNAME%%_enable=YES
  service %%RCNAME%% start

For more configuration options, see the file:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/%%RCNAME%%

The UMS profile directory, where exists UMS.conf, is located at:

  %%UMS_PROFILE_PATH%%/

Log files are located at:

  %%UMS_LOG_DIR%%/UMS.log
  %%UMS_PROFILE_PATH%%/debug.log

NOTE: None of the following transcoders are installed by default
ffmpeg, mplayer, vlc, mencoder, linux-tsmuxer

These missing transcoders each have a lot of dependancies of their 
own. That is why they are not included by default with UMS.
UMS will automatically detect any missing transcoder once it has
been installed. Either from the ports tree or pkgng.

NOTE: 'mencoder' is license restricted and therefore NOT available 
from pkgng. But it can be installed from the ports tree instead.

NOTE: 'tsmuxer' requires the kernel module 'linux.ko' to be loaded.

To install all missing transcoders: (beware, many dependancies)

  pkg install ffmpeg mplayer vlc linux-tsmuxer
  sysrc linux_enable=YES && kldload linux.ko
  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mencoder && BATCH=YES make install
  service %%RCNAME%% restart
