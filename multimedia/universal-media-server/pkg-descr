Universal Media Server (UMS) is a feature-rich DLNA/UPnP home media
server, with good support for client devices.

A popular fork / successor of PS3 Media Server. UMS is Java-based. 
The program streams or transcodes with little or no configuration.

Powered by MEncoder, FFmpeg, tsMuxeR, AviSynth, MediaInfo and more,
which combine to offer support for a wide range of media formats.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

All the missing transcoder dependancies CAN be installed seperately.
NOT needed to re-build this port from scratch to select options.

Please read: 'files/pkg-message.in' in the port directory for more
information about how to best install these missing dependancies.
