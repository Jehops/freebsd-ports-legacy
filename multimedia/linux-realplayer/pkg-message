HINT: 

If you experience crashes, try setting the
audio driver option under

   view->Preference->Performance->Audio Driver Options

to 

   "Enable support for old OSS drivers"
 

Take the following hint  with a grain of salt:

After install goto ${PREFIX}/lib/RealPlayer8 directory
(as user) and launch:
  ./mimeinstall.sh - for install mime types for the mail and 
                     browser
  ./plugininstall.sh - for install plugin for the Linux 
                       Netscape
