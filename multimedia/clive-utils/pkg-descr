clive-utils contains additional utilities that can be used together with 
clive(1) (Historically, these utilities were part of clive(1) 1.x and were
written in Python/Newt; they have now been rewritten in Perl/Tk to replace
the features that were removed in clive 2.0):

-clivefeed(1), a utility that parses RSS feeds containing video page links
	and uses clive(1) to extract them;

-clivescan(1), a utility that scans video pages for video links and uses
	clive(1) to extract them; and

-clivepass(1), a utility that can be used to create and change passwords
	for websites used by clive(1). The passwords are encrypted and
	saved along with the username information. Access is restricted
	by using a global passphrase.
