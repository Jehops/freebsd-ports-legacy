	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

ffmpeg users have reported that older version 0.4.5 encodes faster
than later ffmpeg versions. Therefore, it might prove better for
capturing purporses with Brooktree bktr(4) devices. The current
ffmpeg port should be used for all other purposes unless you really
need the additional speed.

Do not install both ports at the same time. They install conflicting
files.

- ffmpeg 0.4.5
ports/multimedia/ffmpeg045

- ffmpeg current
ports/multimedia/ffmpeg
