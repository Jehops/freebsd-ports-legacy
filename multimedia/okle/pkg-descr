This is a Graphical Interface for Ogle.

It is oKle is a KDE frontend to the Ogle DVD player both visually
and functionally resembling the one from graphics/ogle-gui port.

It is very helpful if you would rather use a KDE based frontend
than the ogle-gui Glade (which incidently installs Gnome Libraries)
based one.
