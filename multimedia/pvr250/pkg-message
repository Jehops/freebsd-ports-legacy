PVR-250/350 - Nearly done!

If you haven't patched /usr/src/sys/dev/iicbus/iicbb.c yet, and
rebuild a new kernel, and rebooted, these are the following steps:

    - Run "make patch-iicbb". This will enable cxm to use the i2c bus.
    - Add this to your kernel configuration file:
	    DEVICE	iicbus
	    DEVICE	iicbb
    - Rebuild your kernel.
    - Reboot.

Next step is to load the drivers:
    - Run "kldload cxm_iic"
    - Run "kldload cxm"

Check your console (or /var/log/messages if you're running X) and
you should see something like:

    cxm0: <Conexant iTVC15 MPEG Coder> mem ... irq ... at device ... on pci ...
    cxm_iic0: <Conexant iTVC15 / iTVC16 I2C cnotroller> on cxm0
    iicbb0: <I2C bit-banging driver> on cxm_iic0
    cxm0: Philips FI1236M K2 Tuner
    cxm0: SAA7115 rev 1 video decoder
    cxm0: MSP3435G-B6 audio decoder
    cxm0: IR Remote

To test the card, either do "cat /dev/bktr0 > filename.mpg" (FreeBSD
4.x) or "cat /dev/cxm0 > filename.mpg" (FreeBSD 5.x).
