The bsdav package is a set of programs for audio and video reading and writing.
The programs use BSD native devices and the source code is free-as-in-BSD
licensed as well.The bsdav package also includes a general purpose library,
libbsdav, for both accessing audio(4) and bktr(4) devices, and simple data
operations. While one of the goals of the bsdav project is simplicity, another
goal is to make A/V processing on *BSD systems "easily" accessible. So to ease
the storage and synchronization of both audio and video streams, bsdav has it's
own, very simple, A/V container format. Hopefully the bsdav programs are
written understandably and correclty enough that they may help others
understand how to use audio(4) and bktr(4).

bsdav consists of:
        audiorec - record raw audio streams from audio(4) to file
        bktrrec - record raw video streams from bktr(4) to file
        avplay - play raw audio and/or raw video streams
        bktrplay - display video from bktr(4) via Xv(3X)
        tunerctl - manipulate bktr(4) tuner devices
        bsdavrec - records audio and/or video in bsdav(5) streams
        bsdavplay - play audio and/or video in bsdav(5) streams
        bsdavdemux - extract audio and/or video from bsdav(5) streams
        btv - shell script frontend for the above programs
        libbsdav - general purpose *BSD A/V library
