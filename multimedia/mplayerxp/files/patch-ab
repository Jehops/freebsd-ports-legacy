  2. To run mplayer you will need to re-compile the kernel with 
  "options USER_LDT" (unless you are running -CURRENT, where this is default).
+ If you have a CPU with SSE also use "options CPU_ENABLE_SSE" to use it
+ (FreeBSD-STABLE required, or use kernel patches).
  
  3. If mplayer complains about "CD-ROM Device '/dev/cdrom' not found!" make a 
  symbolic link : ln -s /dev/<your_cdrom_device> /dev/cdrom
