This is a PVR add-on for XBMC to add VDR (http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr)
as a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It adds support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings,
programming Timers and EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or over
the Network.

This add-on requires the installed "vdr-plugin-xvdr" plugin on the
VDR server.  VDR itself doen't need any patches or modification to
use all the current features.
