MediaBrowser uses ffmpeg for transcoding, which by default has
lame support disabled due to licensing issues. To enable mp3
audio when transcoding, you must reinstall multimedia/ffmpeg
from ports with the lame support option enabled.

To automatically start MediaBrowser at boot time:
# echo 'mediabrowser_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

To then manually start MediaBrowser without rebooting:
# service mediabrowser start

Once started, visit the following webpage to configure:
http://localhost:8096/mediabrowser
