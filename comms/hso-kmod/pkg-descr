FreeBSD driver for newer Option HSDPA USB dongles.

The driver have been tested with the following devices

  * Option GlobeSurfer iCON 7.2 (2.4.6Hd firmware)
  * Option GlobeSurfer iCON 225

Older cards should work just fine with ubsa(4) or any similar
USB-over-serial driver.

Note that this driver should be considered beta.
