This port does not contain any FreeBSD device drivers for infrared
devices. This port installs the LIRC daemons and tools for interacting
with drivers that support the LIRC device interface.

You will need to obtain third party device drivers or port the Linux
drivers in ${WRKSRC}/drivers to use the LIRC port.

Update for 0.9:  Known working with this update are FTDI-based USB
IR receivers/transmitters like described here,

	http://www.huitsing.nl/irftdi/

and if you use the recent multimedia/webcamd port then MCE USB based
ones driven by the Linux mceusb driver as well remotes coming with
USB DVB tuners that by default work with the Linux drivers used in
webcamd should also work, i.e. if webcamd creates a /dev/lircX
device node check if e.g.

	mode2 -d /dev/lirc0

reports pulses and spaces when triggering the remote at the receiver,
if it does you probably will be able to use lirc.

Some other userland drivers will probably also work (like others
using libusb), they just were not tested.

The lirc documentation should be accessible at:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/doc/lirc/html/index.html

Some example configs should have been installed here:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/examples/lirc/remotes

The port now installs an example lircd.conf that's preconfigured
for use with webcamd, either with USB DVB tuner remotes supported
by the Linux drivers by default that webcamd uses, or for remotes
supplied with MCE USB IR receivers.  If you want to create a config
for a different remote using an IR receiver that works with mode2
you can try using irrecord like described here:
