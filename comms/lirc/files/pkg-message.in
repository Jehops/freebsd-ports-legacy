This port does not contain any FreeBSD device drivers for infrared
devices. This port installs the LIRC daemons and tools for interacting
with drivers that support the LIRC device interface.

You will need to obtain third party device drivers or port the Linux
drivers in ${WRKSRC}/drivers to use the LIRC port.

Update for 0.9:  Known working with this update are FTDI-based USB
IR receivers/transmitters like described here,

	http://www.huitsing.nl/irftdi/

and if you use the recent multimedia/webcamd port then MCE USB based
ones driven by the Linux mceusb driver as well remotes coming with
USB DVB tuners that by default work with the Linux drivers used in
webcamd should also work, i.e. if webcamd creates a /dev/lircX
device node check if e.g.

	mode2 -d /dev/lirc0

reports pulses and spaces when triggering the remote at the receiver,
if it does you probably will be able to use lirc.

Some other userland drivers will probably also work (like others
using libusb), they just were not tested.

The lirc documentation should be accessible at:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/doc/lirc/html/index.html

Some example configs should have been installed here:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/examples/lirc/remotes

USB DVB tuner remotes won't be in there though because the webcamd
/dev/lircX support for those is kind of a `hack' that works
different from Linux (emulating rc5-like pulses), but as long as
mode2 sees data (meaning the Linux drivers used by webcamd support
the remote), you should be able to create configs by using irrecord
like described here:
