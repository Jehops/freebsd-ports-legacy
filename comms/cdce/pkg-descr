This port builds a driver for several devices which communicate using Ethernet
over USB (CDC Ethernet specification).  It does not yet include support for
more advanced devices such as cable modems, but is sufficient to talk to
several Linux-based PDAs.

This driver has been confirmed to work with Sharp Zaurus and YOPY handhelds.

It currently only works on FreeBSD 5.3 or later.
