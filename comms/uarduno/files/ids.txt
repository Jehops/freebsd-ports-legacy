// Arduino UNO USB Serial Port Kernel Driver for FreeBSD
//
// This is a user-modifiable file that can be used to add extra
// USB Vendor ID / Product ID combinations to the list of existing
// combinations that the driver recognizes as an Arduino Uno.
//
// If you modify your Arduino Uno (or obtain a similar unit with a different
// Vendor/Product combination) you can simply modify this file to include
// the new Vendor/Product information.
//
// Place your NEW Vendor ID / Product ID combinations below in the form of
// a C-language structure initializer entry, as follows
//
//     { 0xaaaa, 0xbbbb },
//
// Where '0xaaaa' is the vendor ID, and '0xbbbb' is the product ID that you
// want the driver to recognize as an Arduino UNO.  It must end with a ','
//
// The default value of { 0x2341, 0x0001 } is already included as a reference.
// NOTE:  do not remove or modify this entry unless you really really mean it.
//
// If you change this file, you will need to update it each
// time you obtain a fresh copy of the ports tree.
//
//

    { 0x2341, 0x0001 },  // Arduino UNO, vendor 2341H, product 0001H

// place your entries below this line
