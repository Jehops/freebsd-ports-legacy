Bayonne is a modular multithreaded telephony server that allows one to
build and deploy script driven telephony voice response applications that
are either stand-alone or integrated with other existing system services
thru perl scripts, web servers, etc.  Bayonne initially supports Quicknet
and Voicetronix hardware under FreeBSD.
