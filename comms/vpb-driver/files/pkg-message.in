IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

To load(use) the driver, run (as root):

	# kldload %%PREFIX%%/lib/vpb.ko

To unload it:

	# kldunload vpb

Alternatively you can copy the provided sample script

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/vpb.sh.sample

to

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/vpb.sh

and add

	vpb_driver_enable="YES"

to your /etc/rc.conf file.

This port is based on the original driver for FreeBSD RELENG_4 by Voicetronix.
I have updated the driver to compile as a kernel loadable module and added
the port infrastructure. Should you have issues with the above, please report
them to me. Problems related to the driver itself (vpb.c) and or the library
(libvpb.a) should also be directed to Voicetronix as the original authors
and code owners.
