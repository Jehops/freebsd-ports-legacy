* This package includes a device driver in a kernel module. While it is      *
* installed in $PREFIX/share/mwave, this results in the initial device       *
* probe not seeing the device and possibly reporting errors for the sio      *
* device which may be ignored.                                               *
*                                                                            *
* It may also result in the serial device being probed at a 8250 instead of  *
* a 16550A as the probe may occur before he device is fully initialized. If  *
* this happens you must re-boot to get the modem to work.                    *
*                                                                            *
* You can eliminate this problem by copying $PREFIX/share/mwave/mwavedd.ko   *
* into /modules. Then add the line 'mwavedd_load="YES"' to /boot/loader.conf.*
* This will load the driver at the start of the bootstrap and it will probe  *
* in a normal manner.                                                        *
