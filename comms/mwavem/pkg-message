* This package includes a device driver as a kernel module. While it is      *
* installed in $PREFIX/share/mwavem, this results in the initial device      *
* probe not seeing the device and possibly reporting errors for the sio      *
* device which may be ignored.                                               *
*                                                                            *
* You may choose to standardize the module loading by copying                *
* $PREFIX/share/mwavem/mwave.ko into /modules. Then add the line             *
* 'mwave_load="YES"' to /boot/loader.conf. This will load the driver         *
* at the start of the bootstrap and it will probe in a normal manner.        *

* If the sio device connected to the modem probe as an 8250 device, the      *
* modem will not work. Make sure that the mwavem process is running and      *
* reboot the system. It should probe correctly and the modem should be       *
* opertional.                                                                *
