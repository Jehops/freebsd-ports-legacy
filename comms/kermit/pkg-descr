KERMIT file transfer protocol 5A edit 189
-----------------------------------------

This is a release of C-Kermit 5A edit 189 file transfer protocol utility.
This version supports transfer of un-escaped control characters for
very fast file transfers with high reliability.

Note: the setgid to dialer is intentionally disabled in this port for
security reasons.  If you want a non-root user to be able to dial out,
we recommend putting the user's uid in group "dialer".
