YAWMPPP (Yet Another Window Maker PPP dockapp) is a
Window Maker dockapp that gets its inspiration from the
original WMPPP.  It has an easy-to-use GUI configuration
dialog and generates a chat script (as well as stop and
start scripts) for use with pppd.  The dockapp shows
how long you've been connected, current network traffic,
and some fairly interesting lights.
