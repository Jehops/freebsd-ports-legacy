gMFSK by Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS, is now installed!

Start it using the command "gmfsk".  You may need to type "rehash"
first.

Upon first starting it, go to Settings->Preferences and fill out
all your details.

Under Settings->Preferences->Devices->Sound set your sound device to
/dev/dspW0
This will use the 16bit sound device rather than /dev/dsp0 which is
the 8bit sound device.

Then use the Gnome-volume-control or your favourite mixer program
to set your receive and transmit levels.  DO NOT OVERDRIVE YOUR RIG.  
I recommend you head over to
http://www.w5bbr.com/
which has links to useful info.

Enjoy!
