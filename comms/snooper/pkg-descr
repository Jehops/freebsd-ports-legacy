The snooper is a serial line snooping tool used for snooping communication
between two devices that communicate with an RS232C serial line.

An typical machine configuration involving three computers is:

		partyA		a computer 
		partyB		computer/modem/digi-cam/whatever
		console		The computer you are using to snoop
				the communication between A and B.

	Say, you would like to snoop the following configuration.
		partyA ---cableAB--- partyB
	In that case you should connect "console" between partyA and
	cableAB, as follows:
		partyA ---cableX--- console ---cableAB--- party B
	cableX must be cross-cable (a cable to connect two computers).

Command-line options
