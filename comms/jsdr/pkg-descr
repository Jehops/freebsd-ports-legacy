SDR-J (formerly Jsdr) is a suite of four programs provided under a
LGPL open source license for playing around with sdr (software
defined radio). The software can be used directly with the PM-SDR
kit and RTL2832U based dongles, and in the 32 bits Windows version
with other kits as well.

The suite contains four programs:

- a full blown "short wave" receiver, which provides tuning in the
  range of 100K .. 165M using the PM-SDR (although above 55 M with
  reduced performance) and from app 55 MHz to app 900 Mhz or above
  using an RTL2832U based dongle. The receiver provides quite a number
  of decoders for amateur modes.
- am/fm receiver covering the same frequency bands as the sw receiver,
  however, with am bandwidths selectable, with fm mono and stereo
  decoding as well as with rds decoding.
- spectrum viewer for use with the RTL2832U based dongles, showing
  spectra of up to 3 Mhz bandwidth.
- mini receiver, a stripped version of the fm receiver, a gadget
  for listening to WFM using DAB sticks.
