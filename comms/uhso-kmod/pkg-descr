FreeBSD driver for newer Option HSDPA USB dongles.

The driver have been tested with the following devices

  * Option GlobeSurfer iCON 7.2 (2.4.6Hd firmware)
  * Option GlobeSurfer iCON 225
  * Option iCON 505

Older cards should work just fine with ubsa(4) or any similar
USB-over-serial driver.

Note that this driver should be considered beta and will
work with FreeBSD 8.0 (with USB2) or superior only.
Please use comms/hso-kmod for previous versions of FreeBSD.
