Xlog is an Amateur Radio station logger.  Xlog is able to do
DXCC lookups and will display country information, CQ and ITU zone,
location in latitude and longitude and distance and heading in
kilometers or miles, both for short and long path. Locator distance
and heading calculation for VHF logging is also supported.

Xlog supports cabrillo and ADIF and can import twlog and editest files.
It also has the ability to customise log fields which makes it ideal for
use in those countries that have odd logging rules such as the U.K. Also
included is the ability to log using the FCC emissions codes.

There is a new format for exporting the log called 'labels'. This will
save some fields of the log in a TAB separated file. This file can be
imported into glabels (deskutils/glabels) using the template
called qsllabels.glabels in the xlog /usr/local/share/xlog directory.
