Xlog is a basic Amateur Radio station log.  Xlog is able to do 
DXCC lookups and will display country information, CQ and ITU zone, 
location in latitude and longitude and distance and heading in 
kilometers or miles, both for short and long path. Locator distance 
and heading calculation for VHF logging is also supported.

If your rig supports data retrieval over the serial line, you 
should have a look at the Hamradio Control Libraries (hamlib) 
port, which will allow for automatic retrieval of information 
from your radio.

Xlog supports cabrillo and ADIF and can import twlog and editest files.
