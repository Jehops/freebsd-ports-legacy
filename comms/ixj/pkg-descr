This is the ixj driver for Quicknet Internet LineJack and PhoneJack
hardware, ported from Linux.
Hardware can be found at http://www.quicknet.com
Note there is a Linux page where hardware can be purchased
without the Windows drivers at a reduced rate. You can then
use these FreeBSD ixj drivers.

The driver is used by the OpenH323 applications
(ohphone, openam and possibly GnomeMeeting in a future release).

It allows a standard telephone to be plugged into a FreeBSD machine
and used for Voice over IP or Video Conferencing.
When making a call, simply lift the handset and dial.
When receiving a call, your normal telephone actually rings.

In addition the cards support G.723.1 audio compression which
means you can communicate with a wider range of H.323 applications
such as NetMeeting, when using a modem to connect to the internet.

The port was originally made by Devin Butterfield <dbutter@wireless.net>
and is now being maintained by Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
