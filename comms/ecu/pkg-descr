    ECU	(Extended Call Utility)	is a personal and research communications
    program originally written for users of SCO	UNIX V.3.2/386 and XENIX V
    on 80286 and 80386 systems.	 Support for other systems has been added
    and	further	porting	is possible with "minor" effort	to other systems
    based on or similar to UNIX System V.

    ECU	provides the classic terminal communications facility of passing
    keyboard data to a serial line and incoming	data to	the computer video
    display.  In addition, a dialing directory,	a function key mapping
    feature, and session logging are available.

    A very flexible procedure (script) language	is also	incorporated to
    automate many communications tasks.	 In addition to	augmenting
    interactive	tasks, by using	shell scripts and ECU procedures, ECU can
    perform batch-style	communications sessions	in an entirely "unattended"
    fashion.

    ECU	presents to the	host a flexible	"ANSI" terminal	type, accepting	any
    valid video	control	sequences from MS-DOS or SCO documentation as of
    late 1990.	It also	fares well, though imperfectly,	with Sun and VT-100
    in-band video control sequences.  Standards	are great: everybody should
    have one, especially if they call it "ANSI."

    The	program	supports almost	any local terminal (console) which can be
    described in a termcap database entry.  For	more information, refer	to
    "Supported Terminals."

    ECU	supports numerous file transfer	protocols: as of this writing,
    XMODEM, XMODEM/CRC,	XMODEM-1K, YMODEM/CRC Batch, ZMODEM/CRC-16,
    ZMODEM/CRC-32, Kermit and SEAlink are supported.
