The Voicetronix API allows one to write applications for the Voicetronix
4 port analog DSP telephony cards.  These cards are generally available
from Voictronix in Australia and will soon be made available for sales
in the United States.  The API provides a single user mode library for
developing telephony applications under both FreeBSD and
GNU/Linux.  Several test applications are included.
