This is the FreeBSD Ports Collection.  Please refer to the FreeBSD
Handbook on what to do with them.

The FreeBSD Handbook is available from

  file://localhost/usr/share/doc/handbook/handbook.html

(that's the version on your machine) and

  http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/handbook.html

for the latest version from FreeBSD-current.

The section "The Ports Collection" will tell you how to use the
ports/packages and "Porting Applications" describes how you can
contribute to the ports collection.
