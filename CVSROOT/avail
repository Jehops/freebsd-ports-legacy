# cvs-committers mail is sent to all members of the /etc/group group 'ncvs'
# When adding a new committer, please add them to /etc/group first, before
# modifying this file.  That way, they get the "welcome aboard" message.
#
# PLEASE TRY TO KEEP /etc/group exactly in sync with this!  -Peter
#
# Please take careful note of the ordering of the line here.  The mail
# envelope is built with the same order as the ncvs group.  Since the mail
# is delivered sequentially, people that need it most should be closer to the
# front, however it is far from complete.  Do not sort it into alphabetical
# order!
#
# Please try to keep the handbook (contrib.sgml, authors.sgml) in
# in sync with this.
