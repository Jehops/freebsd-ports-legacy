Unfortunately, Malbolge was created too well--it has defied current attempts
to use it, and, no doubt, will be even worse in the future. Therefore, the
author, in a fit of sanity, created a second language, called Dis, after
Dante's Capital City of Hell, at the center of which is Malbolge. Dis is
like Malbolge, but, instead of attempting to be the absolute worst
programming language ever, simply tries to walk the fine line between
inhumanly difficult to use and actually impossible to use.
