The NSL (The New Scripting Language) is a scripting language intended
primarily for processing text documents in various input formats and in
various languages. It is being developed as to be as light-weight as possible,
however, providing a possibility to solve a wide range of tasks. It can be
used as a stand-alone tool, as well as a CGI engine. It is not intended to be
embeddable like Tcl, but since the interpreter is very compact, it can be
attached to an application without great overhead.

The NSL should be easy to learn. Its syntax is much simplier than that of perl
or even awk and is more like Tcl or csh. It has, however, some peculiarities
in syntax, as well as in programming techniques, so it would probably require
some time to get accustomed to.

However, the NSL is not a quick-development language. Its core does not and
shall not include 'complete solutions'. Inspite of its rather high level, it
should be regarded as a toolbox by the means of which a programmer may
implement what he wants. Only such approach (IMHO) may allow to keep the
language small, efficient, easy both to learn and to use.
