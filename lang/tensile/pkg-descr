Tensile is a brand-new programming languages designed especially
for complex processing texts in SGML-like formats. Its key feature
is the notion of finite-state automata used for defining text
transformations. Tensile has been designed, too, for Web programming,
so it has inherent CGI capabilities.

Tensile is an exTENSIbLE language which means that (a) pluggable
modules are supported and (b) user-defined and predefined entities
are mostly treated in the same way.
