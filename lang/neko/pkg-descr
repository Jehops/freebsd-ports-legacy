The Neko Programming Language

Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language which can 
also be used as an embedded scripting language. It has been designed to 
provide a common runtime for several different languages. 

Neko is not only very easy to learn and use, but also has the flexibility 
of being able to extend the language with C libraries. You can even write 
generators from your own language to Neko and then use the Neko Runtime to 
compile, run, and access existing libraries.
