GNAT IMPLEMENTED FEATURES LIST
Current as of 01/26/95

Here is the list of implemented and not implemented features. A more precise
description of the GNAT system is provided in the file 'gnatinfo.txt', which
is part of the GNAT distribution.

Latest features in GNAT version 2.02
====================================

   Extension aggregates are implemented (not much tested so far)
   The Storage_Pool mechanism is in place
   Functions returning unconstrained values shouldn't leak anymore
   Enumeration representation clauses are fully implemented
   Record representation clauses are implemented (currently there is
    a restriction that all fields must be given a position and tagged
    records cannot yet be given representation clauses)
   The constrained attribute is implemented
   Conformance checking is fully implemented
   Shared variables (pragmas Shared, Atomic, Atomic_Components,
    Volatile, and Volatile_Components) are implemented
   User-defined Initialize/Adjust/Finalize is now almost complete for
    controlled types as well as for types containing controlled components.
    (aggregates involving controlled types and functions returning objects
      with controlled components may still cause trouble).
   Alignment attribute and attribute definition clause are implemented
   Pred and Succ for fixed-point types are implemented
   Discard_Names pragma is implemented
   Arrays are passed properly to convention C routines
   Pragma Inspection_Point is implemented
   Pragma Locking_Policy is implemented
   Pragma Task_Dispatching_Policy is implemented
   Pragma Memory_Size is implemented (it is ignored anyway)
   Derived types from private types are impelmented
   Floating-point attribute functions are implemented:
    Adjacent, Ceiling, Compose, Copy_Sign, Exponent, Floor, Fraction,
    Leading_Part, Machine, Model, Pred, Remainder, Rounding, Scaling, Succ,
    Truncation, Unbiased_Rounding
   Pragma Optimize is implemented (checks that GCC optimization level is
    consistent)
   Pragma Reviewable is implemented (checks that GCC debug option "-g" is set)
   Pragma Controlled is implemented (but ignored so far)
   The attributes Version and Body_Version are implemented
   Pragma Linker_Options is implemented
   Attribute Max_Size_In_Storage_Elements is implemented
   The attribute Valid is implemented
   Requeue without abort is implemented
   Delay statement on OS/2 is now working correctly.
   The attribute Bit_Order is implemented
   Range checking for modular types
   Length checks are now implemented
   Pragma Import Fortran and COBOL are implemented
   Pragma Convention is now fully implemented (for C, Fortran, COBOL),
   Pragma Convention for Fortran correctly maps multi-dimensional arrays

Status of Features

============================================================================
= All of Ada 83 is implemented EXCEPT the following unimplemented features =
============================================================================

   The following language-defined checks are not implemented:

      Discriminant Checks
      Elaboration Checks
      Range Checks on the elaboration of a subtype_indication
      Stack overflow checking

   Language-Defined Pragmas
     Pack for arrays

   Input-Output for Integer for type Long_Long_Integer.
   (only Put currently supported for Long_Long_Integer not Get)

   Delay is not yet fixed-point as required (the current temporary
   implementation uses floating-point to represent Delay).

   Tasking is currently implemented only on the following platforms
   SGI IRIX 5.2, Sun Sparc (SunOS 4.1), i386 running IBM OS/2
