   type RTS_Lock is limited private;
   --  Should be used inside the runtime system.
   --  The difference between Lock and the RTS_Lock is that the later
   --  one serves only as a semaphore so that do not check for
   --  ceiling violations.

   type Task_Body_Access is access procedure;
   --  Pointer to the task body's entry point (or possibly a wrapper
   --  declared local to the GNARL).

   type Private_Data is limited private;
   --  Any information that the GNULLI needs maintained on a per-task
   --  basis.  A component of this type is guaranteed to be included
   --  in the Ada_Task_Control_Block.

      --  Ada 95 notes: In Ada 95, this field will be transferred to the
      --  Priority field of an Entry_Calls component when an entry call
      --  is initiated. The Priority of the Entry_Calls component will not
      --  change for the duration of the call. The accepting task can
      --  use it to boost its own priority without fear of its changing in
      --  the meantime.
      --
      --  This can safely be used in the priority ordering
      --  of entry queues. Once a call is queued, its priority does not
      --  change.
      --
      --  Since an entry call cannot be made while executing
      --  a protected action, the priority of a task will never reflect a
      --  priority ceiling change at the point of an entry call.
