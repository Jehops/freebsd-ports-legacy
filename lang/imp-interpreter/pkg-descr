IMP is a monadic style implementation of the semantics of the (very simple)
language IMP, "plain" the implementation with explicit passing of state.
                                                                                
The semantics of the IMP-language is presented in the book:

  "The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages" by Glynn Winskel
  (1993, The MIT Press).
