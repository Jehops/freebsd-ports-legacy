ScriptBasic is a scripting implementation of the BASIC language. The
aim of this implementation is to provide a general and widely used
tool for the simple programmer. One of the reason behind the success
of the Microsoft operating systems is VisualBasic, which is built into
many of the applications Microsoft delivers. Why are UNIX and other
non-Microsoft operating system users prohibited to use the simplest
programming language?

ScriptBasic is a BASIC implementation, which aims not less than
becoming the most widely used scripting tool on UNIX systems. It is
portable, it is BASIC, it is a scripting tool and it is GNU LGPL.
