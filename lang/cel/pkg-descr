Cel is a computer language. In particular it is of the
prototype-based, object oriented variety.

It was meant to be high-level, small, simple, and very OO. It's
syntax is very similar to Self (which is almost like Smalltalk).
Cel was influenced primarily by the language Self. Other strong
influencers were Smalltalk, Forth, Newtonscript, Objective-C, and
Python.
