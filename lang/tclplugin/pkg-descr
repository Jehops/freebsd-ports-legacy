What is the Tcl Plug-in?

The Tcl plug-in lets you use the web in new ways. You can now create
pages that contain compelling applications based on a mature and
easy to use scripting language, Tcl and a robust user interface
toolkit, Tk.

These applications are automatically portable to all major desktop
platforms, and can be viewed with Netscape Navigator(tm), Microsoft
Internet Explorer(tm) and other browsers that support the plug-in
mechanism. Best of all, it's available today, free of charge.
