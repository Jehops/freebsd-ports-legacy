rotfl is a simple text-formatting language. It's similar in function
to TeX, HTML, nroff/groff, Postscript, etc. However, it's far less
complicated than any of those. I made is simple because I didn't want
to learn a complicated text formatting language, yet needed to format
some stuff for use on my server. If you are looking to create some
nicely formatted text without having to learn a complicated language,
then rotfl is perfect for you.
