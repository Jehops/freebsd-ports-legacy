This package contains all neccessary ANSI-C source files to build a
running Forth-environment on most UNIX machines, on DOS and on OS/2.

The Forth-system is closely modeled along the new American National
Standard for the programming language Forth. I implemented every word
of every word set mentioned in the dpANS-6 document of june 1993.
Additionally it is compatible to Forth-83.
