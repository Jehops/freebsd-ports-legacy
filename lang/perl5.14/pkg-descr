From the distribution README:

Perl is a language that combines some of the features of C, sed, awk
and shell.  See the manual page for more hype.  There are also two Nutshell
Handbooks published by O'Reilly & Assoc.  See pod/perlbook.pod
for more information.

(I Beleive from recent discussions on the lists that this port will not
work on FreeBSD 2.0, nor will it work on earlier snapshots. This (if my
memory serves me) is due to a bug in the system library (vprintf) - MarkM)
