Writing Python C/API wrappers for Fortran routines can be a very tedious task,
especially if a Fortran routine takes more than 20 arguments but only few of
them are relevant for the problems that they solve. So, I have developed a
tool that generates the C/API modules containing wrapper functions of Fortran
routines. I call this tool as F2PY - Fortran to Python Interface Generator.
It is completely written in Python language and can be called from the command
line as f2py.
