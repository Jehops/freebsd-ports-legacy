 Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all loops
 and usually makes programs run more slowly.  @samp{-funroll-all-loops}
 implies @samp{-fstrength-reduce} as well as @samp{-frerun-cse-after-loop}.
+
+@item -fmove-all-movables
+Forces all invariant computations in loops to be moved
+outside the loop.
+This option is provided primarily to improve performance
+for some Fortran code, though it might improve code written
+in other languages.
+
+@emph{Note:} When compiling programs written in Fortran,
+this option is enabled by default.
+
+Analysis of Fortran code optimization and the resulting
+optimizations triggered by this option, and the
+@samp{-freduce-all-givs} and @samp{-frerun-loop-opt}
+options as well, were
+contributed by Toon Moene (@code{toon@@moene.indiv.nluug.nl}).
+
+Please let us (@code{fortran@@gnu.ai.mit.edu})
+know how use of these options affects
+the performance of your production code.
+We're very interested in code that runs @emph{slower}
+when these options are @emph{enabled}.
+
+@item -freduce-all-givs
+Forces all general-induction variables in loops to be
+strength-reduced.
+This option is provided primarily to improve performance
+for some Fortran code, though it might improve code written
+in other languages.
+
+@emph{Note:} When compiling programs written in Fortran,

+@item -frerun-loop-opt
+Runs loop optimizations a second time.
+This option is provided primarily to improve performance
+for some Fortran code, though it might improve code written
+in other languages.

+@emph{Note:} When compiling programs written in Fortran,

 @item -fno-peephole
 Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.
