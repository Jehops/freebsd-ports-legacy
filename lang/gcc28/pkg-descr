C++ support, and in particular template support, is vastly improved over
gcc-2.7.  G++ 2.8.1 also compiles SGI's offical reference implimentation
of the STL.

Beware: This port installs new versions of "gcc", "g++", and so forth
into the "${PREFIX}/bin" directory.  Mind your PATHs if you don't want
to use this compiler by default.  However, "cc" and "c++" will not 
be hidden by this port.
