F# developed as a research programming language to provide the much
sought-after combination of type safety, succinctness, performance,
expressivity and scripting, with all the advantages of running on a
high-quality, well-supported modern runtime system.  This combination
has been so successful that the language is now being transitioned
towards a fully supported language on the .NET platform.

F# was developed as a pragmatically-oriented variant of ML that shares a
core language with OCaml.  Unlike other scripting languages it executes
at or near the speed of C# and C++, making use of the performance that
comes through strong typing.  Unlike many type-inferred,
statically-typed languages it also supports many dynamic language
techniques, such as property discovery and reflection where needed.  F#
includes extensions for working across languages and for object-oriented
programming, and it works seamlessly with other .NET programming
languages and tools.
