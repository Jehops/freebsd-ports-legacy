The GCL system contains C and Lisp source files to build a Common
Lisp sytem.  The original KCL system was written by Taiichi Yuasa
and Masami Hagiya in 1984.  The AKCL system work was begun in 1987
by William Schelter and continued through 1994.  In 1994 AKCL was
released as GCL (GNU Common Lisp) under the GNU public library
license.

NOTE: The FreeBSD port has no tcl/tk support due do the fact that gcl-2.2.2 is
designed to use tcl7.3 and tk 3.6 which are no longer supported under FreeBSD.
