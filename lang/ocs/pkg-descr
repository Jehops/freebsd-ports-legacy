The OPAL compilation system (OCS) is a set of development tools for
creating software using the algebraic programming language OPAL. The
package includes a native compiler and an interpreter. 

OPAL is mainly developed at the Technical University of Berlin since
1986 and it is used for research and evaluation of language concepts,
algorithms and programming techniques.
