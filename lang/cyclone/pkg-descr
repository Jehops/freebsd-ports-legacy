Cyclone is a programming language based on C that is safe, meaning
that it rules out programs that have buffer overflows, dangling
pointers, format string attacks, and so on. High-level, type-safe
languages, such as Java, Scheme, or ML also provide safety, but
they don't give the same control over data representations and
memory management that C does (witness the fact that the run-time
systems for these languages are usually written in C.) Furthermore,
porting legacy C code to these languages or interfacing with legacy
C libraries is a difficult and error-prone process. The goal of
Cyclone is to give programmers the same low-level control and
performance of C without sacrificing safety, and to make it easy
to port or interface with legacy C code.
