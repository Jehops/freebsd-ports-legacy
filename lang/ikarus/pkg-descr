Ikarus Scheme is a free optimizing incremental native-code compiler
for Scheme as specified in the Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme.

Ikarus Scheme is an optimizing compiler, so your Scheme code will
run fast without the need to port hot spots to C "for performance".
With an incremental compiler, you don't need a separate compilation
step to make your program run fast. The best part is that the
compiler itself is fast, capable of compiling thousands of lines
of code per second.

Finally, Ikarus Scheme is an R6RS compiler. R6RS libraries, scripts,
record types, condition system, exception handling, unicode strings,
bytevectors, hashtable, and enumerations are among the supported
features.
