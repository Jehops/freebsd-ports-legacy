LDC is a compiler for the D programming Language.  It is based on the DMD
frontend and uses LLVM as the backend.  LLVM provides a fast and modern backend
for high quality code generation.  LDC is released under a BSD license with
exceptions for the DMD frontend and code from GDC.

The development takes place mostly on x86-32 and x86-64 Linux and that is where
LDC works best.  Support for other platforms and architectures is under
development, but we are still looking for people to help test and adjust LDC
for those platforms!

LDC already compiles a lot of D code, but should still be considered beta
quality.  Take a look at the tickets to get a better impression of what still
needs to be implemented.
