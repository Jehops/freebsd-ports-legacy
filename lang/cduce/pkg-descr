CDuce is modern programming language, adapted to the manipulation of
XML documents. With a syntax inspired from ML, it comes with many
interesting features such as higher order, overloaded functions and
powerful regular expressions patterns. It also provides an embeded XML
query language, using the traditional SELECT FROM WHERE form.

This project is a spin-off of a research effort split amongst two CNRS
labs (the Languages group of ENS in Paris and the Databases group of
LRI in Orsay), and one INRIA project (the Cristal project). Please see
the CDuce team page for a list of researchers contributing to this
research effort. Some technical papers present the theoretical
foundations of the language.
