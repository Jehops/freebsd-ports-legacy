C-- is intended as a "portable assembly language" that can replace C as a
target language used by compiler writers. The goal of the Quick C-- project is
to test those ideas in an implementation. Quick C-- is intended to be a simple,
nonoptimizing compiler that supports the run-time interface. Our primary goal
is to to validate our design experimentally. A secondary, but still significant
goal is to provide a vehicle for experimenting with new techniques for building
retargetable compilers. We want the compiler to be
   1. Easy to retarget to the platform of choice
   2. Easy to specialize, say for a new calling convention
   3. Fast
