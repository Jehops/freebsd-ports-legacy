wxBasic is an Basic interpreter that is:
   - Free 
   - Open Source (LGPL) 
   - Cross-platform (currently Windows and Linux) 

wxBasic can create stand-alone executables by binding together source code
with the interpreter.

wxBasic is written primarily in C, with some C++ linking it to the wxWindows
library. wxWindows supplies the cross-platform features.
