The Mozart system provides state-of-the-art support in two areas: open
distributed computing and constraint-based inference. Mozart
implements Oz, a concurrent object-oriented language with dataflow
synchronization. Oz combines concurrent and distributed programming
with logical constraint-based inference, making it a unique choice for
developing multi-agent systems. Mozart is an ideal platform for both
general-purpose distributed applications as well as for hard problems
requiring sophisticated optimization and inferencing abilities. We
have developed applications in scheduling and time-tabling, in
placement and configuration, in natural language and knowledge
representation, multi-agent systems and sophisticated collaborative
tools.
