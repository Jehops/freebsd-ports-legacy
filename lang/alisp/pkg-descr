ArrowLISP is a purely symbolic, tail-recursive, lexically scoped
and (mostly) side-effect-free implementation of LISP. It may be
considered an implementation of pure LISP (plus DEFINE and DEFUN).

This package contains the ArrowLISP interpreter and library, the
reference manual, and some example programs.
