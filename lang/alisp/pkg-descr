ArrowLISP is a purely symbolic, properly tail-recursive, dynamically
scoped and (mostly) side-effect-free implementation of LISP. It may
be considered an implementation of pure LISP (plus DEFINE and DEFUN).

This package contains

- the ArrowLISP interpreter
- IAI, the Interactive ArrowLISP interface (TTY-based IDE)
- a library containing many frequently used LISP functions
- some example programs
