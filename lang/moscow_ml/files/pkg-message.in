Notes for the FreeBSD port
==========================

Once the port is installed, you are good to go. Be sure to note the
docs and examples installed in the standard places.

Bugs & Incompatibilities 
========================

1. Some C-libraries depending on other ports were not built. As a
consequence, the structures 

        Gdimage, Mysql and Postgres

will fail to load. 

Note that this port is build with LD_RUN_PATH=%%PREFIX%%/lib/mosml,
so you do not need set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use any of the dynlibs.

2. The Regex structure now considers the empty string an invalid
regular expression. Certain GNU regex 0.12 specific performance hacks
could not be brought to work under FreeBSD, so expect a performance
penalty relative to, say, GNU/Linux-based mosml distributions. 

Copyright
=========

The Moscow ML system is governed by three different licenses (due to
inclusion of other peoples work). For details, refer to the following
files:

        %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/mosml/copyrght.cl
        %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/mosml/copyrght.att
        %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/mosml/README

Non-profit source redistribution seems to be ok.
