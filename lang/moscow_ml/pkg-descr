This is Moscow ML, a version of Standard ML:

The current version 1.43 of Moscow ML
    * implements the Core language of Standard ML, as revised 1996
    * implements large parts of the new SML Basis Library
    * implements separate compilation and a limited version of the
      Standard ML Modules language, with signatures and structures
      but no functors
    * can produce compact stand-alone executables (a la Caml Light)
    * supports quotations and antiquotations, useful for metaprogramming
    * includes several new libraries and a new type `char'

This is a good version of the ml language if you have limited space.
If you have sufficient disk space to hold it all, the new smlnj port
is much more complete and is a better choice.
