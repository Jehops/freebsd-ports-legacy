Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
almost all crashes, and eliminates data races.  Some of its features:

  - Algebraic data types, type inference
  - Pattern matching and closures
  - Concurrency without data races
  - Guaranteed memory safety
  - Optional garbage collection
  - Zero-cost abstractions
  - Minimal runtime
  - Efficient C bindings

Rust is currently work-in-progress.  Its development is driven by Mozilla
with help of large open source community.
