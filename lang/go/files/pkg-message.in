 To build Go programs for FreeBSD, you'll want to set up your
 environment properly. The following environment variables should
 be set:

 GOOS=freebsd
 GOARCH=%%ARCH%%
 GOROOT=%%PREFIX%%/go

 Your compiler is %%GOOBJ%%g and your linker is %%GOOBJ%%l.

 For more information on programming in Go and for more
 documentation, see http://www.golang.org.
