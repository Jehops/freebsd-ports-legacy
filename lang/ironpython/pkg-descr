IronPython is a new Python implementation targeting the .NET and
Mono platforms. It is...

* Fast - IronPython-0.6 is up to 1.7x faster than Python-2.3 on the
standard pystone benchmark.  An early performance report is are
contained in this paper for PyCon 2004.

* Integrated with the Common Language Runtime - IronPython code can
easily use CLR libraries and Python classes can extend CLR classes.

* Fully dynamic - IronPython supports an interactive interpreter
and transparent on-the-fly compilation of source files just like
standard Python.

* Optionally static - IronPython also supports static compilation
of Python code to produce static executables (.exe's) that can be
run directly or static libraries (.dll's) that can be called from
other CLR languages including C#, VB, managed C++ and many more.

* Managed and verifiable - IronPython generates verifiable assemblies
with no dependencies on native libraries that can run in environments
which require verifiable managed code.
