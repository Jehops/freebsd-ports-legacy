GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, supports a number of languages.  This
port installs the C, C++, Fortran and Java front ends as gcc46, g++46,
gfortran46, and gcj46, respectively.

It can be used interchangibly with the lang/gcc46 port which tracks
weekly upstream snapshots whereas this port will be updated less
frequently, mostly in sync with upstream releases, and will move to
lang/gcc47 and later over time.
