GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, supports a number of languages.  This
port installs the C, C++, Fortran and Java front ends as gcc49, g++49,
gfortran49, and gcj49, respectively.

It can be used interchangibly with the lang/gcc49 port, which tracks
GCC 4.9 releases, and will move to lang/gcc5 and later over time.
