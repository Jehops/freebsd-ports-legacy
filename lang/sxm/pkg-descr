SXM (a.k.a. CXEMA) is a portable implementation of the Scheme
Programming language. It conforms to IEEE/ANSI standard of Scheme
and supports all features of the R5RS Report on Scheme. In addition,
SXM supports numerous features of Chez Scheme v6.0 and SRFIs 0, 6, 8,
11, and 16. SXM is derived from David Michael Betz's XScheme. Due to
the loss of compatibility with the original (object system has been
dropped) and significant amount of modifications and additions (SXM
is 4 times bigger), I decided to treat it as a separate project with
its own name.
