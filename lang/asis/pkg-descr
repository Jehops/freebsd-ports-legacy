The Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) is an interface between an
Ada environment as defined by ISO/IEC 8652 (the Ada Reference Manual) and
any tool requiring information from this environment. An Ada environment
includes valuable semantic and syntactic information. ASIS is an open and
published callable interface which gives CASE tool and application
developers access to this information. ASIS has been designed to be
independent of underlying Ada environment implementations, thus supporting
portability of software engineering tools while relieving tool developers
from having to understand the complexities of an Ada environment's
proprietary internal representation.

ASIS 95 is the ASIS interface to Ada 95 (ISO/IEC 8652:1995). 
ASIS 95 is now available as ISO/IEC 15291:1999.

The 2011 release is the latest ASIS for GNAT implementation that functions
properly with lang/gcc-aux.  The 2012 release fully builds but result with
ASIS BUGS DETECTED during use while the ASIS tools don't even build on the
2013 release.
