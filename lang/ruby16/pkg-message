====
To build a ruby related port for Ruby 1.6, define RUBY_VER=1.6 on the
make command line.  If you want to use Ruby 1.6 by default instead of
1.8, define RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 in /etc/make.conf.

Note that some of the standard libraries are provided as separate
ports since they require extra dependencies:

	databases/ruby-gdbm:	GDBM module

	lang/ruby-tcltklib:	Tcl/Tk libraries
	japanese/ruby-tcltklib:	Tcl/Tk libraries for Japanized Tcl/Tk

	x11-toolkits/ruby-tk:	Tk modules
	japanese/ruby-tk:	Tk modules for Japanized Tcl/Tk

	lang/ruby-mode.el:	Emacs lisp modules
			
Install them as occasion demands.
