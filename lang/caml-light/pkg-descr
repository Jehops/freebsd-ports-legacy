Caml is a strongly-typed functional programming language from the
ML family, close to Standard ML but slightly different.

The Caml Light system comprises the following parts: 
     - An interactive system, based on a read-eval-print loop.
     - A batch compiler and linker, `camlc'.  The compiler
       produces standalone executable programs.
     - A medium-sized standard library.
     - A tool to build libraries of frequently-used program modules. 
     - A parser generator and a lexical analyzer generator, in the
       style of lex and yacc.
     - Various programming tools: 
         - A source-level debugger with replay capabilities (``time travel''). 
         - An hypertext browser for modules. 
	 - A simple Emacs editing mode, plus the ability to run the
	 - toplevel or the debugger under Emacs.
         - Search by types on modules. 
     - Several interface libraries: 
         - Portable graphic primitives (simple line and text drawings). 
         - Interface with the Unix system calls. 
         - Arbitrary-precision rational arithmetic (extremely efficient). 
         - High-level string operations (regular expressions, ...).
