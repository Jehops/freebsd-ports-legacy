A Python extension embedding SWI-Prolog

PyProlog is a Python extension that permits direct access to an
embedded PROLOG.  The extension lends Python the efficient unification
and backtracking of PROLOG, and allows a programmer to instrument
Python classes with PROLOG code.  Callbacks from PROLOG to Python are
also supported.
