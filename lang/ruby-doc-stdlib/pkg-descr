Welcome to the Ruby Standard Library Documentation collection,
brought to you by the ruby-doc project.
Whether you are browsing online or offline,
we hope that your use of Ruby's standard library will become more productive
as a result of this effort.

ruby-doc is a project dedicated to creating and collecting
documentation on Ruby.
You can find collections of articles and other resources at the website.

stdlib-doc is a RubyForge project that converts Ruby source code into this
documentation you are looking at.
It also tracks the status of the documentation effort.
