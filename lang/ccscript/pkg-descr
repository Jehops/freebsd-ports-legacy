ccscript offers a class extensible threaded script interpreter that may
be embedded in Common C++ derived packages as a native extension language.
This script interpreter differs from traditional scripting systems in that
it is used to script near real-time state-event transitions thru
deterministic callback step execution rather than the linear and
non-deterministic fashion of traditional extension languages such as tcl,
libguile, etc.
