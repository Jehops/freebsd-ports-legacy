GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection includes C, C++, Java and Fortran.

This port installs the various front ends as gcc45, g++45, gcj45,
gfortran45 and so forth into the ${PREFIX}/bin directory.

(Building the Java frontend and the associated libgcj library will
consume more than 512MB of main memory.  Set WITHOUT_JAVA=yes in 
the environment when building this port to avoid that.)
