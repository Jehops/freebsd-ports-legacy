This is a port of Bigloo, a Scheme system which includes a compiler
generating C code and Java classes and an interpreter. Bigloo is the
tool of choice for the construction of small autonomous applications
in Scheme. Bigloo is mostly conformant to the Revised5 Report on the
Algorithmic Language Scheme with many extensions:
        Rgc, a lex facility.
        Match, a pattern-matching compiler.
        Foreign languages interface (connection to C and to Java).
        Module language.
        Extension package system.
        An Lalr facility.
        An Object system.
        A thread library.
        DSSSL support.
        Unicode characters and strings.
        Process, Pipe and Socket support.
