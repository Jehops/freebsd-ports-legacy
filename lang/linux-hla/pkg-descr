This is the port of Randall Hyde's High Level Assembly (HLA).
Don't let the name fool you. HLA is "real" assembly language,
just made easier for beginners so they can learn the language
faster than ever before. Anything you can do with a traditional
assembler can be done with HLA; HLA just happens to do a lot
more than traditional assemblers!
