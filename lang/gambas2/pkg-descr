Gambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter with
object extensions, a bit like Visual Basic (but it is NOT a clone !).

With Gambas, you can quickly design your program GUI with QT or GTK+, access
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, ODBC and SQLite databases, pilot KDE applications
with DCOP, translate your program into any language, create network applications
easily, make 3D OpenGL applications, make CGI web applications, and so on.
