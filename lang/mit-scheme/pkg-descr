FreeBSD port of MIT Scheme-7.3

This port has been put together out of the scheme runtime binaries
out of the linux.tar.gz distribution.  These binaries are identical
for any i386 running an operating system with a unix-like filesystem.
For this reason, a makefile for building the runtime, compiler, and
edwin binaries has not been included.  One patch is neccesary to 
build the runtime binaries due to a problem with one of the system math 
libraries (mail me if you want it).  Otherwise, this patch was not
included because building the entire system takes a VERY LONG TIME,
about as long as a 'make world' in /usr/src (no one said scheme was
fast).  

The distfile was put together from the linux distribution and the
microcode sources.  This was to avoid using the official MIT 
distfiles and having to download the linux compiled binaries
(the scheme and bchscheme binaries, statically linked, 2M each).  

To use the official distfiles, you must obtain the linux.tar.gz and
the src-microcode.tar.gz from ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/scheme-7.3.
Unpack linux.tar.gz, and remove dist-7.3/bin/*.  Unpack src-microcode.tar.gz
and apply the patches from the port, now you can build the microcode.
