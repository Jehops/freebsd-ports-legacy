Always thought JavaScript was for web only? well, think again...

JavaScript.pm gives you the power of embedded JavaScript in your
applications. You can write your subs, classes etc in perl and bind them
to the JavaScript engine. Variables are converted between the language
automaticlly and you don't have to worry about that.
