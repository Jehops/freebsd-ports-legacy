This package contains all neccessary ANSI-C source files to build a
running Forth-environment on most UNIX machines, on DOS and on OS/2.

The Forth-system is closely modeled along the new American National
Standard for the programming language Forth. Every word of every 
word set mentioned in the dpANS-6 document of June 1993 has been
implemented.  Additionally it is compatible to Forth-83.

This is a new development version of pfe 0.29.1 under a new
developer.
