====
To use ruby-mode, inf-ruby and rubydb in Emacs/XEmacs, add the
following lines to your ~/.emacs:

;; Taken from the comment section in inf-ruby.el
(setq ruby-program-name "/usr/local/bin/ruby")
(autoload 'ruby-mode "ruby-mode" "Mode for editing ruby source files")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rb$" . ruby-mode))
(add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("ruby" . ruby-mode))
(autoload 'run-ruby "inf-ruby" "Run an inferior Ruby process")
(autoload 'inf-ruby-keys "inf-ruby" "Set local key defs for inf-ruby in ruby-mode")
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook '(lambda () (inf-ruby-keys)))
====
Note that some stuff that comes with the standard Ruby 1.4
distribution is provided as separate ports:

	databases/ruby14-gdbm:	GDBM module
	lang/ruby14-irb:	Interactive Ruby
	lang/ruby14-tcltklib or japanese/ruby14-tcltklib:
				Tcl/Tk libraries
	x11-toolkits/ruby14-tk or japanese/ruby14-tk:
				Tk modules

Please install them as occasion demands.
===
To use other ruby-* ports with Ruby 1.4, build and install them with
"RUBY_VER=1.4" defined. (i.e. make RUBY_VER=1.4 install)
