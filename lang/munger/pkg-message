*    To use the FastCGI interface with Apache one must also      *
*    install and configfure mod_fastcgi from                     *
*    ${PORTSDIR}/www/mod_fastcgi                                 *
*                                                                *
*    Note that mod_fastcgi 2.4.2 DOES NOT work with Apache-2.2   *
*    IT DOES work with apache 2.0                                *
*                                                                *
*    Note that you cannot use Munger to write FastCGI scripts    *
*    for webservers that do not act, or have a module which      *
*    acts as the FastCGI server.  Munger is only linked against  *
*    the client library.                                         *
*                                                                *
