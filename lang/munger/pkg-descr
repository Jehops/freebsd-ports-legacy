Munger is a simplified, statically-scoped, interpreted lisp specialized
for writing text processors for 8-bit text.  With Munger the programmer may
write text-processing filters if serial access to the text is sufficient,
or the programmer may load text into buffers and have line-oriented random
access to those lines, if that is more convenient.  Buffer lines can be
inserted, removed, overwritten, retrieved in whole or in part, with or
without tabs expanded, searched for matches on regular expressions, read
from and written to files, and piped to and from, or filtered through
external processes.
