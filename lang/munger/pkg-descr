Munger is a simple, statically-scoped, interpreted lisp that has
line-editor-like access to multiple text buffers.  Lines can be inserted,
removed, overwritten, retrieved in whole or in part, with or without tabs
expanded, searched for matches on regular expressions, read from and written
to files, and piped to and from, or filtered through external processes.

Using regular expressions to search through or transform strings is easy in
Munger.  Basic facilities for doing line-oriented I/O and cursor-addressing
are provided.  Munger also has interfaces to the FastCGI devkit
(http://www.fastcgi.com), and the SQLite library (http://www.sqlite.org).
