This is a port of the GNU debugger with Modula-3 support for
FreeBSD.  Using it you can

 o step through your Modula-3 programs in source format
 o set/clear/enable/disable breakpoints in Modula-3 programs
 o inspect the values of variables and evaluate Modula-3 expressions
 o view and inspect stack frames
 o switch between threads, if you're careful to switch back again

This debugger is much more useful if your Modula-3 libraries contain
debugging symbols.  To accomplish that, do a "make configure" of the
modula-3-lib port.  Then edit its "work/m3/m3build/templates/FreeBSD2"
file.  Search for "-g" and follow the instructions there.  Then finish
building and installing the modula-3-lib port with "make install".
