from introduction/about.txt:

  Eiffel is a systematic approach to the construction of quality software,
  including a language, a method, libraries, and development environments. 

  The language was designed in 1985 by Bertrand Meyer of ISE. The current
  language version is Eiffel 3, described in detail in Meyer's book "Eiffel:
  The Language" (Prentice Hall, 1992). Many other books are available on the
  language and the method. The language is non-proprietary. 

More docs are in ``${PREFIX}/eiffel/doc'' and ``${PREFIX}/eiffel/introduction''
Some examples are in ``${PREFIX}/eiffel/examples''.
