This is the compiler and minimal libraries from the Polytechnique
Montreal Modula-3 distribution.  PM3 is the most actively maintained
Modula-3 distribution.  It is derived from the original SRC release,
but it contains many bug fixes and enhancments.  Here are the packages
included:

digraph         m3core          m3quake         realgeometry    sgmlstructure
libm3           m3doc           m3ship          set             sgmltom3
m3build         m3driver        m3templates     sgml            sgmltools
m3bundle        m3front         m3tosgml        sgmlconv        table-list
m3coco          m3linker        mtex            sgmllinear      tempfiles
m3config        m3middle        parseparams     sgmlnormalize

Please read "${PREFIX}/share/pm3/COPYRIGHT" for the DEC copyright
notice.

Warning: Even though I have recompressed them with bzip2, the
distfiles for this port still total about 20 MB in size!
