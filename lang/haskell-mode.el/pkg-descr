An Emacs lisp mode for editing haskell programs which is very basic,
but provides a base on which to build modules.  The currently
supported modules are:

    * Font Locking: Colours keywords, comments, strings, etc.
    * Declaration Scanning: Scans declarations and places them in a
      menu.
    * Documentation: Echoes types of functions or syntax of keywords
      when the cursor is idle.
    * Indentation: Provides semi-automatic intelligent indentation.
    * Simple Indentation: Provides simple indentation.
    * Hugs Interaction: Allows interaction with the Hugs interpreter.
    * GHCi Interaction: Allows interaction with the GHCi interpreter.

Note that if you want to use haskell-mode under XEmacs, you should
install editors/xemacs-packages instead.
