To use haskell-mode in Emacs, add the following lines to your ~/.emacs:

(load "%%PREFIX%%/share/emacs/site-lisp/haskell-mode/haskell-site-file")

Add the following lines according to which modules you want to use:

(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-decl-scan)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-doc-mode)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indentation)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indent)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-simple-indent)
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

Note that the three indentation modules are mutually exclusive - add at
most one.
