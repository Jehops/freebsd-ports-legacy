Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for
researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale
numerical and graphic applications.  Lush is designed to be used in
situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a
high-level, loosely-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency
of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy
integration of code written in C, C++, or other languages.
