This module provides the capability to parse a string at runtime as
Perl source code, so that the resulting compiled code can be later
executed. This is part of the job of the string form of the eval
operator, but in this module it is separated out from the other jobs
of eval. Parsing of Perl code is generally influenced by its lexical
context, and this module provides some explicit control over this
process, by reifying lexical environments as Perl objects.
