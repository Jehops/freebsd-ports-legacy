Scheme->C is an implementation of the language Scheme as described
in the Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (Lisp
Pointers, Volume Iv, Number 3, July-September 1991).  

This implementation has certain extensions to the language which
allows Scheme to be compiled to C into standalone programs, combined
with other languages, or compiled into the interpreter itself.

Scheme->C also includes an X interface library.  

This port includes shared libs.
