REXX/imc is a Rexx interpreter for Unix. It supports all the standard 
instructions and built-in functions, plus a small number of extensions, 
and has a partial implementation of the SAA API allowing applications 
to call Rexx programs and to register addressing environments, Rexx 
functions, and exit handlers.
