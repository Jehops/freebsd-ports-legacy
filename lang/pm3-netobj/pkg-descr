This is the network objects package from the Polytechnique Montreal
Modula-3 (PM3) distribution.  Network objects offer transparent remote
method invocation on objects. Network objects are simpler to use than
remote procedure calls because objects store the remote connection
information, and the runtime automatically handles the external data
representation used to exchange parameters during remote calls.

This port includes these PM3 packages:
