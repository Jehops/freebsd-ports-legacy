Intel2gas is a small text parser that can convert assembler source
written in Intel (nasm) syntax to AT&T (gas) syntax.  And nowadays
more often also the other way.

The program does minimal error checking and does not understand the
text it's converting.  It just tries to find matches from its syntax
database.
