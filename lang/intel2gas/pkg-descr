intel2gas 1.2 (c)1999 Mikko Tiihonen (mikko.tiihonen@hut.fi)

This program converts assembler source from intel (NASM), to AT&T (gas) 
syntax. It is FREE SOFTWARE under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License (GPL), enclosed in the file 'COPYING'.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel2gas is a small text parser that can convert assembler source
written in intel syntax to at&t syntax. And nowadays more often also
the other way.

The program does minimal error checking and does not understand the
text it's converting. It just tries to find matches from its syntax
database.
You are encouraged to send any bug reports, suggestions and comments to
