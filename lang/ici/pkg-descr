ICI is a C-like, high level language originally developed by Tim Long
and placed into the public domain. ICI marries C's expression syntax,
control structures and overall feel, with a dynamic, garbage
collected, object-based, data model. Version introduces a cleaner
class system for OO programming and refines the language.

ICI is typically used as a scripting-like language in the fashion of
Perl, Python, TCL and other such languages.  ICI can be called from C
and the language itself can be extended allowing applications to
provide domain specific functions, types and operators for use in
their ICI programs. Embedding in an application also allows the
application to make use of ICI's efficient object system which
provides many useful facilities.

ICI is in the public domain, there is no copyright on it.
