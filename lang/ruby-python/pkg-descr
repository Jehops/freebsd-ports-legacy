Ruby extension library for embedding Python in Ruby.  With this
library, Ruby scripts can directly call arbitrary Python modules.
Both extension modules and modules written in Python can be used.

Ruby and Python have some differences as described here.  This library
enables Ruby users to have the advantages of both languages:

  - Straightforward and easy-to-learn OO functionality of Ruby.
  - Plenty of modules written for Python.

If you are attracted by Python modules but not fully satisfied with
Python's syntax or type system, try this library!
