FPL is a complete script programming language _very_ similar to C. If
you are a software developer and plans to add any kind of macro/script
control, consider the FPL alternative!

FPL library lets the software programmer define functions and variables
that FPL should accept. The library will call a function in the software
whenever any of these functions are used or variables are read in an FPL
program.
