    4. Threads.  If configured with the --enable-threads flag, Tcl can
    now be compiled for use in a multi-threaded application.
    Individual threads are allowed to use one or more interpreters as
    long as each interpreter (and any slave interpreters) is only
    accessed by one thread.  Each thread runs its own event loop, and
    you can post events to other threads. There are new C APIs for
    mutexes, condition variables, and thread local storage.  See the
    doc/Thread.3 manual entry for more details.  Tk 8.1 is not yet
    multi-thread safe.  There is not yet support for tcl level use of
    threading except for a test command. (Compile tcltest and try
    testthread.)
