Aleph is a multi-threaded functional programming language with dynamic
symbol bindings that support the object oriented paradigm. Aleph features
a state of the art runtime engine that supports both 32 and 64 bits
platforms. Aleph comes with a rich set of libraries that are designed to
be platform independent.

The Aleph engine is written in C++ and provides runtime compatibility with
it. Such compatibility includes the ability to instantiate C++ classes,
use virtual methods and raise or catch exceptions. A comprehensive API has
been designed to ease the integration of foreign libraries.
