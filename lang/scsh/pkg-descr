Scsh is a Unix shell in that is has significant syntax extensions to
make writing Unix shell scripts easy (constructing pipelines, setting
I/O redirection, conditional execution etc.). It also offers access to
lower-level functionality like all Posix system calls, TCP/IP sockets
and a full-featured regular expression library. This is embedded into
a general-purpose programming language with real data types,
extensive, syntactically clean control constructs and "real" quoting
rules.

Scsh is also a full implementation of R4RS Scheme with some
non-standard behavior (required for scripting). As a result, a wide
varity of exiting Scheme code can be used. The underlying Scheme
implementation is a virtual machine for compact byte code.

The name of the installed program is "scsh", the manpage is scsh(1),
other documentation is in (/usr/local/)lib/scsh/doc. To load slib,
install slib into /usr/local/lib/slib and run (load "slib-init.scm")
in scsh. It requires no additional setup (paths or such). The emacs
interface is in the original distribution in emacs/. For documentation
see doc/user-guide.txt.
