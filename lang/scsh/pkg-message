Differences between FreeBSD port and generic scsh release:
----------------------------------------------------------

1) When hitting C-d (end-of-file), scsh asks 100 times for
confirmation. I changed the default to do this just once. Set constant
*y-or-n-eof-count* in scsh/rw.scm to change it.

2) The original scsh sends a mail to the scsh authors every time you
make the package. The FreeBSD port/package doesn't. The authors of scsh
would appreciate it if you do a `(cd work/scsh-0.4.4 && make .notify)`
after you build the port.  If you installed a binary package, this is
not possible.

3) A symbolic link ${PREFIX}/share/doc/scsh to the documentation is
created.

4) Some basic description text files from the distribution base dir
are copied to lib/doc. The emacs directory is copied into
lib/scsh/emacs. scsh's default is not to install these files.

5) The port uses /var/tmp instead of /usr/tmp where possible.
