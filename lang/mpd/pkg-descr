MPD is a new programming language that has a syntax very close to the
one used in the book Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and
Distributed Programming. The name of the language comes from the first
three letters of the main words of the title of the book:
Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed. These words also capture a
distinguishing aspect of the language, namely that it supports all
three of these concurrent programming techniques.

MPD is implemented as a variant of the SR programming language. It has
a different parser, but it uses the same intermediate form and
run-time system as SR. Consequently, MPD provides the same variety of
concurrent programming mechanisms as does SR.
