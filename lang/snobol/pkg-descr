This is GNU Awk 3.0.4. It should be upwardly compatible with the Bell
Labs research version of awk.  It is almost completely compliant with
the 1993 POSIX 1003.2 standard for awk. (See the note below about POSIX.)

Patches 1 through 4 just fix bugs -- see NEWS and ChangeLog for details.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Known problems are given in the PROBLEMS file.  Work to be done is
described briefly in the FUTURES file.  Verified ports are listed in
the PORTS file.  Changes in this version are summarized in the NEWS file.
Please read the LIMITATIONS and ACKNOWLEDGMENT files.

Read the file POSIX for a discussion of how the standard says comparisons
should be done vs. how they really should be done and how gawk does them.
  
To format the documentation with TeX, use at least version 2.151 of
texinfo.tex. There is a usable copy of texinfo.tex in the doc directory.

The Info file now comes with the distribution.

The man page is up to date.
