This is a port of OGI's new release of Hugs, a Haskell interpreter and
programming environment for developing Haskell programs.

This release is largely conformant with Haskell 98, including monad
and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and modules.  In
addition, it comes packaged with almost all libraries defined in the
most recent version of the Haskell 98 Library Report.
