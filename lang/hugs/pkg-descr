This is a port of Nottingham's and Yale's new release of Hugs,
a Haskell interpreter and programming environment for developing
Haskell programs.

This release is largely conformant with Haskell 1.4, including
monad and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and
modules.  In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined
in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report.

Available documentation includes HTML versions of the "Hugs Users
Manual", the "Haskell 1.4 Report", the "Haskell Library Report" as
well as a "Gentle Introduction to Haskell".  More online information
is available from http://www.haskell.org.
