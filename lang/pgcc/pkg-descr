		The Pentium Compiler GROUP

Mail me at marc@cerebro.inka.de for anything concerning this FAQ. 

                     What is the Pentium GCC Workgroup for?

The PCG was created because all the patched GCC's are somewhat unstable 
(i.e. they cannot compile some programs) and somewhat insecure (they 
sometimes generate wrong code, although this goes unnoticed in many cases!). 

The PWG wants to 

	o improve the stability of the compiler 
	o enhance the quality of the generated code (better optimizations) 
	o get cygnus and/or gnu to include some optimizations in the 
	  "official" GNU cc
