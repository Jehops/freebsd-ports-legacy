T3X is a minimum procedural language. It is small, portable,
procedural, block-structured, recursive, almost typeless,
and to some degree object-oriented.
Its syntax is a cross between Pascal and BCPL, but it is smaller
and simpler. Portability is achieved by simplicity: only a set
of very basic operations and built-in routines is provided, which
may be easily implemented on a variety of different platforms.

This package contains ...

. a bytecode compiler and optimizers
. a Tcode interpreter
. 386 and 8086 (EXE) backends
. runtime support for FreeBSD, Linux, DOS, Coherent, etc.
. a Tcode disassembler
. misc. tools
. documentation in HTML (/usr/local/t3x/r7/doc/T3X.html)
