T3X is a very basic procedural language. Its syntax is a cross
between Pascal and BCPL, but it is smaller and simpler.
Unlike many popular languages, T3X does not provide a very
abstract and complex environment to achieve portability, but
only a set of very basic operations and built-in routines which
may be easily implemented on a variety of different platforms.

This package contains ...

. a bytecode compiler and optimizer
. a Tcode interpreter
. FreeBSD(a.out,ELF) and DOS(EXE) native code backends
. a Tcode disassembler
. run time libraries
. misc. tools
. documentation in HTML (/usr/local/t3x/r6/doc/T3X.html)
. an online help system in structured document format
