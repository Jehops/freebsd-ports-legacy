T3X is a minimum procedural language. It is small, portable,
procedural, block-structured, recursive, almost typeless,
and to some degree object-oriented.
Its syntax is a cross between Pascal and BCPL, but it is smaller
and simpler. Portability is achieved by simplicity: only a basic
set of operations and runtime classes is provided, which may be
easily implemented on a variety of different platforms.

This package contains ...

- a bytecode compiler and optimizers
- a Tcode interpreter
- 386, 8086 (EXE), and Alpha AXP backends
- A DOS/EXE generator for all platforms
- runtime support for FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, DOS, Coherent
- a Tcode examination utility
- tools (pretty-printer, make utility, class manager)
- the T3X user manual in HTML format
- an online help system in structured document format
