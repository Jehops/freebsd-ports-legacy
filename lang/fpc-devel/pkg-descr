FPC, Free Pascal Compiler, is a 32-bits Delphi and TP commandline compiler,
which is available for most x86 OSes, and a few m68k versions.

The new series (1.9.x which are beta's for 2.0) also allow compilation to
powerpc (Linux, Netbsd, Darwin), while Sparc, Arm and x86-64 are in
preparation, and has a near complete set of Delphi's language. This is the
x86 version only.

There are three important things to keep in mind.
- the port honours NOPORTDOCS with respect to the PDF's and the installation of 
  the source. I urgently advise you to install the source though.
  (and delete the docs if you really don't need them). 
- Some localisation can be selected in fpc.cfg, by adding/editing the line
	-Fr$PREFIX/lib/fpc/$VERSION/error<langcode>.msg
- The port has no mandatory dependancies, but installs a lot precompiled
  headers and wrappers for all kinds of packages, including db and widget sets
