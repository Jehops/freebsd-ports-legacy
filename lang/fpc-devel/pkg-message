This port installed its configuration in either /etc/fpc.cfg.sample (if your prefix
is /usr) or  ~/.fpc.cfg.sample (otherwise), this because FPC doesn't search prefix/etc yet.

Rename the .sample file to fpc.cfg or .fpc.cfg respectively, and check that the
prefix of the last three lines match your prefix.

For global usage, /etc is the only serious location at the moment.
