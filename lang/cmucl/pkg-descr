CMUCL is the CMU implementation of Common Lisp. This is a 18a
prerelease, probably the most stable version to get for FreeBSD. For
further information see http://www.cons.org/cmucl/

First-aid documentation is in the manpages lisp(1) and cmucl(1) and
via the normal Common Lisp documentation runtime functions (describe
...)  (documentation ...)  and (apropos ...). There is a real user
manual that is currently adopted to 18a. See the homepage for
pointers, we have GNU info, postscript and initial HTML files.

CMUCL's strength in comparison with other Lisp systems (or dynamic
languages in general) is its highly optimizing compiler. If you know
how to write efficient Common Lisp code, you are free of unwanted
memory allocation, type checks, indirections to objects. And CMUCL
helps you to write efficient Common Lisp, it generates very
informative warning messages about code constructs that prevent
compilation to efficient code.

Optional packages for graphical user interfaces and other Common Lisp
applications and libraries are are on
