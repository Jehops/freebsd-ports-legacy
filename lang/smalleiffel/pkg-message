SmallEiffel is now available through the symbolic link %%PREFIX%%/SmallEiffel.

Add %%PREFIX%%/SmallEiffel/bin to your path to be able to call 
the SmallEiffel compiler and its other utilities.

Make sure the environment variable SmallEiffel is defined and points to
%%PREFIX%%/SmallEiffel/sys/system.se.

One way to do this is to extend /etc/profile with the following line:

  SmallEiffel=%%PREFIX%%/SmallEiffel/sys/system.se; export SmallEiffel
