SketchyLISP is a small, tail-recursive, lexically scoped interpreter for
purely symbolic dialect of LISP that smells like Scheme. It may be considered
an implementation of pure LISP plus DEFINE and CALL/CC.

This package contains the SketchyLISP interpreter and library, the reference
manual, and example programs.
