Sketchy is an interpreter for a purely applicative dialect of
Scheme. It may be considered an implementation of pure LISP
plus global definitions (DEFINE), first-class continuations
(CALL/CC) and input/output functions (READ, WRITE, etc).

This package contains the Sketchy interpreter and library, the
manual, and example programs.
