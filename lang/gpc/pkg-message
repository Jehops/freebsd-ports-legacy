The GNU Pascal Compiler has been installed.

In order to use some units you need additional libraries:

CRT	devel/ncurses (in the base system) or devel/pdcurses (for X11)
GMP	math/libgmp4
GRAPH	graphics/grx
GRX	graphics/grx
INTL	devel/libintl
REGEX	devel/rx

The documentation also recommends ElectricFence (devel/ElectricFence) to be a
useful library (not GPC unit) for debugging memory allocation bugs.
