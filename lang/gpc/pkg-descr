GNU Pascal is part of the GNU compiler family, GNU CC or GCC.
It combines a Pascal front-end with the proven GNU C back-end
for code generation and optimization.  Unlike utilities such
as p2c, this is a true compiler, not just a converter.
			
The current release 2.0 implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185,
level 1), a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206), and
Borland Pascal.
