Gambas  is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter
with object extensions, like Visual Basic(TM) (but it is NOT  a clone !).

With Gambas, you can quickly design your program GUI, access MySQL or
PostgreSQL databases, pilot KDE applications with DCOP, translate your
program into many languages, create network applications easily, and so on.
