wamcc is a Prolog Compiler which translates Prolog to C via the WAM
(Warren Abstract Machine).  wamcc has a syntax which conforms to the
proposed ISO standard.

wamcc offers the most usual built-in predicates, a top-level, a Prolog
debugger and a WAM debugger, dynamic and compiled code, modules, 
global variables, global arrays...).  wamcc is designed to be easily
extended (e.g. clp(FD) is a constraint logic language over Finite
Domains designed on wamcc). 

wamcc tries to be conform to the (future) ISO standard Prolog.
The draft ISO standard for Prolog is available by anonymous ftp from
ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog.standard/ [128.192.12.9]. An unofficial summary
of the draft ISO Prolog standard is available from the same location
as isoprolog.tex or isoprolog.ps.Z.

The directory /usr/local/share/doc/wamcc contains a user's manual as
a LaTeX file.  Examples are installed in /usr/local/share/examples/wamcc.
