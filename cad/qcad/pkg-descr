What Is QCad?

   QCad is a professional CAD System. With QCad you can easily construct
   and change drawings with ISO-texts and many other features and save
   them as DXF-files. These DXF-files are the interface to many
   CAD-systems such as AutoCAD® and many others.

What is QCad not?

   QCad is no designer tool. That means you can not create any filled
   shapes nor any crazy freehand forms. Also you can not drag and drop
   the objects in the drawing with the mouse. If you're searching for
   such a tool you may take a look at KIllustrator (part of KOffice) or
   CorelDraw® from Corel, which comes out in the beginning of the year
   2000 for Linux.
