Cascade is a novel solution to this problem, the world's first just-in-time
compiler for Verilog. Cascade executes code immediately in a software simulator,
and performs compilation in the background. When compilation is finished,
the code is moved into hardware, and from the user's perspective it simply
getsfaster over time. Cascade's ability to move code back and forth between
software and hardware also makes it the first platform to provide generic
support for the execution of unsynthesizable Verilog from hardware.
