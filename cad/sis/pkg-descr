sis is an interactive program for the synthesis of both synchronous
and asynchronous sequential circuits.  The input can be given in state
table format or as logical equations (for synchronous circuits), or
as a signal transition graph (for asynchronous circuits); a target
technology library is given in genlib format.  The output is a netlist
of gates in the target technology.

The system includes various capabilities that are controlled interactively
by the user.  These include state minimization, state assignment,
optimization for area and delay using retiming, optimization using
standard algebraic and Boolean combinational techniques from MISII,
performance optimization using restructuring, and technology mapping
for optimal area and delay.  Redundancy removal and 100% testability
are provided for combinational and scan-path circuits.  Formal verification
is available for both combinational and sequential circuits, even for
circuits with different state encodings.

This distribution contains sis, nova (state assignment), jedi (state
assignment), stamina (state minimization, from June Rho at University of
Colorado, Boulder), sred (state minimization), espresso, blif2vst (mapped
BLIF to structural VHDL translator), vst2blif (structural VHDL to BLIF
translator), xsis (a front-end graphical interface to sis) and several stripped
down packages from the OctTools (options, port, and utility) that are needed
for some of the programs listed above.
