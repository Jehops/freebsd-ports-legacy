Elmer - Open Source Finite Element Software for Multiphysical Problems.

Elmer is an open source multiphysical simulation software mainly
developed by CSC - IT Center for Science (CSC). Elmer development was
started 1995 in collaboration with Finnish Universities, research institutes
and industry. After it's open source publication in 2005, the use and
development of Elmer has become international.

Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics,
electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are
described by partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the
Finite Element Method (FEM).

Note: This package installs in it's own ELMER_HOME path, so you usually
have to add /usr/local/elmer/bin/ to your shell path.
