gEDA stands for GNU Electronic Design Automation (EDA). It is a
collection of tools for doing schematic capture, circuit simulation,
printed circuit board layout and any other tasks involving electronic
circuits. Basically all the tools which are part of gEDA are used to
automate the design process of electronic circuits. Both analog
and digital designers use EDA tools to simplify the design process.
What makes gEDA unique when compared to commercial tools is that
all the of the source and file specifications are placed under the
GNU Public License (GPL) version 2.0. These leads to a open (as
in the no secrets and no surprises type of "open"), flexible,
extensible, and readily available toolset for doing EDA.
