GiD has been designed as a universal, adaptive and user-friendly graphical 
user interface for geometrical modelling, data input and visualisation of 
results for all types of numerical simulation programs. Typical problems 
that can be successfully tackled with GiD include most situations in solid 
and structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, heat transfer, 
geomechanics, etc. using finite element, finite volume, boundary element, 
finite difference or point based (meshless) numerical procedures.

GiD is ideal to be used in a multi-user environment in universities, 
research centers and enterprises for development and applications of 
different numerical simulation programs

Note: The Academic version is free to download and use and can be upgraded 
to a professional version by buying a license.
