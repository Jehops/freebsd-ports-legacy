=================================

Copyright (C) 2001-2004 Sarod Yatawatta

PdnMesh is  a 2D mesh generator and Finite Element program, 
especially designed to solve  field problems. 
It is written in C and uses OpenGL/Mesa
and GTK/GTKGLExt for visualization. It can import  DXF 
files created by CAD programs and convert them as input to
be used in the program itself. 

Apart from producing graphical output, pdnmesh can 
produce encapsulated postscript files of the solution.
