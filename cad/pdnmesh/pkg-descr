pdnMesh: A finite element program
=================================

Copyright (c) 2001 Sarod Yatawatta

PdnMesh is  a 2D finite element program, especially designed to solve
electromagnetic, fluid dynamic and heatflow problems. It is written in C and
uses OpenGL/Mesa and glut for visualization. There is also a script written
in perl called 'd2m' that can be used to convert DXF files to ones suitable
for this program.

Apart from producing graphical output, pdnmesh can be run in text mode to
produce encapsulated postscript files of the solution.
