This port provides a GUI for two freely available SPICE electronic circuit
simulation engines: GNU-Cap and Ng-Spice.

Current features:
	Import gschem schematic files using gentlist. 
	Load and parse circuit description (net list) files. 
	Provides a GUI interface for GNU-Cap OP, DC, AC and Transient
		analyses and generates appropriate simulator commands
		based on user input. 
	Provides a GUI interface for Ng-Spice DC, AC and Transient
		analyses and generates appropriate simulator commands
		based on user input. 
	The raw output may be viewed for any processes initiated by gspiceui. 
	Formatting of simulator output so that it may be plotted using gwave.
