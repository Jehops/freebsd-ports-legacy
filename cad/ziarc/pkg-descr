ZiaRC (which is a recursive acronym for "ZiaRC is a Resistor Calculator")
facilitates the drawing of resistor nets and calculates overall resistivity
and particular currents through the resistors. It consists of a graphical
user interface which allows the easy creation of resistor nets and has many
functions such as undo/redo, delete, move and many more.
