CIDER is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator.
CIDER attempts to provide greater simulation accuracy than a stand-alone
circuit or device simulator can provide.
CIDER is based on the sequential mixed-level circuit and
device simulator, CODECS.  In common with CODECS, CIDER embeds the circuit
simulator, SPICE3, which provides circuit simulation capabilities,
analytical models for semiconductor devices, and an interactive
user interface.  An interface to the captive device simulator, DSIM,
provides accurate, one- and two-dimensional numerical models
based on the solution of Poisson's equation, and the electron and hole
current-continuity equations.  The input format of CIDER couples
SPICE-like circuit descriptions
to a device description format similar to the one
used by the PISCES device simulator developed at Stanford University.
As a result, CIDER should seem reasonably familiar to designers
already accustomed to both these tools.

SPICE is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear DC,
nonlinear transient, and linear AC analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current
sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission
lines (two separate implementations), switches, uniform distributed RC
lines, and the five most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs,
MESFETs, and MOSFETs.
