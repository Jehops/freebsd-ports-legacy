TclSpice is an improved version of Berkeley Spice designed to be used with
the Tcl/Tk scripting language. The project is open-source (BSD license)
and based upon the NG-Spice source code base with many improvements

Features and Improvements
 - Fully Tcl scriptable - installs with 'package require spice' statement
 - Hspice syntax (SpicePP).
 - GUI interfaces, various (Tk).
 - SpiceWish (BLT graph widget)
 - BLT (tcl compatible) vectors for storage, manipulation and arithmetic
	upon Spice waveforms.
 - Xspice additions (Georgia Tech).
 - Trigger upon waveform events.
 - Spice 'simulator state' save and restore for rapid 'what-if' simulations
	(no longer need to re-simulate from the beginning each time a
	device value is changed).
