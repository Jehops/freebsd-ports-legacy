SCEPTRE (System for Circuit Evaluation and Prediction of Transient
Radiation Effects) is a general purpose circuit analysis program which
provides all three major analyses, AC, DC, and transient analysis, on
either linear or nonlinear networks.  It employs a free-form input
language and state variable methods to simulate problems of interest
to electrical engineers.

This package does not include online documentation.  Documentation in
PDF format, in English and German, is available in the directory
work/sceptre*/doc.
