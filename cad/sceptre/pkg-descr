SCEPTRE (System for Circuit Evaluation and Prediction of Transient
Radiation Effects) is a general purpose circuit analysis program which
provides all three major analyses, AC, DC, and transient analysis, on
either linear or nonlinear networks.  It employs a free-form input
language and state variable methods to simulate problems of interest
to electrical engineers.
