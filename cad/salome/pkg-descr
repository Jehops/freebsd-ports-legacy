SALOME is a free software that provides a generic platform for Pre 
and Post-Processing for numerical simulation. 
+Supports interoperability between CAD modeling and 
 computation software (CAD-CAE link) 
+Makes easier the integration of new components on heterogeneous systems 
 for numerical computation 
+Sets the priority to multi-physics coupling between computation software 
+Provides a generic user interface, user-friendly and efficient, 
 which helps to reduce the costs and  delays of carrying out the studies
+Reduces training time to the specific time for learning the software solution
 which has been based on this platform 
+All functionalities are accessible through the programmatic 
 integrated Python console

This package contains meta-port.
