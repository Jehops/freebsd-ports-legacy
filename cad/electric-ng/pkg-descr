Electric is a sophisticated electrical CAD system that can handle
many forms of circuit design, including:
 - Custom IC layout (ASICs) 
 - Schematic drawing 
 - Hardware description language specifications 

Electric has these CAD operations:  
 - Design rule checking
 - Electrical rule checking
 - Simulation and simulation interface (many options)
 - Generation (ROMs, PLAs, Pad Frames, etc.)
 - Compaction
 - Routing 
 - VHDL compilation
 - Silicon compilation
 - Network consistency checking (LVS)
 - Logical Effort analysis
 - Project Management
       
Electric can display these types of design:
 - MOS (many CMOS and nMOS variations)
 - Bipolar and BiCMOS
 - Schematics and printed circuits
 - Digital filters, Temporal logic
 - Artwork

For real functionality, one should consider installing
support simulation software such as cad/spice.
