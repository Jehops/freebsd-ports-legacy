This is a Brazilian Portuguese, Linux version of the Netscape suite (AOL
Instant Messenger, Web browser, HTML editor, mail user agent and news reader).
Using the Linux version on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux
versions of plugins.  Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The
Macromedia Flash plugin is available in this port, as are the Brazilian region
pack, personal security manager, spell-checker, and talkback.  AOL Instant
Messenger is installed if the browser is selected.
