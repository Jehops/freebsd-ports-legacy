This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader).  Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java
and Macromedia Flash plugins are available.  AOL Instant Messenger
is omitted (see ports/net/aim).  The German, French and US- American
region packs, personal security manager, spell-checker, and talkback
are available.

For use with the Java plugin, linux_base-61 or linux_base-62 are
recommended (not linux_base-7).
