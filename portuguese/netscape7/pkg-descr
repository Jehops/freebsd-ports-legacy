This is a Brazilian Portuguese, Linux version of the Netscape suite
(AOL Instant Messenger, Web browser, HTML editor, mail user agent
and news reader).  Using the Linux version on FreeBSD is necessary
if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.  Many plugins are
distributed only as Linux binaries.  The Sun Java and Macromedia
Flash plugins are included in this port.  The Brazilian region pack,
personal security manager, spell-checker, and talkback are available.
