Version 2 of the FASTA packages contains many programs for searching DNA and
protein databases, performing sequence comparisons, producing local
alignments, and other related tasks.

Currently, the FASTA2 suite is in maintenance mode.  Updated versions of ONLY
the searching programs are available in version 3 of the FASTA packages,
which may be found in the port biology/fasta3.

FASTA is described in:  W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman (1988), "Improved
Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis", PNAS 85:2444- 2448, and W. R.
Pearson (1990) "Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA"
Methods in Enzymology 183:63- 98).

The FASTA2 suite is distributed freely subject to the condition that it may
not be sold or incorporated into a commercial product.
