Washington University BLAST (WU BLAST) version 2.0 is a powerful
software package for gene and protein identification, using sensitive,
selective and rapid similarity searches of protein and nucleotide
sequence databases. WU BLAST 2.0 builds upon WU BLAST 1.4, which in turn
was based on the public domain NCBI BLAST version 1.4. While NCBI BLAST
and WU BLAST 1.4 are in the public domain, WU BLAST 2.0 contains
significant new features and extended capabilities, the development of
which began in late 1994, at Washington University in Saint Louis. First
released in May 1996, or more than a year ahead of the NCBI, WU BLAST
2.0 is the original gapped BLAST with statistics and is known for
setting higher standards for sensitivity, speed, correctness and
accuracy, scalability and reliability than competing programs and
implementations. WU BLAST is neither a re-hashed nor "Mac-ified" version
of NCBI BLAST, although WU BLAST in many ways is easier to use. WU BLAST
essentially shares no code with NCBI BLAST, except for portions that
both packages derived from ungapped NCBI BLAST 1.4.
