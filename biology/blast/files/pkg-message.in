A sample configuration file has been installed in %%DATADIR%% and named
sysblast.sample. Edit it to suit your needs, rename it to 'sysblast' and
place it under /etc so that it can be recognized at runtime by the blast
executable.

Matrix files and filter executables have been placed in 
%%DATADIR%%/matrix and %%DATADIR%%/filter, respectively. 
You should set environment variables WUBLASTMAT and WUBLASTFILTER
(pointing to the respective directories) so that the blast executable
can find them.
