FinchTV is the popular way to view sequence traces on Linux, Mac OSX,
and Windows. FinchTV is the only trace viewer that can display an entire
trace in a scalable multi-pane view.

FinchTV reads chromatogram files from the most popular formats. In
addition to displaying a multi-color sequence above the trace, FinchTV
displays quality values (when available). You can adjust the scale in
both vertical and horizontal directions in either single or multipane
views.

FinchTV can:
o print traces (on a single page or control the number of panels printed)
o export sequences in FASTA format
o open gzipped files
o open files with drag and drop
o shows additional details about the file (sample ID, run start and stop
  times, spacing, mobility, lane number, etc.)
