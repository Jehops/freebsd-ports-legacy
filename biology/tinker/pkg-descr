Tinker is a set of small programs for doing general purpose molecular
modeling. Tools are included for energy minimizations, geometry
calculations, and molecular analysis calculations. Tools for converting
coordinate sets are also provided.

Tinker employs several force fields and minimizaation techniques.
Simulated annealing and molecular dynamics can be performed with Tinker.
