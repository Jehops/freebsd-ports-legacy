The LAGAN Toolkit consists of four components: 

 CHAOS, a pairwise local aligner optimized for non-coding, and other
 poorly conserved regions of the genome.
 
 LAGAN, a highly parametrizable pairwise global alignment using local
 alignments generated by CHAOS as anchors.
 
 Multi-LAGAN, a progressive pairwise algorithm to produce multiple
 sequence alignments.
 
 Shuffle-LAGAN, a novel glocal algorithm that is able to find
 rearrangements in a global alignment.
