This is version 4.5.2 of nab (nucleic acid builder), a computer
language that is intended for use in creating, describing and
modifying macromolecules, especially nucleic acids. Programs
written in nab are translated into C, which in turn is compiled
into machine code.

Although we have been using this code for some time now, users
should be aware that bugs may still exist.  Please see the file
COPYING for the usual disclaimer of liability.  Further
enhancements are planned, and will be announced on the web page.

Please send comments and suggestions to Tom Macke
(macke@scripps.edu) and/or to Dave Case (case@scripps.edu).  If
you find the program useful, please send us a note outlining your
applications.
