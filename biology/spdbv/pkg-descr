Swiss-PdbViewer is an application that provides a user friendly interface
allowing to analyse several proteins at the same time. The proteins can be
superimposed in order to deduce structural alignments and compare their
active sites or any other relevant parts. Amino acid mutations, H-bonds,
angles and distances between atoms are easy to obtain thanks to the
intuitive graphic and menu interface. 

Moreover, Swiss-PdbViewer is tightly linked to Swiss-Model, an automated
homology modelling server developped at Glaxo Welcome Experimental Research
in Geneva. Working with these two programs greatly reduces the amount of work
necessary to generate models, as it is possible to thread a protein primary
sequence onto a 3D template and get an immediate feedback of how well the
threaded protein will be accepted by the reference structure before
submitting a request to build missing loops and refine sidechain packing.

Swiss-PdbViewer can also read electron density maps, and provides various
tools to build into the density. In addition, various modelling tools are
integrated and command files for popular energy minimisation packages can be
generated.

Finally, as a special bonus, POV-Ray scenes can be generated from the
current view in order to make stunning ray-traced quality images.
