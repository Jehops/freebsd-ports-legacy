fastDNAml is a program for estimating maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees
from nucleotide sequences.

fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as Joseph Felsenstein's
DNAML, but to do so faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or
more bootstrap replicates become tractable. Much of fastDNAml is merely a
recoding of the PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
