SIMAP (Similarity Matrix of Proteins) is a public database of pre-calculated
protein similarities that plays a key role in many bioinformatics methods. It
contains about all currently published protein sequences and is continuously
updated.

The computational effort for keeping SIMAP up-to-date is constantly increasing.
Please help to update SIMAP by calculating protein similarities on your
computer.
