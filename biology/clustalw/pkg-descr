               CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program

Clustal W is a multiple alignment program for DNA or proteins.
Clustal W was written by Des Higgins (des@chah.ucc.ie), Julie Thompson
(julie@IGBMC.u-strasbg.fr), and Toby Gibson (Gibson@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE).
Version 2.0 has been completely rewritten in C++.
