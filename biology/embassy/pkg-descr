EMBASSY is a collection of contributed EMBOSS software. From the web
pages:

 "EMBOSS is GPL licensed. The libraries are under the Lesser GPL (LGPL).
 Programs which have been included from third parties who have their own
 licencing terms are kept apart under the EMBASSY grouping.

 This allows the EMBOSS libraries to link to other software, and only
 requires that software to have an LGPL-compatible licence. Phylip, for
 example, fits this model.

 But, to the user they do look exactly like EMBOSS aplications."
