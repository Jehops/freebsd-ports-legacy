Belvu is an X-windows viewer for multiple sequence alignments. One of the main
advantages of Belvu is that it has an extensive set of modes to color the
residues. There are several ways to color them by conservation and by residue
type (user-configurable). Other useful features are fetching of the Swissprot
(or PIR) entries by double clicking and easy tracking of the position in the
alignment.

Belvu further supports some simple editing commands for rows and columns, but
is not intended as a full editor. For actually editing the alignment, use your
favorite alignment editor or Emacs.
