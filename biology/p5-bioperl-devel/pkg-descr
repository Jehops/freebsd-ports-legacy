The Bioperl Project is an international association of developers of open
source Perl tools for bioinformatics, genomics and life science research. 

Bioperl is a collection of object-oriented Perl modules created by the
Bioperl Project.  It forms the basis of a large number of bioinformatics and
genomics applications.
