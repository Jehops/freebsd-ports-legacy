GP is a set of small utilities written in ANSI C to manipulate DNA
sequences in a Unix fashion, fit for combining within shell and cgi
scripts.

The sequences are usually in fasta format, that means the first line
is the sequence name starting with ">", and the sequence comes in the
next lines. The programs accept also gzipped sequence files.
