Artemis is a DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool that allows visualisation
of sequence features and the results of analyses within the context of the
sequence, and its six-frame translation.  Artemis is written in Java, reads
EMBL or GENBANK format sequences and feature tables, and can work on sequences
of any size.
