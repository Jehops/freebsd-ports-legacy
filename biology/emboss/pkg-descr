The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) is a
comprehensive set (about 100) of open source tools for genetic sequence
analysis.  EMBOSS is produced by the European Molecular Biology Network
(EMBnet - http://www.embnet.org/).

All EMBOSS tools are all built around the same set of core libraries - AJAX
and NUCLEUS - and therefore share a unified user interface and a uniform
sequence addressing methodology.

The various components of EMBOSS are distributed under the GPL, except the
core libraries which are under the LGPL.
