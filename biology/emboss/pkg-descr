The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) is a
comprehensive set (about 100) of open source tools for genetic sequence
analysis.  EMBOSS is produced by the European Molecular Biology Network
(EMBnet - http://www.embnet.org/).

All EMBOSS tools are all built around the same set of core libraries - AJAX
and NUCLEUS - and therefore share a unified user interface, have similar
"look and feel", and implement a uniform sequence addressing methodology.

The various components of EMBOSS are distributed under the GPL, except the
core libraries which are under the LGPL.

EMBASSY packages are third party applications which have been integrated with
the EMBOSS suite, but which are not included in the base EMBOSS distribution
for licensing or other reasons.  This port includes the currently available
EMBASSY applications - EMNU, MSE, PHYLIP and TOPO.  During an interactive
install the user will be asked to choose which of these will be installed
(default: all).  Note that the EMBASSY version of PHYLIP should not clash
with the standalone Phylip application due to the fact that its binaries have
been renamed.
