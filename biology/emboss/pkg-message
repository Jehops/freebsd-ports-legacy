The EMBOSS suite has been successfully installed.

In order to use the EMBOSS programs, you will need to set some environment
variables in your shell startup file.  If EMBOSS was installed to the
default prefix, then:

- set PLPLOT_LIB to:     "/usr/local/share/EMBOSS"
- set EMBOSS_ACDROOT to: "/usr/local/share/EMBOSS/acd"

NB:  A sample configuration file has been installed to /usr/local/etc as
emboss.default.sample.  This must be renamed to emboss.default and edited
to suit your site and its requirements.

A .embossrc in a user's home directory overrides settings in the
system-wide emboss.default.

Further EMBOSS documentation is available at:

The EMBOSS administrator's guide is available in various formats at:
