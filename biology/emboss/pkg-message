The EMBOSS suite has been successfully installed.

In order to use the EMBOSS programs, you will need to set some environment
variables in your shell startup file.

- set PLPLOT_LIB to:     "%%PREFIX%%/share/EMBOSS"
- set EMBOSS_ACDROOT to: "%%PREFIX%%/share/EMBOSS/acd"

NB:  A sample configuration file has been installed to %%PREFIX%%/etc as
emboss.default.sample.  This must be renamed to emboss.default and edited
to suit your site and its requirements.

A .embossrc in a user's home directory overrides settings in the
system-wide emboss.default.
