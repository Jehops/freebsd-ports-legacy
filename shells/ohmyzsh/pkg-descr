Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh
configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town or your
money back! With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of
the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to
you in cafes and ask yo, "that is amazing! are you some sort of genis?"

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you
deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing
more often.
