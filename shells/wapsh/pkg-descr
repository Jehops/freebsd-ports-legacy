htsh/wapsh is a system implemented by exolution GmbH which allows
users to login to a Unix shell on a remote host using a web browser
or WAP phone (in the latter incarnation, htsh is also called wapsh).

The following phones and emulators have been successfully tested with
htsh:
  * Nokia 6210
  * Nokia 7110
  * Siemens C35 and S35
  * Nokia WAP Toolkit 2.0 "Blueprint" phone emulator
  * UP.Simulator 4.0 from Phone.com

We welcome feedback (at wapsh@exolution.de) from users about their
experiences using other phone types.
