Ambit, at its simplest, uses  Bash Brace Expansion  to expand and list
hostnames OR commands. First and foremost Ambit is meant to be a general
purpose hostlist enumerator to be used by other applications or scripts.
Additionally Ambit can be used to manage User Specific as well as
System-Wide HostGroups. It can also be used to query Network HostGroups.
Finally, Ambit is able to detect when it is expanding a command (rather than
a host list), allowing for the command to be expanded and executed
synchronously. This means Ambit can expand and run just about anything on
the command line and usually works in places where Bash Brace Expansion
might fail.
