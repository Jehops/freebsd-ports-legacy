+This is a port of SASH to FreeBSD 4.0. Here are the differences to
+the original version:
+
+* The Makefile was rewritten to make use of standard BSD makefiles.
+  This helps integrating SASH into binaries built with crunchgen.
+
+* This port contains only a subset of 'mount -t type' commands. The
+  types that are supported are:
+
+	ufs,msdos,ext2fs,cd9660
+
+  (the naming follows standard mount(8) command in FreeBSD).
+
+  However, the only supported options for mounting are either read/write
+  (default, except for cd9660), read-only, or updating the mount
+  (NOTE: the original code uses '-m', but I changed it to '-u'
+  to be consistent with standard FreeBSD mount(8) ).
+
+  Also, the built-in mount command doesn't even attempt to autoload
+  requested vfs KLD, if it's not present in the kernel. In such
+  case, the mount operation will fail.
+
+* The code has been modularized (in similar way it was done for ELKS
+  version), so you can easier select which parts you want to include.
+  See the Makefile for the options.
