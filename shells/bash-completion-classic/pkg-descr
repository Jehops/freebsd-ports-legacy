This is a programmable completion library for bash users. It features the
ability to tab-complete arguments for many common programs.

This is the original project which became later shells/bash-completion. The new
version is developed by a new group and has some very nice new features.
Unfortunately, the new version currently causes problems on amd64 systems.
People with amd64 systems may use this classic version as an alternative.
