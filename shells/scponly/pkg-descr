[From the README:]  "scponly" is an alternative 'shell' (of sorts) for system
administrators who would like to provide access to remote users to both read
and write local files without providing any remote execution priviledges.
Functionally, it is best described as a wrapper to the "tried and true" ssh
suite of applications.

scponly validates remote requests by examining the third argument passed to the
shell upon login.  (The first argument is the shell itself, and the second is
-c.)  The only commands allowed are "scp" (for ssh1), "sftp-server" (for ssh2")
and "ls".  Arguments to these commands are passed along unmolested.
