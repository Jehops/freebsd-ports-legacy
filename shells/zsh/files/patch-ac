  A character may be @dfn{quoted} (that is, made to stand for itself) by
  preceding it with a @code{\}.  @code{\} followed by a newline is
  ignored.  All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes
! (@t{@value{dsq}}) are quoted, except the first character of @code{histchars}
  (@code{!} by default).  A single quote cannot appear within single
  quotes.  Inside double quotes (@code{""}), parameter and command
