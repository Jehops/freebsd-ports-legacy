# Don't use IDEA. IDEA can be freely used for non-commercial use. However,
# commercial use may require a licence in a number of countries. Since SSH
# itself may not be used for commercial purposes without a license, we
# enable IDEA by default since the user would already be getting himself
# into trouble.
