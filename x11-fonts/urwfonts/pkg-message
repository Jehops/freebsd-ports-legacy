============================================================
You'll have to add /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/URW
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/URW
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/X11/xorg.conf) and restarting the X-server.
