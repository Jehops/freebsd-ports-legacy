Fontilus is a set of extensions for Nautilus to help manage fonts on
your system.  It consists of a number of components:
                                                                                
  - libfont-method: a gnome-vfs method implementing the fonts:/// URI
    scheme.
                                                                                
  - gnome-thumbnail-font: a program to render a small preview of a
    font.  Uses a custom stream implementation, so can render fonts
    from arbitrary gnome-vfs URIs (provided the file can be openned in
    random access mode).  For example, it can render files in
    fonts:///
                                                                                
  - gnome-font-viewer: a simple program to display info about a font
    and render some of the glyphs.
