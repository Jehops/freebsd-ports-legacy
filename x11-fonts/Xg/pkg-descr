Unicode fonts
=============

The new libXg distribution supports Unicode.  Sam and 9term built using
the new UTF libXg will allow one to enter and edit files containing
Unicode characters encoded using UTF-2 (UTF-FSS).  The software
takes care of all this encoding.  Sam may be used to enter the files
and when displayed in a suitable 9term window will be seen in all
their Unicode glory.  The font bundle is an integral part of this.
It contains bdf files of fonts which are used to span various ranges
of the Unicode space.

To use them:

o	convert the bdf files to whatever format is appropriate for
	your system and place the files in a suitable common directory
o	set this directory up as an X font directory by running some
	program such as `mkfontdir' if necessary
o	add the directory to your fontpath `xset fp+ fontdir'
o	make sure libXg knows about the fontfile you wish to use by
	setting the appropriate .p9font X resource (or just *p9font) to
	be something like /lib/font/Xg/matty/unicode.9.font or by
	specifying an appropriate -p9font argument to libXg programs.

I am currently using these headers on outgoing Unicode mail, however
I do not vouch for their correctness.  They do provide a bit of clue
as to what is going on 'though.

	Mime-Version: 1.0
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=X-utf-2
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I am working on a program to convert UTF-2 streams into reasonable
ascii aproximations where possible.

If you create any more fonts or add to the existing fonts, please
drop me a line so I can add them to the distribution and my collection.
