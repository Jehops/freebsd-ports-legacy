	For  your X-server  to use  the fonts,  you have  to add
	the  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/X11/fonts/koi8-u-gemini (LOCALBASE is,
	usually, /usr/local)  to  the server's  font-path.  Use
	``xset fp+''  to do this  for the current  X-session and
	consult  your  X-server's  documentation  to  make  this
	permanent.
