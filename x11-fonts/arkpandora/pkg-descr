This font pack is designed for screen and print and as a "drop-in"
replacement for Arial and Time New Roman.

You get the following fonts: Aerial, Aerial Mono, Tymes & Veranda.

It will automatically make the fonts recognizable by the system.  It
also makes Aerial the default font for the Sans-Serif and Tymes the
Serif font types.

The fonts are derived from the Bitstream Vera fonts and are available
under the same terms as Vera.
