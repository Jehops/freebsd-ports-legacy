This port is for International Fonts excluding what distributed with X
Window Systems.

This contains free X11 fonts for all characters that Emacs and XEmacs
can handle. They are classified into several categories.

European -- European normal size fonts (suitable with the other fonts)
European-BIG -- European big fonts
Asian -- Asian (non-CJK) fonts
Chinese  -- Chinese normal size fonts excluding what distributed with X
Chinese.BIG -- Chinese big fonts
Japanese -- Japanese normal size fonts excluding what distributed with X
Japanese.BIG -- Japanese big fonts
Ethiopic -- Ethiopic fonts
Misc -- fonts for the other regions/scripts
TrueType -- Truetype fonts
Type1 -- Postscript Type1 fonts

If you want to use TrueType fonts on X, you should run X-TT or xfsft.
Then you had better use mkttfdir in perlftlib or ttmkfdir to create
fonts.dir or fonts.scale.
