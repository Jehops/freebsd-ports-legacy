Note: The port x11-fonts/fonts-indic is a collection of Indic font by the
Lohit project and installs a font subset of this port, the Lohit family;
but, although the origin of fonts is the same, the Lohit project, that
distfile is maintained by Gentoo people, and could have different
revisions. The principal difference to notice is that the gentoo distfile
provides the Lohit support for the Malayalam language, that the Debian
people didn't want include, because, for an old problem, it doesn't work
very well with the present rendering engine. In any way you can install
both the port without any problems. If you need Malayalam support for the
Lohit family, you can install merely also that port and, if, for any
reasons, you want to use a particular font set, you have to change the
loading priority in your configuration files.
