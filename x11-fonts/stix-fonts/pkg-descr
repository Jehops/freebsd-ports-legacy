The mission of the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange (STIX) font
creation project is the preparation of a comprehensive set of fonts that serve
the scientific and engineering community in the process from manuscript creation
through final publication, both in electronic and print formats. Toward this
purpose, the STIX fonts will be made available, under royalty-free license, to
anyone, including publishers, software developers, scientists, students, and the
general public.

These fonts cover all the symbols in MathML and this port can replace the former
x11-fonts/mathfonts.
