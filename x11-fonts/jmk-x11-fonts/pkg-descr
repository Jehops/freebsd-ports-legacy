Jim Knoble's font collection for X

You'll have to add /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/jmk
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/jmk
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the X-server.
