This is a collection of ATM fonts from the CICA Windows
archives.  They are particularly useful with gimp.

You'll have to add /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/freefont
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/freefont
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the X-server.

Some of these fonts are shareware, and some have restrictions on
redistribution.  Please consult the accompanying .license files
after installation.
