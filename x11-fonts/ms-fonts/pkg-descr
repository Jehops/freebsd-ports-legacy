This is a set of True Type fonts available for download from MicroSoft's
web-site. You can  use them if your X-server supports  .ttf fonts (or if
you have other  applications for fonts). A good thing  about them is the
multi-charset support.

You'll  have to  add /usr/local/share/ms-fonts  to your  X font-path  by
either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/local/share/ms-fonts
$ xset fp rehash

and/or  by  adding  it  to your  X-server  configuration  file  (usually
/etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the X-server.
