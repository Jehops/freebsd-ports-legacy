The wqy font includes all the CJK characters covered by the Unicode
Standard 4.0.

This font is created by merging GNU Unifont (by Roman Czyborra
<roman@czyborra.com> and David Starner <dvdeug@debian.org>) with GBK 16 font
from yh-3.1 (Yan Huang Chinese Platform, Redflag Linux,
http://www.redflag-linux.com/).

The CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00~U+9FA5) are now complete, and the quality
of the bitmaps has improved significantly.

This release is part of an ongoing effort from the WenQuanYi Project to
create high-quality open-source bitmap Chinese fonts.

Currently only bitmap fonts are available. TTF fonts are in progress.
