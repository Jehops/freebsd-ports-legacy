This is a collection of shareware ATM fonts from the CICA Windows
archives.  They are particularly useful with gimp.

You'll have to add /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/sharefont
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/sharefont
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the X-server.

NOTE: These fonts are SHAREWARE.  You must pay a fee if you find that you
are using them a lot.  Please read the *.shareware files in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/sharefont for each font's licensing restrictions.
