Mule-UCS is an Emacs Lisp library to define encoding/decoding schemes by
rather simple translation rule.

Emacs prepares encoding/decoding schemes in the following 2 mechanisms.

  (A) ... built-in ISO/IEC 2022 encoder/decoder
  (B) ... Code Conversion Language(CCL) engine

Although (A) provides powerful encoding/decoding schemes as to
ISO/IEC 2022, we cannot utilize this for any other encoding schemes.
(B) is a simple register machine. However, CCL program is arcane
language because it is infamous and mysterious:-P.

Mule-UCS provides flexible and comprehensible encoding mechanism to Emacs.
Currently, Mule-UCS generates CCL program from the translation rule, but
in the future, Mule-UCS may support another conversion engine on Emacs.

Predefined conversions for Mule-UCS included in this package are:

  *  Unicode(UTF-7/8/16) support.
  *  Big5 <-> CNS conversion support.
