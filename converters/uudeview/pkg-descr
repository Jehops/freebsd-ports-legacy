This is a powerful program at which you can throw a mess of 
unordered files in any of BinHex, uuencoded, xxencoded, or 
Base64 formats and expect them all to be properly decoded.
It even handles encodings that have been garbled by certain
versions of Netscape/MS-Explorer or encodings that are missing
some parts!

It is also able to encode in all of the above formats except for 
BinHex.
