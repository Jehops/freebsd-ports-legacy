This was originally one distribution for UUdeview, but I have broken
it up into ``libuu', ``uudeview'', and ``xdeview'', hopefully making
it cleaner and more useful.  Patches are available from the author's
website to add ``libuu'' decoding to popular newsreaders, additionally.

The source itself is quite portable and required no patching.

The package is covered under the GNU license.
