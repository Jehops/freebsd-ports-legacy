[ excerpt from distfile's README with modifications ]

This is the first version of TASM to AT&T converter (TA2AS). Frank
van Dijk, member of SPiRiT!, wrote this utility. It reads in a
source file with TASM syntax and tries(first version remember? :))
to convert it to AT&T syntax.  It hasn't been tested very well. So
email all your bugreports to one of the SPiRiT emailaddresses (see
below). Also for wanted features!  But the sourcefile is included
so why don't you try first :)

This is one of the utilities we wrote, to make life easier when
working with DJGPP! :)
