ICONV is 1) the library (libiconv.a and .so) for conversion between
various charsets and 2) the command line utility (iconv).

33 charsets are supported in this port: most Unicode encodings,
all charsets for which locale exist in FreeBSD, few IBM-DOS ones.
Other charsets are provided as standalone ports.
