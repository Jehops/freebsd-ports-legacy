This was originally one distribution for uudeview, but I broke it up
to make it cleaner and more useful.  It is now uulib, uudeview.  Once
I learn more about tcl (or someone else does it), I'll have to make
the third part -- xdeview.

Because it is split up, it is possible for other (theoretical future)
ports to use libuu.a.  I dare say it also makes the whole thing that
much cleaner.

The source itself is quite portable and required no patching.
