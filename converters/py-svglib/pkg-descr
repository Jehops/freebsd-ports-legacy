Svglib is an experimental library for reading SVG files and converting
them(to a reasonable degree) to other formats using the Open Source
ReportLab Toolkit. As a package it reads existing SVG files and returns
them converted to ReportLab Drawing objects that can be used in a
variety of ReportLab-related contexts, e.g. as Platypus Flowable objects
or in RML2PDF. As a command-line tool it converts SVG files into PDF
ones.
