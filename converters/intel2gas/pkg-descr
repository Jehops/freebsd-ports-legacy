[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

Intel2GAS is a converter that will convert assembler source files
written for NASM to files that can be assembled using the GNU
Assembler (GAS), on the i386 platform. It provides support for basic
MMX instructions as well.

This converter was written for the Hermes project and is now released
to the general public. The code inside this converter is extremely
flexible, you can write a syntax file to convert between any two
assembler languages on a good day.. :)
