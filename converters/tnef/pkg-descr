This program decodes those annoying application/ms-tnef MIME attachments that
Microsoft mail servers helpfully use to encapsulate your already MIME encoded
attachments.

Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers,
more and more mail is encapsulated into this format.

The TNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated
into the TNEF attachment.  Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook
to view them.
