Konwert is a package for conversion between various character encodings.        

By encodings author imply not only different charsets like Windows-1252,
KOI8-R or UTF-8 but also the different representations of characters like
TeX escaping, quoted-printable and even RFC 1345 mnemonics.

There are also filter filterm which allow to make separate input and output
conversions of the encodings for the given command. It can help e.g. when
our terminal is unable to display non-ASCII characters or to enter them
from the keyboard.
