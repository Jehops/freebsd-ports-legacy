 Caitoo
========

Caitoo (formerly known as KGet) is a download manager similar to
Go!zilla(tm) or GetRight Download(tm). It keeps all your downloads
in one dialog and you can add and remove transfers. Transfers can
be paused, resumed, queued or scheduled. Dialogs display info about
status of transfers - progress, size, speed and remaining time.
Program supports drag & drop from KDE applications and Netscape.
