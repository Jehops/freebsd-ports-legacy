Spegla is a mirror program for FTP sites.  It was written because I
couldn't find any fast mirroring program for big mirrors. It makes a
complete mirror of a FTP area.

Spegla only take one command-line parameter, the config file.  These
parameters can be specified in it:

 - localdir   where the mirror should go on your machine.

 - remotedir  directory at the FTP server.

 - username   user to log in as i.e. anonymous.

 - password   password to use i.e. your email address.

 - host       FTP server.

 - retries    how many retries before quit. Defaults to 20.

 - retrytime  how many seconds to wait before log in again after
              a timeout. Defaults to 150.

 - timeout    how many seconds to wait to timeout. Defaults to 150.

 - skipdir    which directories to ignore remote and local, can be
              several but only one per row.

 - dirlink    not used for now.

 - logfile    logfile, can be a file, stdout or stderr. Defaults
              to stdout.

Blank lines and text after '#' are ignored.

This is what's in the config file I use for the FreeBSD mirror of
Walnut Creek's FreeBSD area.

localdir  = /ftp/pub/FreeBSD
remotedir = /pub/FreeBSD
username  = anonymous
password  = jnilsson@ludd.luth.se
host      = ftp.freebsd.org
timeout   = 120
retries   = 300       # busy ftp server and lots of files.
                      # Takes lots of hours to complete
                      # and don't want to quit when we are
                      # almost finished.
retrytime = 120       # if network goes down don't consume
                      # all retries to fast.
logfile   = freebsd.org.log
skipdir   = distfiles # don't have room for this yet.
skipdir   = incoming  # no need for this.
