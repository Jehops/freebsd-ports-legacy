                     * FTP search 1.0 alpha *

This is an alpha version of FTP search. FTP search is a program
for indexing/searching in the contents on ftp servers. Now you 
can have your own small scale server indexing your ftp server
only. 

After performing make/make install of this port, you must go to
/usr/local/ftpsearch and perform `make setup' to configure the
software for the first time. If it fails, you may have to edit
/usr/local/ftpsearch/etc/sites a little (specifying the ftp server
you want to index), and check the file in with rcs again. Then you
can try `make setup' one more. If it fails this time too, read the
INSTALL file and examine the logs.

If you have lots of network bandwidth, CPU, RAM and disk space, you
can configure it to index almost every ftp server. It is recommended
that you cooperate with others running an FTP search server, to avoid
loading the same long-distance links with multiple transfers of the
same ls listings. 

This is the software that runs on ftpsearch.ntnu.no. That machine is a
PC running FreeBSD 3.0-current. It has 15 GB disk, a 100 MHz Pentium
processor, 128 MB memory and 2 MS160SE cards with 96 MB RAM on each
card. It currently indexes 4700 ftp servers, with over 66 million
files, and handles around 550000 requests/day with this software.
