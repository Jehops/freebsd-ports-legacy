                     FTP search 1.0

FTP search is a program for indexing/searching in the contents on ftp servers.
Now you can have your own small scale server indexing your ftp server only. 

After performing make/make install of this port, you must go to
/usr/local/ftpsearch and perform `make setup' to configure the software for the
first time. If it fails, you may have to edit /usr/local/ftpsearch/etc/sites 
a little (specifying the ftp server you want to index), and check the file in 
with rcs again. Then you can try `make setup' one more. If it fails this time
too, read the INSTALL file and examine the logs.
