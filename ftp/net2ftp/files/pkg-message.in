%%PKGNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%WWWDIR%%


To make net2ftp available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /net2ftp/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/">
	 Options none
	 AllowOverride Limit
	 
	 Order Deny,Allow
	 Deny from all
	 Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>
