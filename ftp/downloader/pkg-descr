Downloader for X is a Linux/Unix user-friendly program with nice X interface
to download files from the Internet.  It supports both FTP and HTTP
protocols, supports resuming (of course if server side supports it) and
makes downloading files from the Internet easy.  Downloader for X resembles
such famous applications for Windows as ReGet, Go!Zilla, and GetRight.

Quite incompleted list of key features:

    * Supports both FTP and HTTP protocols as well as HTTP and FTP proxy
      servers.  SOCKS5 support is also included.
    * Allows users to manage their downloads in real time.
    * Recursive downloads via FTP as well as via HTTP are supported.
    * Powerful Filters Manager allow advanced user to specify files which
      must to be downloaded and files which must to be skipped.
    * Ability to download in more than one connection per time.
    * Supports of so called "persistent connections", which increases speed of
      downloading due much less amount of "standing connection" stages.
    * Built-in Scheduler, URL Manager and "Automatically adding" allow
      advanced user to simplify managing downloads by various criteria.
    * Multi-queued design, ability to run without X interface, manageability
      via command line, and many other cool features...
