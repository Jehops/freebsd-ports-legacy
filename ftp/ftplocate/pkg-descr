FtpLocate is a fast FTP search engine written with Perl. It supports 
indexing on multiple FTP servers and generates summaries for them. 

FtpLocate provides the user two methods for searching: filename search and 
description search. Filename search groups the results by FTP servers, 
displaying the server nearest to the client first. With description search, 
a user can find the files he wants without knowing the filename. Files with 
same description will be grouped together.
