From the README:

 What is GWget
 =============
 GWget allows the user to retrieve multiple files from the web. These
 files can be retrieved in multiple parts and each part retrieved on a
 separate session that the user is connected to the Internet. This is
 most useful to users with dialup connections. The program performs
 this tasks using wget as it's back-end.
