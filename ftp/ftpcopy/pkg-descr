Two command line ftp tools.

ftpcopy is a simply FTP client written to copy files or directories
(recursively) from a FTP server. It's main purpose is to mirror FTP sites which
support the EPLF directory listing format, although it also supports the
traditional listing format (/bin/ls). 

ftpls is a FTP client which generates directory listings, either in plain text
or HTML. 

The tools only support passive mode FTP.
