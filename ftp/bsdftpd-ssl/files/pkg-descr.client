BSDftpd-ssl is a TLS/SSL-enhanced FTP server. This package contains
command-line FTP client utility (ftps). The TLS/SSL enhancement allows RFC2228
"FTP Security Extensions"-compliant TLS/SSL support for both control and data
connections; with standard FTP servers this software operates as the standard
FTP client.
