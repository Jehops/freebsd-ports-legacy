   LFTP is a shell-like command line ftp client. 
   The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability
and ability to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and
reget the file being transferred if the connection broke.
   You can start a transfer in background and continue browsing 
on the ftp site.  It does this all in one process. When you have
started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the
transfers.
   It has also such nice features as reput and mirror.
