mGet is a command line download manager. It splits the file into a number
of segments and uses several separate threads to download each segment.
It can handle proxies and can tunnel through them to get files blocked by
proxies.  Currently mGet only handles HTTP downloads directly, while FTP
downloads must go through a proxy.
