 <p class="level0"><a name="--post301"></a><span class="nroffip">--post301</span> 
 <p class="level1">Tells curl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using <a class="emphasis" href="#-L--location">-L/--location</a> (Added in 7.17.1)
