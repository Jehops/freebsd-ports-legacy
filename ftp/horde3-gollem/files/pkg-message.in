Gollem has been installed in %%HORDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured; if not, see `pkg_info -Dx horde-base'.

Note: you have to configure an appropriate backend in
%%HORDIR%%/config/backends.php.

Finally, you must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
configuration.
