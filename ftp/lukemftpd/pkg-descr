`lukemftpd' is what many users affectionately call the enhanced ftp
server in NetBSD.

The enhancements over the standard ftp server in 4.4BSD include:

        * command line options:
                + allow override of directory used by anonymous ftp (-a)
                + optional change of directory for configuration files (-c)
                + check whether a user would be granted access (-C)
                + specify email address for display messages (-e)
                + change hostname advertised as (-h, -H)
                + specify data port to listen on (-P)
                + keep track of the number of users logged in (-q, -Q)
                + permanently drop privileges (-r)
                + specify version advertised (-V)
                + log wu-ftpd style `xferlog' entries to syslog (-X)

        * IPv6 support (from the KAME project).

        * +++ (see README)
