bftpd is an FTP server for Linux, BSD/OS, FreeBSD, Solaris, DG-UX
and Tru64.  It runs either with inetd or standalone.

It tries to be very configurable while being fast and small. You
can make defaults for each configuration option, and then override
these defaults in user-specific structures. Support for
directory-specific options is planned.

Features of bftpd include:
	* Easy configuration
	* Speed
	* Support for most RFC FTP commands
	* tar.gz on-the-fly compression/archiving
	* Security with chroot without special setup
	* No need for filessh, ls...) in a chroot environment
	* Logging to wtmp and to a config file
	* PAM and passwd/shadow support
	* Support for SITE CHOWN/CHMOD
