pftpx is a ftp proxy with many advanced features such as:

1) it handles all ftp modes: PORT, PASV, EPRT, EPSV
2) it handles ipv6
3) it should scale: one process handles all sessions using libevent
4) it works with "strict" ftp clients (clients that want data connections 
   to the same IP as the control connection)
