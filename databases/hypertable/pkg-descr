Hypertable is a high performance distributed data storage system
designed to support applications requiring maximum performance,
scalability, and reliability.

Hypertable will be particularly invaluable to any organization that
needs to manage rapidly evolving data to support demanding real-time
applications.  Modeled after Google's well known Bigtable project,
Hypertable is designed to manage the storage and processing of
information on a large cluster of commodity servers, providing
resilience to machine and component failures.  Hypertable seeks to set
the open source standard for highly available, petabyte scale, database
systems.
