PBL (Peter Graf's Program Base Library) is a library with highly portable
database functions that can be used in a C or C++ project.

The code of the PBL library includes:

 - PBL BASE - some base functions (pbl_*)
 - PBL HASH - a memory hash table implementation (pblHt*)
 - PBL KEYFILE - a key file implementation (pblKf*)
 - PBL ISAM - an ISAM file implementation (pblIsam*)

The spamprobe project (mail/spamprobe) can be used with PBL databases.
