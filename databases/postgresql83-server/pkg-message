      * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE *

The PostgreSQL port now obeys hier(7) by default, which means that it
installs into:

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/include  (NOTE! Changed again in 7.2, since PostgreSQL
                           handles standard install nowadays)

You *must* move away your pre-7.1 installation from users' and
ldconfig(8)'s PATHs.

The pgsql user's home dir is /usr/local/pgsql by default, but can be
changed with for example chpass(1). Datadir defaults to ~pgsql/data,
but can be changed by modifying the ~pgsql/.profile script.

======================================================================

To initialize the database, you should run initdb as the "pgsql" user
(if you want to use your locale for collation, edit ~pgsql/.profile
and set the locale to your preference first).

Example:

  su -l pgsql -c initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start
