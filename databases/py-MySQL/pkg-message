WARNING: This port is a very old Python MySQL interface which doesn't actively
         maintained by its authors anymore. Some efforts were required to make
         it working with newest versions of MySQL, and it is highly likely
         that further MySQL development would make hard or even impossible to
         get this module working in the future.

         The better port named py-MySQLdb available, which should be used in
         all cases where compatability and future maintainability is desirable.
