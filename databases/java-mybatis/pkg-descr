MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for custom
SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings.  MyBatis eliminates almost
all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters and retrieval of
results.  MyBatis can use simple XML or Annotations for configuration and
map primitives, Map interfaces and Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)
to database records.
