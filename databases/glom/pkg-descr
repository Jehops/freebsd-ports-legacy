With Glom you can design table definitions and the relationships
between them, plus arrange the fields on the screen. You can edit
and search the data in those tables, and specify field values in
terms of other fields. It's as easy as it should be.

The design is loosely based on FileMaker Pro, with the added
advantage of separation between interface and data. Its simple
framework should be enough to implement most database
applications. Without Glom these systems normally consist of lots
of repetitive, unmaintainable code.

Glom-specific data such as the relationship definitions is saved
in the Glom document. Glom re-connects to the database server
when it loads a previous Glom document. The document is in XML
format.

Glom uses the PostgreSQL database backend but it can not edit
databases that it did not create, because it uses only a simple
subset of Postgres functionality.
