DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning database table definitions and setting
up the columns and primary keys.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader currently supports DBI for MySQL,
PostgreSQL, SQLite and DB2.

See DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::DBI::Writing for notes on writing your
own vendor-specific subclass for an unsupported DBD driver.

This module requires DBIx::Class 0.06 or later, and obsoletes the older
DBIx::Class::Loader.

This module is designed more to get you up and running quickly against
an existing database, or to be effective for simple situations, rather
than to be what you use in the long term for a complex database/project.
