THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. This is 0.01xxx, the first public
releases. Expect things to be broken in various ways. Expect the entire
design to be fatally flawed. Expect the interfaces to change if it
becomes neccessary. It's mostly here for people to poke at it and find
the flaws in it. 0.02 will hopefully have some sanity when we get there.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning table schemas and setting up columns and
primary keys.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader supports MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and DB2.
See DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Generic for more, and
DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Writing for notes on writing your own
db-specific subclass for an unsupported db.

This module requires DBIx::Class 0.05 or later, and obsoletes
DBIx::Class::Loader for DBIx::Class version 0.05 and later.
