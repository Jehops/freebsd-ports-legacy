TOra is a well-featured QT based GUI database administration toolkit for
Oracle. It has some, limited support for MySQL. Due to the lack of native
Oracle libraries for FreeBSD, this port only supports MySQL (and a limited set
of features). It's still a very polished application with a lot of
potential.
