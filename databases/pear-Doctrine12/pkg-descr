Doctrine is an object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP 5.2.3+ that
sits on top of a powerful database abstraction layer (DBAL).

One of its key features is the option to write database queries in a
proprietary object oriented SQL dialect called Doctrine Query
Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernate's HQL. This provides developers
with a powerful alternative to SQL that maintains flexibility without
requiring unnecessary code duplication.
