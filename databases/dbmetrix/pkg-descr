dbMetrix is a copy-lefted, open-sourced SQL database tool. My goal is to
write a very graphical, clean, consistent, modularized front end to
various (currently opensourced) SQL servers. I plan to incorporate
administration utilities, sql dumps, dbf2sql/sql2dbf and client support
for all supported data sources. My motivation for writing dbMetrix is a
current lack of nice, truely GUI SQL admin/client tools. Most of the tools
available are written for a single, specific SQL server in mind and are
usually only a GUI-fied text interface. dbMetrix supports multiple and
various SQL servers simultaneously, however it is not a multi-threaded
application.
