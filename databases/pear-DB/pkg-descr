PEAR::DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* ordered array, associative array and object formats supported for the fetched
  rows
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database extensions. The currently
supported extensions are: dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql,
mysql, oci8, odbc, pgsql and sybase (DB style interfaces to LDAP servers and
MS ADO (using COM) are also avaible from a separate package).
