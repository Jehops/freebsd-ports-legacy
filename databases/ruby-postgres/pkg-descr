This is an extention module to access PostgreSQL database from Ruby.

Older module, maintained for backwards compatibility. It has known flaws
that aren't reasonably fixable without breaking backwards compatibility.
Use this module if you have code that already works, and you just want
the fixes that have been committed to this module (for instance,
this module is compatible with PostgreSQL 8.3).
