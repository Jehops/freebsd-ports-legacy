PHP's database access functions are not standardized.
Every database extension uses a different and incompatibile API.
This creates a need for a database class library to hide the differences
between the different databases (encapsulate the differences) so we can
easily switch databases.

ADODB stands for Active Data Objects Data Base.

ADODB currently supports: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Interbase, Oracle, MS SQL 7,
Foxpro, Access, ADO, Sybase and generic ODBC.
The Sybase and PostgreSQL drivers are community contributions.
The developers of ABODB hope more people will contribute drivers to support
more databases.

Feature requests and bug reports can be emailed to jlim@natsoft.com.my or
