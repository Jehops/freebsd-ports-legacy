ADODB stands for Active Data Objects Data Base.

ADODB currently supports: 
	MySQL, PostgreSQL, Interbase, Oracle, MS SQL 7
	Foxpro, Access, ADO, Sybase and generic ODBC.

Unique Features of ADODB:

* Easy for Windows programmers to adapt to because many of the conventions 
  are similar to Microsoft's ADO.

* Unlike other PHP database classes which focus only on select statements
  ADODB provides support code to handle inserts and updates which can be
  adapted to multiple databases quickly. Methods are provided for date
  handling, string concatenation and string quoting characters for 
  differing databases.

* A metatype system is built in so that types such as CHAR, TEXT and STRING
  are equivalent in different databases.

* Easy to port because all the database dependant code are stored in stub
  functions. You do not need to port the core logic of the classes.

* PHP4 session support. You can store your session information using ADODB
  for true portability and scalability. See adodb-session.php for more 
  information.
