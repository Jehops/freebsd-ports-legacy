 From udbc.doc:

    WHAT IS UDBC?

    UDBC is OpenLink's acronym for Universal DataBase Connectivity.

    In short, UDBC is the merge between the X/Open - SAG interface and
    the Microsoft ODBC interface for client database applications.

    UDBC was developped to enable software engineers to rapidly develop
    database independent applications without being concerned about issues
    like portability, network programming and database specific interfacing
    problems.
