           Geographical Resources Analysis Support System
                              (GRASS)

A public domain, image processing and geographic information system (GIS)
originally developed by researchers in the Environmental Division of the US
Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories in Champaign, Illinois,
with enhancements and support now performed by the GRASS Research Group at
Baylor University.

The GRASS system is used to input, manipulate, analyze, and output
geographic data by users in both military and nonmilitary, public and
private agencies based in North America, Europe, and other parts of the
world.
