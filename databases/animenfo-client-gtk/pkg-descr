The AnimeNfo client with GTK support.

configuration.txt contains the configuration for server and port.
It will be read automatically by the program at beginning of execution,
so you don't have to fill the server and port value every time manually.
You can modify the configuration.txt file if necessary.
In order for the configuration.txt to work,
you have to put it in the same directory as the program.
