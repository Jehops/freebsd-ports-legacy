  message: <<EOM
MariaDB respects hier(7) and doesn't check /etc and /etc/mysql for
my.cnf. Please move existing my.cnf files from those paths to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql or %%PREFIX%%/etc. Sample
configuration files are provided in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql
and %%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql/conf.d.

This port does NOT include the mytop perl script, this is included in
the MariaDB tarball but the most recent version can be found in the
databases/mytop port

  message: <<EOM
Remember to run mariadb-upgrade (with the optional --datadir=<dbdir> flag)
the first time you start the MySQL server after an upgrade from an
earlier version.
