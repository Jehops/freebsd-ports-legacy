PgAccess is one of the prettiest GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for
the open source database PostgreSQL.

PgAccess is a cross-platform database management tool for PostgreSQL
written in Tcl/Tk. There are active efforts to turn it into a tool for
writing applications that can work in a distributed client-server
model (a central PostgreSQL database and remote clients).

PgAccess was originally written by Constantin Teodorescu using Visual
Tcl, "the best tool for developing Tcl/Tk applications I've ever
seen." It is currently managed by a growing team of developers.
