Berkeley DB Java Edition is a high performance, transactional storage engine
written entirely in Java. Like the highly successful Berkeley DB product,
Berkeley DB Java Edition executes in the address space of the application,
without the overhead of client/server communication. It stores data in the
application's native format, so no runtime data translation is required.
Berkeley DB Java Edition supports full ACID transactions and recovery. It
provides an easy-to-use, programmatic interface, allowing developers to store
and retrieve information quickly, simply and reliably.
