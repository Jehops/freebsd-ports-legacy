SQLite is an SQL database library that uses GDBM as its underlying
file storage mechanism. Programs that link the SQLite library can
have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process.
The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access program
(sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which
serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
