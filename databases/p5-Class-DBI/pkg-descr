Although the difficulties in serialising objects to a relational
database are well documented, we often find outselves using such a
database to store the data that will make up the objects in our system.

Thus we end up writing many classes, each mapping to a table in our
database, and each containing accessor and mutator methods for each of
the columns.  We then write simple constructors, search methods and the
like for each these classes.

Class::DBI is here to make this task trivial.
