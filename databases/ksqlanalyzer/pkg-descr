The KSqlAnalyzer is a tool for easy accessing the data of a MS-SQL-Database.
It is made for developing and testing new SQL-Query's direclty on the Server.
The functionality and the look&feel are similar to the program 
'SQL-Query-Analyzer' written by Microsoft.

The KSqlAnalyzer is using parts of the TDS-Library (Version 0.60) from the 
FreeTDS-Project.
The parts of the library are included into the software, so that there is no 
need to install these Libraries on the Client-machine.
The Editor is using parts of the KWrite-Sourcecode becaus of the brilliant 
Syntax-Highlighting.
