This is the standalone version of the MySQL storage engine InnoDB.

Made for application developers, device makers and ISVs, Embedded InnoDB
provides all the features of InnoDB in an embeddable form, without the
overhead of the MySQL server.

Embedded InnoDB is used independently of MySQL. It is designed to be linked
directly into application programs, and provides highly efficient, low-level
database management services, not using SQL.

Embedded InnoDB provides concurrency control, sophisticated indexing and crash
recovery. It is used via non-SQL, ISAM-like API for creating and querying
tables and executing other data management functions.
