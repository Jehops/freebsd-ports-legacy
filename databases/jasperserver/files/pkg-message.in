==============================================================================

To use this software package, you need to properly configure and enable an
application and database server. These components need to be enabled,
respectively, in /etc/rc.conf.

The %%DATABASE%% schema and default security credentials have been copied to:

- %%JSHOME%%/js-create.ddl
- %%JSHOME%%/quartz.ddl 
and 
- %%JSHOME%%/jasperserverCreateDefaultSecurity-%%DATABASE%%.sql 

Take necessary precautions before loading this sql into the %%PORTNAME%% database.

To create the %%PORTNAME%% database, you may choose to run the following target against
%%SRCDIR%%/%%PORTNAME%%/buildomatic/js-ant

./js-ant create-js-db (Creates the %%PORTNAME%% database)

If the %%PORTNAME%% database already exists, you may need to first drop the database:
./js-ant drop-js-db (Drops the %%PORTNAME%% database)

Alternatively, you may choose to use the following method to create a suitable database:
 (mysql) mysql> create database jasperserver character set utf8;
 (postgresql) create database jasperserver;

If UPGRADING from 3.5.0 to 4.0:
(taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)

If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then you
must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified" (i.e. fully
QA tested) procedure.

The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the JasperReports
Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will need to download the 
JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant files and documentation.
To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file distribution zip package, go to the
JasperForge.org website and to the JasperServer project.
