To use this software package, you need to properly configure and enable an application and
database server. These components need to be enabled, respectively, in /etc/rc.conf.

The %%DATABASE%% schema and default security credentials have been copied to:

%%JSHOME%%/jasperserverCreate-%%DATABASE%%.ddl
and 
%%JSHOME%%/jasperserverCreateDefaultSecurity-%%DATABASE%%.sql 

Take necessary precautions before loading this sql into the %%PORTNAME%% database.

To create the %%PORTNAME%% database, you may choose to run the following target against
%%PORTSDIR%%/databases/%%PORTNAME%%-%%PORTVERSION%%-src/%%PORTNAME%%/buildomatic/js-ant

./js-ant create-js-db (Creates the %%PORTNAME%% database)

If the %%PORTNAME%% database already exists, you may need to first drop the database:
./js-ant drop-js-db (Drops the %%PORTNAME%% database)

Alternatively, you may choose to use the following method to create a suitable database:
 (mysql) mysql> create database jasperserver character set utf8;
