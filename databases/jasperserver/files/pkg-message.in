==============================================================================

To use this software package, you need to properly configure and enable an
application and database server. These components need to be enabled,
respectively, in /etc/rc.conf.

The %%DATABASE%% schema and default security credentials have been copied to:

- %%JSHOME%%/js-create.ddl
- %%JSHOME%%/quartz.ddl 
- %%JSHOME%%/upgrade-%%DATABASE%%-4.0.0-4.1.0-ce.sql
and 
- %%JSHOME%%/jasperserverCreateDefaultSecurity-%%DATABASE%%.sql 

Take necessary precautions before loading this sql into the %%PORTNAME%% database.

To create the %%JSDB%% database, you may choose to run the following target against
%%SRCDIR%%/%%PORTNAME%%/buildomatic/js-ant

./js-ant create-js-db (Creates the %%JSDB%% database)

If the %%JSDB%% database already exists, you may need to first drop the database:
./js-ant drop-js-db (Drops the %%JSDB%% database)

Alternatively, you may choose to use the following method to create a suitable database:
 (mysql) mysql> create database %%JSDB%% character set utf8;
 (postgresql) create database %%JSDB%%;

You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 if your instance is one of the following:
3.7.0
3.7.1
4.0.0
4.1.0

Note that Jaspersoft did not release a 4.2.0 version of JasperReports Server
Community Project. The version number progression goes from 4.1.0 to 4.2.1
directly. The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the
Installation Guide.

There are no database changes between 4.1.0 and 4.2.1. So, the upgrade from
4.1.0 to 4.2.1 is simpler than upgrading from earlier versions.
