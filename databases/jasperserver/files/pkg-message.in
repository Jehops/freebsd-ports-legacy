==============================================================================

To use this software package, you need to properly configure and enable an
application and database server. These components need to be enabled,
respectively, in /etc/rc.conf.

The %%DATABASE%% schema and default security credentials have been copied to:

- %%JSHOME%%/js-create.ddl
- %%JSHOME%%/quartz.ddl 
- %%JSHOME%%/upgrade-%%DATABASE%%-%%JSUPDATE%%-ce.sql
and 
- %%JSHOME%%/jasperserverCreateDefaultSecurity-%%DATABASE%%.sql 

Take necessary precautions before loading this sql into the %%PORTNAME%% database.

To create the %%JSDB%% database, you may choose to run the following target against
%%SRCDIR%%/%%PORTNAME%%/buildomatic/js-ant

./js-ant create-js-db (Creates the %%JSDB%% database)

If the %%JSDB%% database already exists, you may need to first drop the database:
./js-ant drop-js-db (Drops the %%JSDB%% database)

Alternatively, you may choose to use the following method to create a suitable database:
 (mysql) mysql> create database %%JSDB%% character set utf8;
 (postgresql) create database %%JSDB%%;
