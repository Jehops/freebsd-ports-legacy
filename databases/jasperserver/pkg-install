You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 if your instance is one of the following:
3.7.0
3.7.1
4.0.0
4.1.0

Note that Jaspersoft did not release a 4.2.0 version of JasperReports Server
Community Project. The version number progression goes from 4.1.0 to 4.2.1
directly. The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the
Installation Guide.

There are no database changes between 4.1.0, and 4.2.1. So, the upgrade from
4.1.0 to 4.2.1 is simpler than upgrading from earlier versions.
