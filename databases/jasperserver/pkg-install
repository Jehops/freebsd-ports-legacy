If UPGRADING from 3.5.0 to 4.0:
(taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)

If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then you
must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified" (i.e. fully
QA tested) procedure.

The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the JasperReports
Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will need to download the 
JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant files and documentation.
To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file distribution zip package, go to the
JasperForge.org website and to the JasperServer project.
