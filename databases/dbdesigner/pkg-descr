If you need to build complex SQL databases you will find DbDesigner quite a
useful tool. It allows you to construct your DB in an intuitive and easy to use
environment, where you have a visual representation of the tables and relations
contained in your project. You can quickly see the fields in a table or how
each table relates to the others. After you are finished, DbDesigner can export
the schema of the database into an .sql script, or directly connect to a
database backend and build it there. It can also import already existing
databases from .sql scripts or db backends. Of course, it can save your project
into its native format (XML) so all information is kept (for example you can't
save the positions of the tables in the workspace into an .sql script).  Due to
its plugin architecture, DbDesigner is easily extensible to work with many
database servers. By default it comes with 2 plugins: one for PostgreSQL and
the other for MySQL.  On the other hand, if you are building complex databases
you might have already seen products like this one.
