DBIx::Table is a class designed to act as an abstraction layer
around a fairly large subset of SQL queries. It is called 'Table'
because it is primarily designed such that a single subclass provides
an object-oriented interface to a single database table. The module
is flexible enough, though, that it can be used to abstract most
any schema in a way that is comfortable to the perl coder who is
not familiar with the underlying schema, or even SQL.
