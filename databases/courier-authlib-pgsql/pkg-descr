The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API that
encapsulates the process of validating account passwords. In addition to
reading the traditional account passwords from /etc/passwd, the account
information can alternatively be obtained from an LDAP directory; a MySQL
or a PostgreSQL database; or a GDBM or a DB file.
