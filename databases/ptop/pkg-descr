Ptop is top clone for PostgreSQL.
Similar to top, ptop allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes.
It also allows you to:

    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.
    * View locks held by a process.
    * View user table statistics.
    * View user index statistics.
