This is a sql to oop mapper, inspired by the Class::DBI framework, and
meant to support compability with it, while restructuring the insides,
and making it possible to support some new features like self-joins,
distinct, group bys and more.

It's currently considered EXPERIMENTAL - bring this near a production
database at your own risk! The API is *not* fixed yet, although most of
the primitives should be good for the future and any API changes will be
posted to the mailing list before they're committed.
