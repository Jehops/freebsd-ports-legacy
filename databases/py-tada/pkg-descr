This python module is a wrapper module for any DBAPI 2 compatible database
module. It wraps all functions and methods of the origional module and forces
the return of deferreds instead. tada can therefore be considered to be 'almost'
DBAPI compatible as it inherits the compatiblity level of the wrapped module,
but returns twisted deferreds.

tadah - is an additional class: "Tada with Helpers". This class adds some helper
functionality to tada, but breaks strict DBAPI 2 spec.

tao - uses tada and tadah to create an object model for DB access.  It is loosly
based on the SQLObject project's usage model, but asynchronous.
