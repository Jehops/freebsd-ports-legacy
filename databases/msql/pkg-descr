                  README for Mini SQL Version 2.0 Beta 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Mini SQL 2!  It's been a long time coming but we hope the
wait has been worth it.  As the development of mSQL 2 continues, further
funtionality will be made available.  This release concentrates on
adding the underlying performance and data handling features to mSQL.

The software has changed quite a lot since the 1.x version of mSQL.
Some of the new features are greatly improved support for indexing your
data, much better performance for complex queries and large data sets,
the addition of variable length TEXT fields, support for server managed
numeric sequences, better regular expression handling, and easier
control over the configuration of the server.


FreeBSD-specific port notes
---------------------------

The ports of mSQL 1.x lived in it's own tree, /usr/local/Minerva.  At the
time, mSQL was a part of a larger project called Minerva, to which other
tools would be added.  These other tools would also live in
/usr/local/Minerva.

As of the 2.x release of mSQL, the author of mSQL has put many of these
tools into the base mSQL distribution, and so it is no longer feasible to
have the program live in it's own directory.

So, in keeping with the BSD directory tree structure, you will find the
following changes between the "official" mSQL 2.x distribution and the
FreeBSD port :
