	The port of mSQL 1.x lived in its own tree, /usr/local/Minerva.  At the
time, mSQL was a part of a larger project called Minerva, to which other tools
would be added.  These other tools would also live in /usr/local/Minerva.
	As of the 2.x release of mSQL, the author of mSQL has put many of these
tools into the base mSQL distribution, so it is no longer feasible to have the
program live in its own directory.
	So, in keeping with the BSD directory tree structure, you will find the
following changes between the "official" mSQL 2.x distribution and the FreeBSD
port.
