Tangram is an object-relational mapper.  It makes objects persist in relational
databases, and provides powerful facilities for retrieving and filtering them.
Tangram fully supports object-oriented programming, including polymorphism,
multiple inheritance and collections.  It does so in an orthogonal fashion,
that is, it doesn't require your classes to implement support functions nor
inherit from a utility class.
