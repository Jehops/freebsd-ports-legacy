Updating databases from old versions of Postgis

Due the libpostgis.so.0 path modification, databases created with older 
versions of postgis won't work properly.
To solve this problem, please, make a dump (on text format) of your database 
and use the PREFIX/share/updatedb script.

 sh PREFIX/share/updatedb dump.sql

A new file with '.updated' extension will be created with libpostgis 
references updated.
After that you can restore your database using updated file. 

 psql -f dump.sql.updated database
