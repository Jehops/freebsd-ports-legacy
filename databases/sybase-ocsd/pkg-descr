Searching for a way to contact a Sybase-server from FreeBSD, I found
this tarball with binary static libraries, header files, and some
samples (which this port does not install). Apparently, Sybase thinks
FreeBSD is a version of Linux -- see MASTER_SITES... Sigh.

The tarball available was rolled in 2000, on FreeBSD-3.3 (?) according
to some of the files inside it.

You may have to use the Linux utilities with it, since the tarball
does not even have all things needed to build some of the samples,
such as Sybase's precompiler ``cpre''. But you can then compile and
link native FreeBSD executables.

Don't let the presense of sybase-ase-11.0.3.3-FreeBSD-6.i386.tgz on
the MASTER_SITE fool you -- all of the binaries inside are for Linux,
although they will run under Linux emulation.
