The Sybase's tarball also includes some examples, but they are not
installed by this port. You are welcome to browse them on your own.

You need to set the environment variable SYBASE to PREFIX/sybase
before using the installed libraries or create a user "sybase" and
make PREFIX/sybase its home directory.

The sample interfaces.sample file was installed into PREFIX/sybase.
You'll need to create PREFIX/sybase/interfaces for the things to
work.
