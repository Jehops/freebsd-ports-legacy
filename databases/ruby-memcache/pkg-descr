This is a client library for memcached (www.danga.com/memcached/), a
high-performance distributed memory cache.

MemCache is used to alleviate database load by caching oft-used values
in network-accessable memory space, and is used behind several
high-traffic dynamic web sites like LiveJournal, Slashdot, WikiPedia,
and others.
