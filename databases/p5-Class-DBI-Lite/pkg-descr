Class::DBI::Lite offers a simple way to deal with databases in an
object-oriented way.

One class (the Model class) defines your connection to the database
(eg: connectionstring, username and password) and your other classes
define interaction with one table each (your entity classes).

The Entity classes subclass the Model class and automatically inherit
its connection.
