PostgreSQL is a sophisticated Object-Relational DBMS, supporting
almost all SQL constructs, including sub-selects, transactions,
schemas, and user-defined types and functions. It is the most advanced
open-source database available anywhere.  PostgreSQL is developed
under the BSD license and has many commercial support offerings.

The postgresql-devel is intended for developer use and contains the
latest features in the PostgreSQL tree.  This version is not intended
for production use.  System catalogs may change requiring a reinitdb
and full dump/restore of your database.  Use of the -devel port
implies a fair degree of knowledge of the PostgreSQL development cycle
and that the administrator is tracking changes made to the PostgreSQL
tree.

This port's source tarballs are taken directly from CVS so code may
contain bugs.  Use with extreme discretion.
