The PostgreSQL port has a collection of "side orders":

postgresql-doc
  For all of the html documentation

postgresql-tcltk 
  If you want tcl/tk client support. You get a neat GUI, pgaccess, as
  a bonus!

postgresql-odbc
  For client access from unix applications using ODBC as access
  method. 

ruby-postgres, py-PyGreSQL, p5-Pg, p5-DBD-Pg, postgresql-jdbc
  For client access to PostgreSQL databases using the languages: ruby,
  python, perl, perl DBI, and jdbc.

postgresql-plperl, postgresql-pltcl & postgresql-plruby
  For using perl5, tcl, and ruby as procedural languages.

Note that many files have moved around compared to previous versions
of PostgreSQL. For example, plpgsql.so and all other language modules
are now in /usr/local/lib/postgresql.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

You should vacuum and backup your database regularly. There is a
periodic script, /usr/local/share/postgresql/502.pgsql, that you may
find useful.

To allow many simultaneous connections to your PostgreSQL server, you
should raise the SystemV shared memory limits in your kernel. Here are
example values for allowing up to 180 clients (tinkering in
postgresql.conf also needed, of course):
  options         SYSVSHM
  options         SYSVSEM
  options         SYSVMSG
  options         SHMMAXPGS=65536
  options         SEMMNI=40
  options         SEMMNS=240
  options         SEMUME=40
  options         SEMMNU=120
