======================== BACKUP YOUR DATA! ===========================

As always, backup your data before upgrading! This is a development
port and may change the data format of on disk data as well as the
system catalogs.  It is always advised that you completely dump the
database and re-initdb between upgrades.  This is **NOT** done by the
port!

Press ctrl-C *now* if you need to pg_dump or pg_dumpall.
