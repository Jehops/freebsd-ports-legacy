      * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE *

If you have not backed up your data from the previous version, revert
to using an older copy of this port and dump your data before
proceeding.  Upgrading without performing a dump will likely result in
instability, data loss, interoperability problems, and performance
issues.  It is recommended that you re-initdb between upgrades.  If
you have made a backup, ignore this warning.

Please remember to keep PostgreSQL client installations in sync with
the server.

You might want to add the following tunable to /etc/make.conf

POSTGRESQL_PORT=databases/postgresql-devel

======================================================================

To initialize the database, you should run initdb as the "pgsql" user.
Example:

  su -l pgsql -c initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start

For postmaster settings, see ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
For more tips, read ~pgsql/post-install-notes
