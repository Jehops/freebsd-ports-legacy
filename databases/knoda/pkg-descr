knoda is a database frontend for KDE, based on hk_classes. 

Knoda allows you to:

- define and delete databases;
- create, alter and delete tables and indices;
- add, change and delete data in tables;
- define, execute and store sql queries;
- import and export CSV data;
- define and use forms; and

Its driver concept allows a uniform connection to different 
database servers.
