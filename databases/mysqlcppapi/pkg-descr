mysqlcppapi is a C++ wrapper for the MySQL C API library.

It is a branch of the MySql++ project, but it has diverged significantly for
the following reasons:

* MySQL++ is aggressively optimised for speed, but optimisation should happen
  after the design is mature, and that optimisation should be targeted.
  Premature optimisation obscures the design and prevents it from improving.
* MySQL++ provides too many ways to do things instead of deciding on an
  interface. Again, this obscures the design.
* MySQL++ uses preprocessor macros to an extent that is unacceptable in a C++
  library.
