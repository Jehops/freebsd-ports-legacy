      * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE * IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE *

The PostgreSQL port now obeys hier(7) by default, which means that it
installs into:

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/include/pgsql

You *must* move away your old installation from users' and
ldconfig(8)'s PATHs. If you rather install using the old-fashion
layout, cancel now and build the port with "make -DWITH_OLD_LAYOUT".

The pgsql user's home dir is /usr/local/pgsql by default, but can be
changed with for example chpass(1). Datadir defaults to ~pgsql/data,
but can be changed by modifying the ~pgsql/.profile script.

As always, backup your data before upgrading. If the upgrade leads to
a higher minor revision (i.e. 7.0.x -> 7.1.x), a dump and restore of
all databases is required. This is *NOT* done by the port!

======================================================================

To initialize the database, you should run initdb as the "pgsql" user.

Example:

  su -l pgsql -c initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start

For postmaster settings, see ~pgsql/data/postmaster.conf
