Now that PostgreSQL is installed, you should read the documentation and
implementation guides. These can be found at:

		http://www.PostgreSQL.org/docs

You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the
text "subscribe" in the message body.

If you built PostgreSQL with TCL/TK support, you can use the pgaccess
utility to get a TCL/TK based database frontend for database
operations. You do NOT need to install the pgaccess port separately.

If you built in the TCL support, you can load the Pg package into your
TCL scripts as easily as ``package require Pgtcl''.

To start PostgreSQL, run the startup script:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start
