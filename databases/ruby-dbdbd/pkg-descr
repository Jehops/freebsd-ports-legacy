dbdbd is a tool for reading and writing simple flat-text data files. A
dbdbd data file has record per line, plus optional comments, and can be
edited by hand as well as manipulated with dbdbd. In fact, the main goal
of dbdbd is to provide a semi-automated alternative to ad hoc
text-parsing scripts, in a way that still allows for the option of
editing data files by hand when desired.
