For running slony1 you need:
     slony postgresql superuser with password set
     slony system user (makes auth. of slony db user easier)
     TCP/IP enabled in postgresql (for replication of non local db)

There is a perl script slony_setup.pl which helps you to create initial
configuration. Installing this package do not makes any needed system
changes.
