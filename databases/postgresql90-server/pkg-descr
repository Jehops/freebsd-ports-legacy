PostgreSQL is an enhancement of the POSTGRES database management system, a
next-generation DBMS research prototype.  While PostgreSQL retains the
powerful data model and rich data types of POSTGRES, it replaces the
PostQuel query language with an extended subset of SQL.  PostgreSQL is free
and the complete source is available.

PostgreSQL development is being performed by a team of Internet developers
who all subscribe to the PostgreSQL development mailing list.  The current
coordinator is Marc G. Fournier (scrappy@postgresql.org).  This team is now
responsible for all current and future development of PostgreSQL.

The authors of Postgres95 1.01 were Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen. Many others
have contributed to the porting, testing, debugging and enhancement of the
code.  The original Postgres code, from which PostgreSQL is derived, was the
effort of many graduate students, undergraduate students, and staff
programmers working under the direction of Professor Michael Stonebraker at
the University of California, Berkeley.
