Note for Oracle users:

    In order to connect in a simple way to an Oracle database, it is needed to
    set ORACLE_HOME environment variable and then locate in a
    $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/ directory a valid tnsnames.ora services file.
    Alternatively, you can set TNS_ADMIN to point out directly to that
    tnsnames.ora file.
    
    After that choose "TNS" as "Connection Type" when you are going to add a
    new connection database.


Note for MySQL users:
    
    If you have enabled mysql support, it is needed to point out to SQL
    Developer where the MySQL JDBC classes are. Go to Tools -> Preferences
    menu, select Database -> Third Party JDBC Drivers and add the proper jar.
    Do not install 5.1 version of mysql jdbc connector; see
    http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E25259_01/doc.31/e26419/install.htm#CIHIHDIF
