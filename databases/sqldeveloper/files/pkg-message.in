Note for ALL users:

    The first time sqldeveloper is run, it shows a splash screen and a prompt
    window behind, hidden. By mean of your window manager, grab the edge,
    pull the window over (or move it), and answer the prompt as appropiate.


Note for Oracle users:

    In order to connect in a simple way to an Oracle database, it is needed to
    set ORACLE_HOME environment variable and then locate in
    $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin a valid tnsnames.ora services file. After that
    choose "TNS" as "Connection Type" when you are going to add a new
    connection database.


Note for MySQL and SQL Server users:

    In order to connect to MySQL and SQL Server databases, it is needed to point
    out to SQL Developer where the MySQL and SQL Server JDBC classes are. Go to
    Tools -> Preferences menu, select Database -> Third Party JDBC Drivers
    and choose the file
    %%DATADIR%%/sqldeveloper/extensions/oracle.dbtools.thirdparty.mysql.jar
    and
    %%DATADIR%%/sqldeveloper/extensions/oracle.dbtools.thirdparty.sqlserver.jar
    in the browser.
