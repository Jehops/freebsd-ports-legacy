Note for ALL users:

    The first time this version of sqldeveloper is run, it shows a splash
    screen and a hidden prompt window behind. By mean of your window manager,
    grab the edge, pull the window over (or move it), and answer the prompt as
    appropiate.


Note for Oracle users:

    In order to connect in a simple way to an Oracle database, it is needed to
    set ORACLE_HOME environment variable and then locate in a
    $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/ folder a valid tnsnames.ora services file.
    After that choose "TNS" as "Connection Type" when you are going to add a
    new connection database.

Note for MySQL users:
    
    If you have enabled mysql support, it is needed to point out to SQL
    Developer where the MySQL JDBC classes are. Go to Tools -> Preferences
    menu, select Database -> Third Party JDBC Drivers and add the proper jar.
    Do not install 5.1 version of mysql jdbc connector; see note 7 of
    http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/files/relnotes_v151.html#sec1
