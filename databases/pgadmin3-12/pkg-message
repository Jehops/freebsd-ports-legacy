Make sure that your system is older than

- 600014 for 6.0-CURRENT

or please apply this patch: http://people.freebsd.org/~fjoe/vswprintf.c.diff
and rebuild libc.

You need to use either C or Latin-1 locale OR use locale with multibyte
encoding (any UTF-8 locale, Big5 or EUC locales). pgadmin3 will not work
in single-byte non-Latin-1 locales, for example ru_RU.KOI8-R.
Use ru_RU.UTF-8 in the example above instead.
