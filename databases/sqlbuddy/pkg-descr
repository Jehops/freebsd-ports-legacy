Let's be honest - managing a database isn't terribly exciting. 
But you still want to use a product that looks half-decent and is 
intuitive to use. SQL Buddy was designed to meet the demands of 
modern web developers. Oh, and did I mention that its completely 
open source and free for everyone to use?

Some applications look great in a screenshot, but deliver disappointing 
results when they are actually used. The driving force behind the 
development of SQL Buddy was not to produce a great-looking screenshot 
but rather to create a product that would enable developers to enjoy their 
work and get more done in less time.
