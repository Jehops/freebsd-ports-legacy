XBase is an xbase (i.e. dBase, FoxPro, etc.) compatible C++ class library.

XBASE is useful for accessing data in legacy dBase 3 and 4 database files as
well as a general light-weight database engine.  It includes support for
DBF (dBase version 3 and 4) data files, NDX and NTX indexes, and DBT
(dBase version 3 and 4).  It supports file and record locking.
