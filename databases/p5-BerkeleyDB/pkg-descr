This is the perl5 interface to Berkeley DB version 3, which it
depends on.

You may want to use this, instead of the default dbm that perl
provides, as that one is based on version 1, which is seriously
buggy. E.g., if keys or data are over a hundred bytes or so, bad
things may happen to your dbm files. Never mind all the extra
features....
