phpMinAdmin is a MySQL management tool written in PHP.
Currently it can create database, create/drop/alter
tables, create/drop/alter stored procedures, functions
and triggers, delete/edit/add fields, execute any SQL
statement, and manage keys on fields. The main difference
between phpMinAdmin and phpMyAdmin is that phpMinAdmin
is light-weight.
