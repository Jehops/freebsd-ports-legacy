ZODB, the Zope Object Database, is a persistent object database system for
Python.  It provides facilities to write objects to disk automatically, read
them in again when they're required by a running program, and cache them.

ZODB normally forms part of the Zope application framework by Zope
Corporation (previously Digital Creations).  (See port www/zope.)  However,
it has found significant application outside of Zope.

This port represents StandaloneZODB, an official standalone distribution of
ZODB by Pythonlabs, a division of Zope Corporation.  This official
distribution is now merging with with Andrew Kuchling's third party
standalone repackaging of ZODB that was formerly the focus of this port.

StandaloneZODB includes a standalone version of Zope Enterprise
Objects (ZEO), a tool to distribute ZODB stores across a network.
