ZODB, the Zope Object Database, is a fully-fledged object database system
written in Python.  It forms part of the Zope application framework
by Zope Corporation (previously Digital Creations).  (See port www/zope.)

This port represents a third-party standalone packaging of ZODB by noted
Python developer A.M. Kuchlin <akuchlin@mems-exchange.org> (AMK).  Official
ZODB development is currently being managed by Pythonlabs, a division of Zope
Corporation.  AMK's release of ZODB (and hence this port) will eventually be
superseded by an official Pythonlabs release called StandaloneZODB.

AMK's ZODB package also includes a standalone version of Zope Enterprise
Objects (ZEO), a tool to distribute ZODB stores across a network.  This port
does NOT install ZEO.  A separate port, databases/zeo, is currently under
development.
