The goal of the PySQLite project is to develop a Python extension for SQLite
that conforms to the Python Database API Specification 2.0. SQLite is a
powerful embedded relational database management system in a compact C library.
It offers support for a large subset of SQL92, multiple tables, indices,
transactions and triggers.
