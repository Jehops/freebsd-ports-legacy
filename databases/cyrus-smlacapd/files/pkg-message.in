To enable the acap server, add this line to /etc/inetd.conf :

acap stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/cyrus/bin/frontend frontend

You also need the configuration file /etc/acapd.conf.  A
sample can be found in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/acapd

The configuration file contains the path names for the
directories where the ACAP daemon stores it's data files,
you should create them e.g. by

mkdir /var/acap
mkdir /var/spool/acap
mkdir /var/spool/log
