Firebird 0.9_4 FreeBSD Release Notes                       13-Jan-2001
------------------------------------
FB-T0.9.4.34 Firebird Test1

Welcome to the FreeBSD Firebird port!  Users should note that there
was a package called `firebird-1.0.tgz' released in mid-August
2000.  Unfortunately, that package was released before Firebird
version numbering conventions were established, so although the
version number would suggest that it is newer than the current
release, it is certainly not.  Users of the August 1.0 package
should upgrade to 0.9_4 or later, which has fixed many bugs and
security problems, including the recently-discovered back door.

    Firebird originally required a running copy of Firebird (or
InterBase) in order to build itself.  This port uses a boot kit to
overcome that, so that it does not require itself to build.
Unfortunately, the side effect of this is that if you have a lock
manager running from an already-installed version of Firebird or
InterBase, this port will not build.

    Firebird is installed SUID with owner and group `firebird'.
This does affect where you can and cannot create databases when
connecting remotely, as well as which existing databases you can
access.  If you want a database to be available remotely, be sure
it's readable and writeable to group firebird.

    There may be times when you manage to get your system into a
state where using any of the Firebird utilites (isql, gbak, gsec,
etc.) gives you the message "semget failed".  One surefire way to
do this is to build and install the port.  :)  If this happens,
make sure that the lock manager is not running and its semaphores
have been removed.  The former can be accomplished with 'ps ax
|grep gds' and 'kill'; the latter with 'ipcs -s' and 'ipcrm -s'.

    For example, after building and installing the port, you will
probably go through something like this:

# isql /usr/interbase/isc4.gdb
Statement failed, SQLCODE = -902

operating system directive semget failed
-No such file or directory

# ipcs -s
Semaphores:
T     ID     KEY        MODE       OWNER    GROUP
s 1310720  252034728 --rw-rw-rw-     root    wheel

# ipcrm -s 1310720

and you should be in business.

    Once this is done, you should be able to connect normally to
databases.  Your first connection will restart the lock manager.

    There may be times, however, when you still get "semget failed"
even though the lock manager is not running and the semaphores have
been cleaned up.  There seems to be a conflict with this release
and the PostgreSQL 7 release as installed from the ports collection.
If you're having trouble with Firebird and you're running PostgreSQL,
try stopping PostgreSQL:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/pgsql.sh stop

and see if that helps.

    Complete documentation for InterBase(tm) is available (free of
charge) from http://www.interbase.com/ in PDF format.  While
InterBase and Firebird are two distinct entities, all InterBase
documentation is pertinent to Firebird.  More information on Firebird
and InterBase can be found at the following:
