This module tracks what's being transfered by the Apache web
server in a SQL database (everything with a DBI/DBD driver).
This allows to get statistics (of almost everything) without
having to parse the log files (like the Apache::Traffic module,
just in a "real" database, and with a lot more logged
information).
