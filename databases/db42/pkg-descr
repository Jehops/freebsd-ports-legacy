Version 2.3.11 of the Berkeley DB library. This version uses an
incompatible underlying database format than v1.85 and a different
standard API. Utilities are included in the distribution to convert
v1.85 databases to v2.3.11, and a backwards compatible API is provided to
maintain compatibility with programs using the v1.85 interface.
