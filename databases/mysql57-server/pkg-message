*****************************************************************************

Remember to run mysql_upgrade the first time you start the MySQL server
after an upgrade from an earlier version.

Init. password for first time use of MySQL is saved in $HOME/.mysql_secret
ie. when you want to use "mysql -u root -p" first you should see password
in /root/.mysql_secret

performance_schema feature is set off by default, because of using high RAM.
if you need it enable it yourself :)
