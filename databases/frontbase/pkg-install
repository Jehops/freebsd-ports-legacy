  You will need to obtain and install a valid license string.
  Go to http://www.frontbase.com and request a license

  Once you have obtained a valid license string, install it as follows:

    Create a file ${PKG_PREFIX}/FrontBase/LicenseString with a single line
    consisting of the 64-character license string, followed by a colon (:)
    and the 16-character license check, i.e. a total of 81 characters.

  Once the license file has been installed, restart FrontBase.

  To verify that the license string has been installed correctly, 
  run ${PKG_PREFIX}/FrontBase/bin/FBInfoCenter
