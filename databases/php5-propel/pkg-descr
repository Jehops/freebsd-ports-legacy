Propel is a full-service object persistence and query toolkit for PHP.

It allows you to access your database using a set of objects,
providing a simple API for storing and querying data.  You might
already have heard of this technique, but under a different name, like
Data Access Objects (DAO) or Object Relational Mapping (ORM).
