Support connecting to a postgresql database from a unix client
application using ODBC.

Note: You do not need this port installed on unix if you want to use
ODBC to connect a Windows machine to PostgreSQL.

Since there is an ambition to slim the PostgreSQL distribution, this
software is no longer a part thereof. It is still the offical ODBC
implementation, though.
