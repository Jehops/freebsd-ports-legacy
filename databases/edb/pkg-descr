Enlightenment Database Library

Edb is intended to provide a stable API and file format for archiving 
configuration, theme and other data available all the time for access at 
random really fast. Edb can store any kind of data in key-value pair format. 
Random access reading and writing is FAST as the core of Edb used a berkley. 
Edb provides a convenience API designed to make access fast AND improves access 
speed by caching open db's until a flush and providing conveience macros too. 
It also will be used to store image data and geometry data for theme files so 
the information can be accessed without needing to unarchive files and can be 
edited without having to unarchive and re-archive, and still be accesses at 
random really quickly. Documentation is provided as comments in the Edb.h header 
file.

Edb will be used for all config theme and meta data stroage for E17/EFM
etc. sine it provides FAST random-access read/write of any data wanted
(binary, string, integert, floating point) withotu the need to
unpack/repack files - data can be etxracted and put back at whim with a
simple API from which simple or complex tools can be built.
